Use antibioticsin case of infections
Modify your eating habits
Surgical treatment is indicated in conditions like appendicitis or hernia (inguinal and umbilical) 

Seek doctors advice before going in for any treatment."
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/liver/alcohol-abuse-and-alcoholism,"Alcoholism is a condition when a person have signs of physical addiction to alcohol and continues to drink , despite problems with physical and psychological health. Alcohol abuse is when person's drinking habits leads to problems, but not physical addiction.
These problems can lead to a number of harmful physical, psychological and socioeconomic effects such as alcohol poisoning, cirrhosis of the liver, inability to work and socialize and destructive behaviors(violence and vandalism).
Alcoholism is not a gender related disease.","People who have alcoholism or alcohol abuse often:

Continue to drink, even after knowing the ill effects of drinking
Drink alone
Become hostile when asked about drinking
Unable to control drinking
Make excuses to drink
Miss work or school, or have a decrease in performance because of drinking
Stop taking part in activities because of alcohol
Need to consume alcohol on most days to get through the day
Become violent if somebody tries to stop them to drink

In addition, physical problems also develops. Alcoholics suffer from disturbing memory lapses called blackouts. Alcoholics eat poorly because their irritated liver and inflamed digestive systems leads to heart burns and nausea.

The warning signs are ""slurred speech, alcohol odour"". 
""Dry drunk syndrome"" is a syndrome characterized by short temper, irritability and restlessness.",No Causes.,"The medical professional will perform a physical examination and ask questions about person's medical and family history, including use of alcohol.

Tests to rule out, if a person is alcoholic or not:

• Blood alcohol level
• Complete blood count
• Liver function test
• Magnesium blood test","Treating alcoholism depends on how much a person drinks. Further treatment options are:


Detoxification - It involves a nurse or doctor supporting the person to safely give up drinking. It can be done by helping the person to slowly reduce the alcohol intake over time or by medications. Thus reducing the withdrawal symptoms

Counseling - It includes self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

Medication - There are two main types of medicines to facilitate a person to stop drinking. The first is to help reduce withdrawal symptoms and is generally given in tapering doses over a short period of time.


The most common medicine that’s used in this way is called chlodiazapoxide (Librium). The another medication to reduce any urge that one may have to drink. The most common medications used for this are acamprosate and naltrexone; these medicines are given at a fixed dose and you'll usually be on them for 6-12 months."
Alopecia (hair loss),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/alopecia-hair-loss,"Partial or complete loss of hair is called alopecia. Hair loss usually develops gradually and may be patchy or diffuse (all over). One loses up to 100 hair from the scalp everyday.
Baldness is not usually caused by disease. It is also related to aging, heredity or changes in the hormones. There can be male pattern baldness or female pattern baldness.",No Symptoms.,"There are many reasons for hair loss. It include following reasons:
Hair Disorders

Hereditary thinning or baldness: It is also calledandrogenetic alopecia. It is regarded as the most common cause of hair loss. Hereditary hair loss in men is seen as a receding hairline as well as hair loss on top of the scalp. Women, on the other hand, tends to have their hairline and have visible thinning of hair over the front and top of the scalp.
Alopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. It develops in people of all ages and hair is lost in patches

Cicatricial (scarring) alopecia: It can develop in otherwise healthy men and women, cicatricial alopecia is a rare condition that destroys hair follicles. Scar tissue forms where the follicles once were and re-growth is not possible. Treatment attempts to stop the inflammation that destroys the hair follicles.

Disease

Underlying medical condition: Decreasing hair loss is regarded as warning sign for about 30 diseases. Hair loss often can be stopped or reversed with treatment for the underlying disease. Medical conditions that lead to hair loss are thyroid disease and anaemia caused by an iron deficiency.

Some cancer treatments: Radiation therapy and some chemotherapeutic medications can also cause hair loss. While hair loss is usually temporary, it can be the most distressing part of therapy.

Ringworm of the scalp. Hair loss can also be caused due to fungal infection, which is most common in children, can cause balding and scaling on the scalp.

Trichotillomania. It is a disorder that causes people to repeatedly pull out their own hair. Aside from a constant urge to pull out the hair on the scalp, sufferers often say they feel compelled to pull out their eyelashes, nose hair, eyebrows, and other hair on their bodies.

Stress and Hormones

Stress: Hair loss can also occur if a person is mentally or physically stressed, or after a major surgery, high fever, severe infection, or even flu.

Hormone fluctuations: Any change in hormonal levels can cause hair loss especially in women. Hair loss is common during menopause and after childbirth due to falling oestrogen levels. When hair loss is caused by falling oestrogen levels, the loss is usually temporary. Hair can be re grown .

Diet

Weight loss: People having weight issues can also have hair loss. This hair loss is common, and hair growth does return to normal with proper diet and weight.

Vitamin A excess: Intake of too much vitamin A through vitamin supplements or medications can also lead to hair loss.
Protein intake too low: Hair loss can also occur when the body is not getting enough protein, it conserves the protein. It does get by shifting hair growth into the resting phase. Within 2 to 3 months, the person usually sees visible hair loss. This can be reversed and prevented by eating enough protein. 
Iron intake too low. Consuming too little iron can lead to hair loss. Good vegetarian sources of iron are iron-fortified cereals, soybeans, pumpkin seeds, white beans, lentils, and spinach. Clams, oysters, and organ meats top the list of good animal sources of iron.

Eating disorder. An eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia is the other cause of hair loss.

Medication
Medications that can cause hair loss include:

Blood thinners
High-dose vitamin A
Medicines for arthritis, depression, gout, heart problems, and high blood pressure
Birth control pills: Some women taking or discontinuing birth control pills experience hair loss. This usually occurs in women with an inherited tendency toward hair thinning.

Hair Care Practices

Hair cosmetics: Frequent colouring of hair can cause the hair to break. Regular or improper use of dyes, gels, relaxers, and sprays also can cause hair breakage. Dermatologists recommend limiting use of these hair cosmetics to reduce hair breakage.

Blow dryers, flat irons, and similar devices. Regular use of a blow dryer tends to damage hair. The high heat from a blow dryer can boil the water in the hair shaft leaving the hair brittle and prone to breakage. Allowing the hair to air dry and styling it only when dry will lessen this risk. Dermatologists also recommend limiting the use of flat irons, which straighten hair by using high heat, and other devices such as curling irons.
Hairpins, clips, and rubber bands: If hair are held tightly with hairpins, clips, and rubber bands, it can break hair. To minimize hair breakage, one should use loosely fitting clips and wear them in different areas of the scalp so that hair breakage is not localized in a specific area.
Too much or vigorous grooming: Regular shampooing, combing, or brushing (100 strokes or more a day) or doing any of these too vigorously can cause hair breakage. When hair breakage occurs, the hair appears shaggy or too thin.","Dermatologists can diagnose hair loss by asking questions about medical history, family history. A dermatologist may also carefully look at the scalp to know the condition of scalp.","Treatment of hair loss depends upon the cause of disease.
Treatment available without a prescription


Minoxidil:This medicine is applied to the scalp. It can stop hair from getting thinner and also stimulate hair growth on the top of the scalp. It is the only hair re-growth product approved for men and women. A dermatologist generally combine minoxidil with another treatment.
Laser devices:Brushes, combs, and other hand-held devices that emit laser light also stimulate hair growth. These devices might make hair look more youthful in some people. Because the FDA classifies these products as medical devices, the products do not undergo the rigorous testing that medicines undergo. The long-term effectiveness and safety for these devices are not known.

Prescription medicine
Finasteride:The FDA approved this medicine to treat men with hair loss. It comes in pill form and helps slow hair loss in most (about 88%) men. It helps stimulate hair re-growth in many (about 66%) men. Finasteride works by stopping the body from making a male hormone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

Corticosteroid:If your hair loss is caused by inflammation in body, a dermatologist may inject a medicine called a corticosteroid into scalp. This can help stop the inflammation that happens when a person has alopecia areata. A corticosteroid is different from an anabolic steroid.

Procedures
The type of procedure that a dermatologist recommends will depend on how much hairyou have lost. To achieve the best results, a dermatologist may use one or more of the following procedures:

Hair transplantation:Skin on the scalp that has good hair growth is removed and transplanted to areas of the scalp that need hair.
Scalp reduction:Bald scalp is surgically removed and hair-bearing scalp is brought closer together to reduce balding. Scalp reduction surgery can be performed alone or in conjunction with a hair transplant.
Scalp expansion:Devices are inserted under the scalp for about 3 to 4 weeks to stretch the skin. This procedure may be performed before a scalp reduction to make the scalp more lax. It also can be performed solely to stretch hair-bearing areas, which reduces balding.
Scalp flaps:A hair-bearing segment of scalp is surgically moved and placed where hair is needed."
Anxiety,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/anxiety,"Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state of uneasiness and distress. It is generally characterized by apprehension and worry. An anxiety disorder can have a devastating effect on the person. Most of the people go through this disease and end up in a depression.
Some of the warning signals are:

Intense fear or apprehension
Restlessness
Easily tired
Disturbance sleep
Weight and appetite disturbances","Some of the symptoms include: 

Fatigue
Dry Mouth
Abdominal cramps
Sleep disturbances and headaches
Muscle tension and muscle aches
Difficulty swallowing
Trembling and feeling irritable
Twitching
Sweating and hot flashes","The exact reason for the anxiety is still not known.
Some of the researchers suggest that anxiety disorder is due to an imbalance of certain chemical that is present in the brain, these chemicals are known as neurotransmitter.
Other causes of Anxiety disorder are:

Many people have anxiety, when there is change in their life like: Starting new job, getting married, Having a child, breaking up with the someone.
Some medications can also cause anxiety. These medications include inhaler medicines to treat asthma, thyroid drugs, diet pills.
Caffeine, alcohol and tobacco products may also cause anxiety.",It can be diagnosed by the signs and symptoms. Psychiatric evaluation helps in diagnosing the disease.,"Anxiety can be treated with psychiatric therapy, medication, or both.
Psychiatric therapy: This type of therapy is called cognitive behavior therapy is mainly useful for treating anxiety. It helps a person different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations that help him or her feel less anxious and worried.
Medication: Some time doctors may prescribe medication to help treat anxiety. Two types of medications like anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants. Anti-anxiety medications are powerful and there are different types. Many types begin working right away, but they generally should not be taken for long periods.
Antidepressants are used to treat depression, but they also are helpful for anxiety. They may take several weeks to start working. These medications may cause side effects such as headache, nausea, or difficulty sleeping.
It's important to know that although antidepressants can be safe and effective for many people, but it may be risky for some, especially children, teens, and young adults. Thus it should be taken after doctor's prescription."
Appendicitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/appendix/appendicitis,"Appendicitis is the swelling (inflammation) of the appendix. The appendix is a small, tube like organ attached to the large intestine. The condition is due to blockage inside the appendix. The blockage leads to increased pressure and inflammation. Appendicitis can occur at any age but it is more common during childhood and adolescence.","The main symptom is pain in abdomen. It is dull initially but gets worse over time.
Other symptoms include:

Swelling in the abdomen
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
Constipation or diarrhoea
Inability to pass gas
Low grade fever","The exact reason for acute appendicitis is still unclear. Although, it is associated with the blockage inside the appendix. This blockage can be due to small pieces of faeces, a foreign body or infection.","Diagnosis may include thorough physical examination and careful consideration of the symptoms. If the diagnosis is not clear, then laboratory tests and ultrasound or CT scans may be performed.","Treatment generally include surgical removal of appendix. This procedure is known as an appendicectomy or appendectomy. The appendix is removed using laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery. In this procedure, surgeon uses a slender instrument (laparoscope), which is inserted through tiny incisions (cuts) in the abdomen. This eliminates the need for an abdominal incision."
Autism,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/autism,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of complex neurodevelopment disorders, characterized by social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped pattern of behaviour. It is a brain disorder that typically affects a person's ability to communicate with others. ASD form of disease generally begins in childhood and last through adulthood.
Types of ASDs are:

Autistic Disorder(also called ""classic"" autism): This is most general form of autism. People with autistic disorder typically have significant language interruption, social and communication challenges, and unusual behaviours and interests. Many people with this disorder may also have intellectual disability.
Asperger Syndrome: People with Asperger syndrome, have mild symptoms of autistic disorder. They might have social challenges and unusual behaviours and interests. However, they typically do not have problems with language or intellectual disability.
Pervasive Developmental Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS): It is called as ""atypical autism"". People who meet some of the criteria for autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome, but not all, may be diagnosed with PDD-NOS. People with PDD-NOS usually have fewer and milder symptoms than those with autistic disorder. The symptoms might cause only social and communication challenges.","ASDs generally begin at or before the age of 3 and last throughout a person's life, even though symptoms may improve over time. Most of the children with an ASD may exhibit hints of future problems within the first few months of life. While others, show symptoms until 24 months or later. Some children with an ASD seem to develop normally until around 18 to 24 months of age and then they stop gaining new skills, or they lose the skills they once had.
A child with an ASD might:

Does not react to his/her name by 12 months
Does not play by 18 months
They generally avoid eye contact and stay alone
These children also have difficulty in understanding other people's feelings or talking about their own feelings
These children may show delayed speech and language skills
Repeat words or phrases over and over (echolalia)
Give unrelated answers to questions
Does not like even minor changes
Have obsessive interests
Some time they flap their hands, rock their body, or spin in circles
Have unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel","The exact reason for the causes of ASD is not known, but it’s likely to be associated to genetics and environment factors. Number of genes have been identified that are associated with this disorder.
Studies of patients with ASD have also found irregularities in several regions of the brain.
Other studies suggest that people with ASD have abnormal levels of serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain.
All these abnormalities suggest that ASD could result from the disturbance of normal brain development early in foetal development caused by defects in genes that control brain growth and that regulate how brain cells communicate with each other, possibly due to the influence of environmental factors on gene function.","Diagnosis of ASDs can be difficult as there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorder. Physician may look at the child’s behavior and development to make a diagnosis.
However, the children might receive an audiologic evaluation and a screening test for autism such as Checklist for autism in toddlers.","There is no cure for the disease. However, it can be managed with the help of medications and specialist education.
Early intervention services can help in child's improvement. These services include that help child talk, walk and interact with others.
Therefore, it is important to talk to child's doctor as soon as possible."
Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/acquired-immunodeficiency-syndrome-aids-hiv,"AIDS is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV kills or damages the body's immune system cells.
There are two types of HIV.Type I and Type II. Type I is more common in India.
AIDS is generally caused by unprotected sex with an infected partner. It may also spread through the use of infected syringes of HIV infected people and blood transfusions.
The first sign of AIDS is influenza (flu) like symptoms or may be swollen glands, but at times, symptoms might not appear. Symptoms may appear after two or three months. Generally, blood test is done to confirm the diagnosis. There is no cure, but there are many medicines to fight/ control HIV infection.
National AIDS Control Programme

Prevention, Management and control of RTI &amp; STI","There are 3 main stages of AIDS:
Acute symptoms, clinical latency and severe symptoms
Acute symptoms: The majority of people infected by HIV develop Influenza (flu) like illness within a month or two, after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible symptoms include:

Headache
Fever
Sore throat
Muscle soreness
Rash
Mouth or genital ulcers
Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck
Joint pain
Diarrhoea
Night sweats

Clinical latency:
There is persistent swelling of lymph nodes during clinical latent HIV. Else, there are no specific signs and symptoms. However, body remains infected with the virus.
Severe symptoms:

Headaches
Blurred and distorted vision
Cough and shortness of breath
Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on tongue or in mouth
Soaking night sweats
Shaking chills or fever higher than 100 F (38 C) for several weeks
Chronic diarrhoea
Persistent, unexplained fatigue
Weight loss
Skin rashes","A person becomes infected with HIV/AIDS by several ways:

Blood transfusions:In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions.
Sharing infected needles: HIV can be transmitted through needles and syringes contaminated with infected blood.
Sexual Contact: The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person.
From mother to child:A pregnant woman infected with HIV virus can transmit the virus to her foetus through their shared blood circulation, or an infected nursing mother can transmit it to her baby through her breast milk.","HIV test is done to detect human immunodeficiency virus in saliva, serum or urine. The UNAIDS/WHO policy statement on HIV Testing states that conditions under which people undergo HIV testing must be anchored in a human rights approach that pays due respect to ethical principles . According to these principles, the conduct of HIV testing of individuals must address:
Confidentiality:The entire process of testing and results are kept confidential to give boost toindividuals, couples, and families to learn about their HIV status in the convenience and privacy of their home environment.Home-Based HIV Testing and Counseling (HBHTC) allows rapid HIV tests that are most often used, so that results are available for the client between 15 and 30 minutes. It is:

Accompanied by counselling (for those who test positive).
Conducted with informed consent of the person being tested.

In diagnosis of HIV/AIDS several tests can help physician to determine what stage of the disease it is. These tests include:
Window period:There is a period of time between HIV infection and the appearance of anti-HIV antibodies that can be measured which is called ""window period"".Antibody tests may give false negative (no antibodies are detected despite the presence of HIV) results during the window period, an interval of three weeks to six months between the time of HIV infection and the production of measurable antibodies to HIV sero conversion.
CD4 count: CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that's specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. A healthy person's CD4 count can vary from 500 to more than 1,000. Even if a person has no symptoms, HIV infection progresses to AIDS when his or her CD4 count becomes less than 200.
Rapid or point-of-care tests:The rapid test is an immunoassay used for screening, and it produces quick results, in 20 minutes or less. Rapid tests use blood or oral fluid to look for antibodies to HIV. If an immunoassay (lab test or rapid test) is conducted during the window period (i.e., the period after exposure but before the test can find antibodies), the test may not find antibodies and may give a false negative result. All immunoassays that are positive need a follow up test to confirm the result.
ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay):ELISA is set of blood tests used to diagnose HIV infection. ELISA test is performed by inserting a needle to draw blood. A positive result on the ELISA screening test does not necessarily mean that the person has HIV infection. Certain conditions may lead to a false positive result, such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and lupus.
RNA tests: It detects the virus directly (instead of the antibodies to HIV) and thus can detect HIV at about 10 days after infection, as soon as it appears in the bloodstream, before antibodies develop. These tests cost more than antibody tests and are generally not used as a screening test, although doctor may order one as a follow-up test, after a positive antibody test, or as part of a clinical workup.
Western Blot:A positive ELISA test is always followed by a Western blot test which confirm HIV infection.
*NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any treatment and diagnosis purpose you should consult your physician.","Definitive cure for AIDS is yet to be discovered. However, some medicines, given at certain stage of the disease, depending upon CD4 count in the blood of the patient,can prolong life of HIV positive persons.

Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors - It interferes with a critical step during the HIV life cycle and keep the virus from making copies of itself.
Protease inhibitors - It interferes with a protein that HIV uses to make infectious viral particles.
Fusion inhibitors - It blocks the virus from entering the body cells.
Integrase inhibitors - It blocks an enzyme HIV needs, to make copies of itself.
Multidrug combinations - It combines two or more different types of drugs into one. These medicines help people with HIV, but they are not perfect. They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies. They can still spread HIV to others through unprotected sex and needle sharing, even when they are taking their medicines.

Alzheimer's Disease,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/alzheimer-s-disease,"Dementia is a disorder characterized by serious loss of cognitive ability in a previously unimpaired person, beyond what might be expected from normal ageing. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of dementia. It is more common in older individuals.
Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks of daily living. Although scientists are learning more every day, right now, they still do not know what causes Alzheimer’s disease. Thus it is an Idiopathic disease.
DSM 5 has changed the terminology of Alzheimer’s Disease as “Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease”

Difficulty in spatial relationships like remembering roads and routes to a particular destination
Difficulty in social behavior

STAGES
Pre-dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease:Characterized by level of cognitive decline that requires compensatory strategies and accommodations to help maintain independence and perform activities of daily living.
Mild Alzheimer’s dementia or Major Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease- Mild: Characterized by symptoms which mildly impair activities of daily living so that patient needs supervision over complex tasks, like managing finances etc.
Moderate Alzheimer’s dementia or Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease- Moderate:Characterized by symptoms which moderately impair activities of daily living so that patient needs assistance for some of the activities.
Severe Alzheimer’s dementia or Major Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease- Severe: Characterized by symptoms which severely impair activities of daily living such that patient is completely dependent on others for basic needs.
Patients with severe dementia may lose the ability to walk, talk, and take care for themselves. They need to rely on caregivers to handle even their most basic needs, including eating, washing, and going to the bathroom. They may also have difficulty in communication including telling names of things, or finding appropriate words to express themselves.

http://www.dsm5.org","Scientists have not yet understood the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease. It is postulated to have multifactorial etiology like:
Genetic:The Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene is implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease. This gene has several forms. One of them, ApoE ε4, seems to increase a person’s risk of getting the disease. However, carrying the ApoE ε4 form of the gene does not necessarily mean that a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease, and people carrying no ApoE ε4 can also develop the disease. Most experts believe that additional genes like Presenilin 1, mutation on chromosome 14, APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) mutation on chromosome 21 and Presenilin 2, mutation on chromosome 1 may influence the development of late-onset Alzheimer’s. Scientists around the world are searching for other genes that may increase a person’s risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease.
Environmental/ Lifestyle factors:Diseases like heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia etc. have also shown to be linked with the Alzheimer's disease.

It can tell people whether their symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s disease or another cause, such as stroke, tumour, Parkinson’s disease, sleep disturbances, side effects of medications, or other conditions that may be treatable and possibly reversible.
It also help families plan for their future, make living arrangements and develop support networks. In addition, an early diagnosis can provide greater opportunities for people to get involved in clinical trials.
Although definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's can be made only after death, yet the doctors can usually diagnose the disease with the help of:

Past medical history and current health status
Changes in the behavior and personality of the patient
Conducting cognitive tests involving memory, problem solving, language, etc
Standard medical tests, such as blood and urine tests, in order to rule out other causes
Brain scans including CT/MRI scans","There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; though symptomatic relief can be provided. Current treatments can be divided into Medical, Psychosocial and Care giving.
Medical:
Cholinesterase Inhibitors - Acetylcholine is a chemical that keeps the nerve signals charged and helps the messaging system within the brain cells. Various medications to treat Alzheimer's are:

Donepezil
Rivastigmine
Galantamine

These are used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease
NMDA Receptor blocker

Memantine can be used for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease as well.

Psychosocial:
Psychosocial interventions are used as an adjunct to medicinal treatment and can be classified as supportive, cognitive and behavioural approaches.
Care giving:
Since patient with Alzheimer's has no cure, it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, thus care giving essentially is the treatment and must be managed carefully over the course of the disease."
Anaemia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/anaemia,"The condition of having a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells or quantity of hemoglobin.
Normal results vary, but in general are:

Male: 13.8 to 17.2 gm/dL
Female: 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dL
(Note: gm/dL = grams per deciliter)

Anaemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, and high rates of red blood cell destruction.
Conditions that may lead to anaemia include

Heavy periods
Pregnancy
Ulcers
Colon polyps or colon cancer
Inherited disorders
A diet that does not have enough iron, folic acid or vitamin B12
Blood disorders such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia, or cancer
Aplastic anaemia, a condition that can be inherited or acquired

Anaemia can make you feel tired, cold, dizzy, and irritable. You may be short of breath or have a headache.","The most common symptom of anaemia is fatigue or weakness.
Other signs and symptoms of anaemia include:

Shortness of breath
Dizziness
Headache
Coldness in the hands and feet
Pale skin
Chest pain","Three main cause of anaemia are:

Blood loss
Lack of red cell production
High rates of red blood cell destruction

1) Blood loss: Blood loss is the most common cause of anaemia, especially in iron-deficiency anaemia. Blood loss can be short term or long term depending upon the conditions.
Bleeding in the digestive or urinary tract can cause blood loss. Surgery, trauma, or cancer also can cause blood loss. Heavy blood loss due to menstruation.
If a lot of blood is lost, the body may lose enough red blood cells to cause anaemia.
2) Lack of Red Blood cell production:
It can be due to ""acquired"" or ""Inherited"".
""Acquired"" means that the person is not born with the condition, but may develop it at later stages.
""Inherited"" means that the condition has been passed by the parents.]
Acquired conditions and factors that can lead to anaemia include:
Poor diet
Unusual hormonal levels
Chronic diseases
Pregnancy
Aplastic anaemia can also prevent body from making enough red blood cells. This condition can be both acquired or inherited.
3) High rates of RBCs destruction:
Factors that can cause destruction of red blood cells.
One condition can be an enlarged or diseased spleen.This is an acquired condition.
Inherited conditions are the one when body destroy too many red blood cells. It can be in sickle cell anaemia, thalassemias, and lack of certain enzymes. These conditions create defects in the red blood cells that cause them to die faster than healthy red blood cells.
Hemolytic anaemia is another example of a condition in which body destroys its red blood cells. Both inherited or acquired conditions or other factors can cause hemolytic anaemia. Examples include immune disorders, infections, certain medicines, or reactions to blood transfusions.","Medical History:
Signs and symptoms like weakness, malaise or body aches
Blood tests:
To check for the levels of hemoglobin (it is a protein that transports oxygen)
Red blood cells (cells that contain hemoglobin)is lower than normal.
Physical examination:

Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Rapid or irregular breathing
Enlarged liver or spleen

Complete blood count (CBC):A CBC is generally done to know the number of blood cells in the blood. To check anaemia, physician will see the levels of the red blood cells contained in the blood (hematocrit) and the hemoglobin in blood. Normal adult hematocrit values vary from one medical practice to another but are generally between 38.8 and 50 percent for men and 34.9 and 44.5 percent for women.
A test to determine the size and shape of your red blood cellsSome of red blood cells may also be examined for unusual size, shape and color. This will help in diagnosis. For example, in iron deficiency anaemia, red blood cells are smaller and paler in color than normal. In vitamin deficiency anaemia's, red blood cells are enlarged and fewer in number.","Iron supplements: The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate, taken orally (by mouth) two or three times a day.

Dietary supplements: Iron-rich foods include:

Dark-green leafy vegetables, such as spinach
Iron-fortified cereals
Whole grains, such as brown rice
Beans
Nuts
Meat
Apricots"
Arthritis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/musculo-skeletal-bone-joints-/arthritis,"Arthritis is a disease of joints (inflammation of joints). There aremany typesof arthritis.
Types of Arthritis are:

Osteoarthritis: It is often related to aging or to an injury.
Rheumatoid arthritis: It is the most common form of arthritis.
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: It is a form of the disease that occurs in children.
Infectious arthritis: It is an infection that has spread from another part of the body to the joint.
Gout: It is Inflammation of joints. 

The majorcomplaint of individual is pain in joints which is localized and is often consistent. The pain from arthritis is due to inflammation that occurs around the joint, damaged joint due to daily wear and tear or disease, muscle strains caused by forceful movements against stiff painful joints and fatigue.","The commonest symptoms involve joints. Joint pain and stiffness is common feature along with swelling of joints.
Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid can also affect other organs in the body with a variety of symptoms.

Difficulty in walking
Malaise and a feeling of tiredness
Weight loss
Poor sleep
Muscle aches and pains
Tenderness
Difficulty in moving the joint","When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body are released into the blood or affected tissues. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection and may result in redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause leakage of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This process may stimulate nerves and cause pain.","Physical Examination:It may show swollen, warm or red joints with restriction of movement.
Blood test:This is generally done for rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid factor (RF):It is checked for rheumatoid arthritis. However, RF can also be found in people without RA or with other autoimmune disorders. In general, if no rheumatoid factor is present in someone with RA, the course of the disease is less severe.
Levels of ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels:These are also increased. Both CRP and ESR levels are used to check disease activity and also to monitor how well someone is responding to treatment.
Imaging scans:Like X-ray, CT scans and MRI are commonly used to get the image of bones and cartilage to ascertain diagnosis.","Physical exercise: During pain, exercise seems to be the last option but musclestrengtheningand stretching exercises have proved to be very helpful.
To relieve pain: Pain relievers like NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs). NSAIDs generally interfere with chemicals called prostaglandins in the body, which trigger pain, inflammation, and fever. They are very helpful in relieving pain in all forms of arthritis.
Surgery: Joint replacement surgery is often performed for those who are not able to walk or have lot of difficulty in walking.
Disease-modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs): Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis; DMARDs slow or stop immune system that attack joints. Examples include methotrexate (Trexall) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil).
Intra-articular injection: It is a procedure used in the treatment of inflammatory joint conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, tendinitis, bursitis and occasionally osteoarthritis. A hypodermic needle is injected into the affected joint where it delivers a dose of any one of many anti-inflammatory agents, the most common of which are corticosteroids."
Asthma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/lungs/asthma,"Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing. During an asthma attack, the lining of the bronchial tubes (airways) swells, causing the airways to narrow, turn more sensitive to irritants in the environment, and thus reducing the flow of air into and out of the lungs. The causes of asthma are not completely understood.
However, risk factors for developing asthma include inhaling asthma “triggers”, such as allergens (some common to all and some individualized), tobacco smoke and chemical irritants. Several patients with asthma may also have allergic rhinitis which is characterized by sneezing and “runny” nose. It can start at any age. About half of all people with asthma tend to have their first symptoms by the age of ten years, and many children with asthma have had their first asthma attack before the age of six. Asthma cannot be cured, but appropriate management can control the disorder and enable people to enjoy a good quality of life.","Asthma symptoms can vary in severity with time, can come and go, there may be good and bad periods. Asthma is characterized by:

Recurrent episodes of wheezing
Shortness of breath
Chest tightness
Coughing-sometimes cough may be the only symptom of asthma

Sputum may be produced from the lung due to coughing, small in volume and often in the form of threads and plugs. Symptoms are generally worse at night and in the early morning or in response to allergens.
When uncontrolled, there may be acute asthma attacks often occurring after viral infections (flu, cold), allergen/irritant exposure (pets, pollen, dust, atmospheric pollution, tobacco smoke), exercise, weather changes, medications (aspirin). Danger signs of an acute asthma attack are symptoms not improving after airway-opener inhaler medication, and difficulty in talking due to breathlessness, peak flow-meter readings ranging below 50% of normal value, and require urgent medical attention.
A number of other health conditions are found associated with asthma including:

Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Rhinosinusitis
Obstructive sleep apnea","The exact cause of asthma is yet not known. But there are certain risk factors that are associated with asthma. It is probably caused by interplay of hereditary and environmental factors.
Some of the factors include:

An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe). Children with eczema or food allergy are more likely than other children to develop asthma.
Parents who have asthma (heredity).
Allergens from dust, animal fur, cockroaches, mold, and pollens from trees, grasses, and flowers etc.
Irritants such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemicals or dust in the workplace and sprays (such as hair spray).
Medicines such as aspirin or other non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and nonselective beta-blockers.
Sulfites in foods and drinks
Viral upper respiratory infections, such as colds
Physical activity, including exercise
Contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing.","Medical History: Doctor may also ask:

About one's medical history, including information about allergies, asthma, or other medical conditions.
If one had heartburn or a sour taste in the mouth. These may be signs of gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD).
If one had cold or an episode of flu-like symptoms.
If one smokes or spends time around others who smoke.

Physical Examination &amp; Investigations:To check for signs of problems related to cough; your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. He or she will listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds. Other tests may include:

Chest x ray takes a picture of heart and lungs. This test can help diagnose conditions such as pneumonia and lung cancer.
Lung function tests:These are detailed tests that can measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. Lung function tests can help diagnose asthma and other conditions.
Peak-flow-meter is a simple hand-held instrument that can be used by you to measure one aspect of lung function and monitor your asthma control. It helps in deciding if someone has asthma, determine how bad an asthma attack as well as assess the degree of asthma control. Your doctor can guide you in its use at home, so that you can be cautious about how to increase asthma medication and when seek urgent medical help.
An X- ray of the sinuses:This test can help diagnose a sinus infection.","Medications:Medicines in asthma is generally given through the inhaled route. “Metered dose” and “dry powder” inhalers are equally effective for long term use, the “nebulized” form being generally used during acute attacks. Inhaling a drug is an effective way of taking an asthma medicine as it goes straight to the lungs, with very little ending up elsewhere in the body. There are two types of inhaled medications. Since asthma is an inflammatory disease, preventer medication should not be discontinued without medical advice.
“Airway-opening medication or Quick-Relief” (Reliever) inhaler:The inhaler usually contains a short-acting beta 2-agonist. It works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. Examples of reliever medicines include salbutamol, levo-salbutamol and terbutaline. They are utilized in stopping asthma attacks.
“Controller medication” (Preventer) inhaler:It works to reduce the amount of inflammation and ‘twitchiness’ in the airways and prevent asthma attacks occurring. Examples of preventer inhalers are beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone and mometasone; often combination of these drugs with long-acting bronchodilators like salmeterol and formoterol are used as preventers to stop asthma attacks from starting and thus protect lung function.
Short courses of corticosteroid and other drugs (oral or injectable) may be required during acute attacks and are to be used after medical advice only.
An asthma patient should learn from the care-provider the correct method of using the inhalation devices (metered-dose inhalers, dry-powder inhalers, spacers, etc) used for the medication and always carry the quick-reliever medication with him/her."
Airbag Eye Injury,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/airbag-eye-injury,"Airbag Eye Injury varying from minor abrasions to traumatic hyphaema and secondary glaucoma may result from automobile airbags. Airbags reduce the risk of injury and death from motor vehicle accident, however, injuries attributed to airbag use have been reported. There may be damage to virtually every structure of the eye and adnexa. Most injuries are self- limited and do not significantly affect vision, some result in severe visual loss. Damage to anterior structures of eye is commoner than injury to posterior segment. Posterior segment trauma is generally more visually devastating because of the involvement of optic nerve or retina.
A closer look of the type of eye injuries showed a statistically significant increased risk of corneal abrasion for occupants exposed to airbag deployment. However, occupants from car accidents without airbag deployment sustained a greater number of severe eye injuries. Characteristics of car occupants and crashes, such as seat belt, contact lens, eyeglasses, crash velocity, age and height, are not significantly correlated with the risk of airbag- induced injury.
Rising proportion of airbag- equipped cars as well as the increasing number of people electing for corrective vision surgery are the trends that may increase risk and severity of airbag- induced eye injury.
Awareness of airbag associated eye injuries help in recognising these problems early and help in their management.","Symptoms of automobile airbag trauma varies from the structure of eye and adnexa affected. Eye injuries may lead to

Minor abrasions
Chemical keratitis
Blurring of vision
Traumatic hyphaema
Lens opacity
Secondary glaucoma
Vitreous haemorrhage
Retinal haemorrhage
Commotio retinae
Choroidal rupture
Traumatic optic neuropathy
Fracture of orbit","A motor vehicle crash may produce four collisions

First : Between vehicle and other object
Second : Between unrestrained occupant and the interior of vehicle
Third : Between organs of occupant and the enclosing body wall or cavity e.g. chest wall or skull.
Fourth : Between the occupant and loose objects in the vehicle.

Deceleration forces are dependent on the deforming ability of vehicle. Newer vehicles are designed to deform extensively on impact to reduce forces applied on the occupant.
A deflated balloon stored in the steering wheel is rapidly inflated under high pressure to protect the occupant from steering wheel impact. Other airbags provide protection against striking the dashboard or side panels.
Airbag inflation occurs via a deceleration sensor. Once inflated, vents in the bag permit immediate deflation. Furthermore, timing of the airbag must be adjusted so that it is inflated to its maximum as the occupant impacts on it.
There is evidence that airbags provide excellent protection against serious injury. However, there is increasing data on injuries directly attributable to airbags.
The mechanism of eye injury, in addition to blunt impact from the airbag, includes chemical keratitis from the alkaline products of it.","Diagnosis depends upon the history of motor vehicle accident and clinical findings attributable to the eye injury sustained due to airbag.
Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Airbags drastically reduce both morbidity and mortality from accidents. But with increased use of airbags, there has been a corresponding increase in the number of injuries attributable to it.
There may be damage to virtually every structure of the eye and adnexa. Most injuries do not significantly affect vision.
Alkaline by-products of combustion in airbag expansion may produce chemical keratitis and inflammation of eyes.","Management depends upon the type and severity of injury caused by airbag.
Most eye injuries are self- limited and do not significantly affect vision, some result in severe visual loss. Damage to anterior structures of eye is commoner than posterior segment. Posterior segment trauma is generally more visually devastating because of the involvement of optic nerve or retina.
Patient presenting with ocular inflammation after airbag deployment should have their eyes irrigated with normal saline to remove any alkaline particulate foreign body.
Due to increased risk and severity of airbag induced eye injuries, innovation of airbag and eyewear protection design is needed. One such innovation is the possibility of airbags that would inflate at different speeds depending upon the severity of collision, and the physical characteristics of the occupants."
Anthrax,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/anthrax,"Anthrax
Introduction-
Anthrax is an infectious zoonotic disease (could be transferred from animals to humans). It is primarily a disease of herbivorous animals particularly cattles sheep, goats, horses and mules. The disease naturally occurs among herbivorous animals through contaminated soil and feed; among omnivorous and carnivorous animals through contaminated meat, bone meals or other feeds; and among wild animals from feeding on anthrax infected carcasses. Infected animals shed the bacilli in terminal hemorrhage or spilt blood at death. Anthrax spores can persist in soil for many years.
Humans almost invariably contract the natural disease directly or indirectly from animals or animal products.
Anthrax is existed in many parts of the world, including Asia, southern Europe, sub-Sahelian Africa and parts of Australia. Anthrax also called Malignant pustule, Malignant oedema, Woolsorter's disease, or Ragpicker's disease
Anthrax is enzootic (normally present in an areain animals) in southern India but is less frequent to absent in the northern Indian States. In the past years the anthrax cases have been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Karnataka.
Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), National Centre for disease control (NCDC), Delhi, India reported 6 outbreaks of anthrax in India during the year 2014.
Bioterrorism and Anthrax:
Anthrax is considered an important biological warfare agent because:
(i) it is highly fatal and when transmitted through inhalation is almost always fatal,
(ii) anthrax spores can remain viable for several decades and can be easily produced in large quantities at a very low cost, and
(iii) it is easy to weaponize and disseminate anthrax as an odourless and invisible aerosol which can affect thousands of people at the same time.","Anthrax infection occurs in three forms: cutaneous, inhalation, and gastrointestinal, depending on the mode of transmission. Cutaneous anthrax accounts for most of the cases in endemic situation.
Cutaneous, or skin, anthrax is the most common form. It is usually contracted when a person with a break in their skin, such as a cut or abrasion, comes into direct contact with anthrax spores. The resulting itchy bump rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people can then develop headaches, muscle aches, fever and vomiting. Cutaneous anthrax usually occurs after exposure to infected animals or their contaminated tissues and products such as hair, hides, wool, bones and skin.
Gastrointestinal anthrax is caught from eating meat from an infected animal. It causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning but these can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea.
Pulmonary anthrax- The most severe form of human anthrax is called inhalation or pulmonary anthrax. Though the rarest, it is the form of human anthrax causing the most current concern. This form of the disease is caused when a person is directly exposed to a large number of anthrax spores suspended in the air, and breathes them in. The first symptoms are similar to those of a common cold, but this can rapidly progress to severe breathing difficulties and shock.","Anthrax is caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis, an encapulated and spore-forming bacillus.
Humans generally acquire the disease from infected animals or as a result of occupational exposure to contaminated animal products. Infected animals shed the bacilli in terminal hemorrhage or spilt blood at death. On exposure to the air, the vegetative forms sporulate (formation of spores). Contaminated animal products and vultures who feed on anthrax infected carcasses also spread the organism from one area to another.
Incubation period of the disease is from a few hours to seven days. Most cases occur within 48 hours of exposure.","Laboratory confirmation is made by the demonstration of B. anthracis from the blood, skin lesions or respiratory secretions by direct polychrome methylene blue stained smears, although it is rapid and results are available in 2-3 hours, it is not specific.
Laboratory confirmation can be done by Culture or by inoculation of mice, guinea pig or rabbits. Culture and Identification takes 24-48 hours and gives presumptive diagnosis that needs to be confirmed by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or animal pathogenicity test.
PCR test recommended on suspected bacterial colonies. PCR can also be attempted from the direct sample. Thus, a total of 36 to 48 hours are required to confirm the diagnosis.",Anthrax responds well to antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics must be prescribed and taken with medical advice. Nobody should attempt to use antibiotics or any other drugs to treat or protect themselves without first getting medical advice.
Amoebiasis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/amoebiasis,"Amoebiasis
Amoebiasis is a disease caused by the parasiteEntamoeba histolytica. Only about 10% to 20% of people who are infected withE. histolyticabecome sick from the infection. It can affect anyone, although it is more common in people who live in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions.
Amoebiasis is a common infection of the human gastro-intestinal tract. Amoebiasis is more closely related to poor sanitation and socioeconomic status than to climate. It has worldwide distribution. It is a major health problem in China, South East and West Asia and Latin America, especially Mexico.
Amoebiasis affects about 15% of Indian population. It has been reported throughout India.
In addition to being a potentially lethal disease, invasive amoebiasis has important social and economic consequences. Temporarily incapacitating infections, which are frequent in adult males in the wage-earning age group, may require several weeks of hospitalization and 2-3 months for full recovery. Amoebiasis may cause clinical problems in persons with immunodeficiency, homosexuals and immigrants from certain tropical countries, and travellers.","The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection, diarrhoea and dysentery to fulminant colitis and peritonitis as well as extra-intestinal amoebiasis.
Acute amoebiasis can present as diarrhoea or dysentery with frequent, small and often bloody stools.
Chronic amoebiasis can present with gastrointestinal symptoms plus fatigue, weight loss and occasional fever.
Extra-intestinal amoebiasis can occur if the parasite spreads to other organs, most commonly the liver where it causes amoebic liver abscess. Amoebic liver abscess presents with fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain.
Other organs can also be involved, including pleuropulmonary, cardiac, cerebral, renal, genitourinary, peritoneal, and cutaneous sites. In developed countries, amebiasis primarily affects migrants from and travellers to endemic regions, men who have sex with men, and immunosuppressed or institutionalized individuals.","Amoebiasis is caused by parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Several protozoan species in the genusEntamoebacolonize humans, but not all of them are associated with disease. It exists in two forms- Vegetative (trophozoite) and cystic forms (cyst). Trophozoites multiply and encyst in the colon. The cysts are excreted in stool and are infective to humans. Cysts remain viable and infective for several days in faeces, water, sewage and soil in the presence of moisture and low temperature.
Transmission occurs via:

Faecal–oral route, either directly by person-to-person contact or indirectly by eating or drinking faecally contaminated food or water.
Sexual transmission by oral-rectal contact is also recognized especially among male homosexuals.
Vectors such as flies, cockroaches and rodents can also transmit the infection.

The incubation period forE histolyticainfection is commonly 2-4 weeks but may range from a few days to years.
The use of night soil for agricultural purposes favours the spread of the disease. Epidemic/ outbreaks (occurrence of more cases of a disease than would be expected in a community or region during a given time period) are usually associated with sewage seepage into the water supply.","Entamoeba histolyticamust be differentiated from other intestinal protozoa. Microscopic identification of cysts and trophozoites in the stool is the common method for diagnosingE. histolytica. Differentiation is based on morphologic characteristics of the cysts and trophozoites.
In addition,E. histolyticatrophozoites can also be identified in aspirates or biopsy samples obtained during colonoscopy or surgery.
Immunodiagnosis -
Antibody Detection-
a) Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is most useful in patients with extra-intestinal disease (i.e., amoebic liver abscess) when organisms are not generally found on stool examination.
b) Indirect hemagglutination (IHA).
If antibodies are not detectable in patients with an acute presentation of suspected amoebic liver abscess, a second specimen should be drawn 7-10 days later. If the second specimen does not show sero-conversion, other tests should be considered.
DetectableE. histolytica-specific antibodies may persist for years after successful treatment, so the presence of antibodies does not necessarily indicate acute or current infection.
Antigen Detection-
Antigen detection may be useful as an adjunct to microscopic diagnosis in detecting parasites and to distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic infections.
Molecular Diagnosis-
Conventional Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-In reference diagnosis laboratories, molecular analysis by PCR-based assays is the method of choice for discriminating between the pathogenic species (E. histolytica) and the nonpathogenic species (E. dispar).
Radiography, Ultrasonography, Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)can be used for detection of liver abscess, cerebral amoebiasis.
Rectosigmoidoscopy andcolonoscopy can provide diagnostic information in intestinal amoebiasis.

Asymptomatic patients infected withE.histolyticashould also be treated with antiamoebic drugs, because they can infect others and because 4%–10% develop disease within a year if left untreated.
Liver aspiration- Liver aspiration is indicated only if abscesses are large (&gt; 12 cm), abscess rupture is imminent, medical therapy has failed, or abscesses are present in the left lobe."
Atherosclerosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/cardio-vascular/heart/atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to heart and other parts of your body.
Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to organs and other parts of your body.
Atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, includingheart attack,stroke, or even death.","Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause signs and symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have the disease until they have a medical emergency, such as heart attackorstroke.
Some people may have signs and symptoms of the disease. Signs and symptoms will depend on which arteries are affected.
Coronary Arteries
The coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to heart. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease calledcoronary heart disease, or CHD), it may lead to angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.
Angina may feel like pressure or squeezing in chest. Pain may also be felt in shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain.
Other symptoms of CHD are shortness of breath andarrhythmiasArrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.
Plaque also can form in the heart's smallest arteries. This disease is calledcoronary microvascular disease(MVD). Symptoms of coronary MVD include angina, shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), and lack of energy.
Carotid Arteries
The carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to brain. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease calledcarotid artery disease), one may have symptoms of stroke. These symptoms may include:

Sudden weakness
Paralysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body
Confusion
Trouble speaking or understanding speech
Trouble seeing in one or both eyes
Difficulty in breathing
Dizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls
Loss of consciousness
Sudden and severe headache

Peripheral Arteries
Plaque also can build up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis (a disease calledperipheral artery disease).
If these major arteries are narrowed or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and sometimes dangerous infections.
Renal Arteries
The renal arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to kidneys. If plaque builds up in these arteries, one may developchronic kidney disease. Over time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function.
Early kidney disease often has no signs or symptoms. As the disease gets worse, it can cause tiredness, changes in how you urinate (more often or less often), loss of appetite, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), swelling in the hands or feet, itchiness or numbness and trouble concentrating.","The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, studies show that atherosclerosis is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. It develops faster as you age.
Atherosclerosis may start when certain factors damage the inner layers of the arteries. These factors include:

Smoking
High amounts of certain fats andcholesterolin the blood
High blood pressure
High amounts of sugar in the blood due toinsulin resistanceordiabetes

Risk Factors
The exact cause of atherosclerosis is not clear but certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the more likely it is that you'll develop atherosclerosis.
Major Risk Factors

Unhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called ""good"" cholesterol).
High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes orchronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercury—the units used to measure blood pressure.)
Smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, raise cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also doesn't allow enough oxygen to reach body tissues.
Insulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body can't use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it's used as an energy source. Insulin resistance may lead to diabetes.
Diabetes. With this disease, the body's blood sugar level is too high because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly.
Overweight or obesity. The terms ""overweight"" and ""obesity"" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.
Lack ofphysical activity. A lack of physical activity can worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight and obesity.
Unhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Foods that are high in saturated andtransfats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other atherosclerosis risk factors.
Older age. As one gets older, risk for atherosclerosis increases. Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in arteries with ageing. By the time you're middle-aged or older, enough plaque has built up to cause signs or symptoms. In men, the risk increases after the age of 45. In women, the risk increases after the age of 55.
Family history of early heart disease. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age.","Physical Exam
Physical examination may show weak or absent pulse (e.g. in leg or foot). A weak or absent pulse can be a sign of blocked artery.
Diagnostic Tests
One or more tests may be required to diagnose atherosclerosis. Extent of disease so determined by tests, helps in planning the treatment.
Blood Tests
Blood testscheck the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in blood. Abnormal levels may be a sign that you're at risk for atherosclerosis.
ECG (Electrocardiogram)
An ECG can show signs of heart damage caused by CHD. The test also can show signs of a previous or currentheart attack.
Chest x- Ray
Achest x- raytakes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs ofheart failure.
Ankle/Brachial Index
This test compares the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm to see how well your blood is flowing. This test can help diagnose P.A.D (Peripheral Arterial Disease).
Other Tests
Other tests are being studied to see whether they can give a better view of plaque build up in the arteries. Examples of these tests include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).","Management for atherosclerosis may includeheart-healthy lifestyle changes,medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include:

Lowering the risk of blood clot forming
Preventing atherosclerosis-related diseases
Reducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the build up of plaque
Relieving symptoms
Widening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries

Medicines
Sometimes lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough to control cholesterol levels. For example, one may also need statin medications to control or lower cholesterol. By lowering blood cholesterol level, one can decrease chances of having a heart attack or stroke.
Medical Procedures and Surgery
Patients with severe atherosclerosis may require a medical or surgical procedure."
Adult Inclusion Conjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/adult-inclusion-conjunctivitis,"Adult inclusion conjunctivitis or Paratrachoma results due to infection by obligate intracellular bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D to K), which causes chronic follicular conjunctivitis (follicular conjunctivitis lasting for more than 16- 28 days). These organisms infect the epithelium of mucoid surfaces and were once identified as the trachoma-inclusion conjunctivitis agents (TRIC agents). These organisms can also infect a neonate during birth and may lead to neonatal conjunctivitis.
Chlamydia trachomatis also includes the agents of classic trachoma (serotypes A, B, Ba and C). Lymphogranuloma venereum, a sexually transmitted infection, is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes L1 to L3) which infect tissues deeper to the epithelium.
Adult inclusion conjunctivitis is transmitted sexually (oro-genital activities) or from hand-to-eye contact. Gonorrhoea is the most common co-infection associated with adult inclusion conjunctivitis. Rarely, adult inclusion conjunctivitis is transmitted through eye-to-eye contact (e.g. by sharing mascara).","Adult inclusion conjunctivitis presents as a unilateral (less commonly bilateral) affliction of eye.
Symptoms do not always exist with adult inclusion conjunctivitis in large number of patients and is often transmitted unknowingly.
Almost half of patients with adult inclusion conjunctivitis do not have a systemic infection of Chlamydia. In addition to eye, Chlamydiae are found in parts of the body with mucosal membrane such as respiratory tract and the genitourinary tract.
Symptoms of adult inclusion conjunctivitis may wax and wane and the patient may be asymptomatic.
Patient may present with symptoms like:-
Ocular (Eye) symptoms:
- Red eye.
- Muco-purulent discharge.
- Sticking of eyelashes on awakening.
- Watering.
- Itching.
- Irritation of eyes.
- Foreign body sensation.
- Photophobia or intolerance to light.
- Pain.
- Swelling of eyelids.

Systemic symptoms:
- Urethritis in males.
- Genito-urinary symptoms viz. urethritis, vaginal discharge in females.
- Mild ear infection on same side of infected eye.
-Mild pre-auricular lymphadenopathy.","Chlamydia trachomatis causes trachoma (serotypes A, B, Ba and C) and also genital infections (serotypes D to K) and disease Lymphogranuloma venereum (serotypes L1 to L3).
Infection with genital serotypes D to K can cause isolated episodes of ophthalmia neonatorum in infants or inclusion conjunctivitis in adults. The incubation period for adult inclusion conjunctivitis is 4-12 days.
Genital serotypes do not cause trachoma blindness since they do not enter stable transmission cycles within communities. Serotypes D to K occasionally cause subacute follicular conjunctivitis but conjunctival scarring is rare.
Usually, adult inclusion conjunctivitis is observed in young sexually active people. It is most common in persons aged 15-35 years.","Diagnosis of adult inclusion conjunctivitis depends upon clinical presentation and laboratory diagnosis.
Women with chlamydial infection often have a concomitant urethritis or vaginal discharge secondary to chronic vaginitis and/or cervicitis. Men may have symptomatic or asymptomatic urethritis.
Often, history of patient reveals that this condition has been going on for several weeks. Usually, bacterial infections run a much shorter clinical course of one to two weeks only.
Adult inclusion conjunctivitis usually presents as unilateral (less commonly bilateral) conjunctival redness with mucopurulent discharge, papillary hypertrophy and a predominant follicular conjunctivitis. Untreated disease has a chronic remittent course and may last for months together.
Knowledge of duration of symptoms, any prior treatment taken and recent and not-so-recent history of sexual exposure is important in diagnosis.
Clinical features:
Patient may have tender enlarged pre-auricular lymph node.
Slit-lamp examination by an eye-specialist is required.
Ocular clinical features may include:- 
- Inferior tarsal conjunctival follicles.
- Papillary hypertrophy and injection in superior tarsal conjunctiva.
- Keratitis (may develop during second week after onset). Corneal involvement includes:
Superficial punctate keratitis.
Small marginal or central infiltrates.
Sub-epithelial infiltrates (tend to be more peripheral).
Superior limbus pannus.
- Limbal swelling.
- Iritis (may develop in late stages of disease).
Laboratory diagnosis:
- Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs): Nucleic acid amplification test is the best laboratory technique, of which polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an example.
NAATs have high sensitivity and specificity but are expensive and not widely available.
- Giemsa cytology: Giemsa cytology is microscopic examination of stained conjunctival scrapings for basophilic intra-cytoplasmic epithelial inclusion bodies (Halberstaedter-Prowazek bodies). This test is highly specific but has low sensitivity.
- Chlamydial culture: Chlamydial cultures may be obtained from conjunctiva.
- Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assay: Direct fluorescent antibody assay of conjunctival smears is less sensitive than NAATs.
- Enzyme immunoassay (EIA): Enzyme immunoassay of conjunctival smears is also less sensitive than NAATs
- Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers: Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers may be obtained against chlamydia species.

Adult inclusion conjunctivitis should be differentiated from conditions like:
- Trachoma.
- Epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis.
- Superior limbic kerato-conjunctivitis.
- Allergic conjunctivitis.
- Bacterial conjunctivitis.
- Viral conjunctivitis.
- Molluscum contagiosum.
- Complications of contact lens use.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Adult inclusion conjunctivitis is usually self-limiting.
To prevent re-infection, all sexual partners should be treated simultaneously. All sexual partners should also be examined for other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhoea, syphilis and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is prudent to treat all members of the household with antibiotics. There should be abstinence from sexual activity until the course of treatment is complete.
The goal of pharmacotherapy is to reduce morbidity and to prevent any complications.
Empiric antimicrobial therapy must be comprehensive and should cover all likely pathological organisms.
Conjunctivitis is usually an ocular manifestation of a sexually transmitted uro-genital infection. Therefore, adult inclusion conjunctivitis does not respond and topical use of antibiotic is relatively not effective.
Patients should be followed-up for about 2-6 weeks after initiation of treatment, depending upon the severity of initial symptoms.
Treatment consists of:
- Systemic antibiotics: Systemic antibiotics are usually recommended for about 3-6 weeks. Systemic oral antibiotics such as erythromycin, azithromycin, tetracycline or doxycycline may be used.

‘Single-dose azithromycin should be considered as equally reliable treatment option, comparing to long-term alternative regimens for adult inclusion conjunctivitis. Patients should wait for one week, until first signs of significant regression become obvious and should consider approximately one month to total relief. Follicles could be reasonably used as a key sign for clinical assessment of treatment success’ (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/24047438 ).

Tetracyclines are avoided in children less than seven years of age and in women who are pregnant or are breastfeeding the babies.

- Topical antibiotics: Topical antibiotics are relatively ineffective.

Prognosis:
Prognosis is usually good if treatment is initiated early and the entire course of antibiotics is completed. Re-infection is very common and is due to non-treatment of infected sexual partners or acquisition from a new partner. Therefore, all sexual partners should be treated.
Untreated chlamydial infection can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and scarring of fallopian tubes in women, causing infertility/sterility or ectopic pregnancy. Chlamydial salpingitis and tubo-ovarian abscess may rupture and lead to peritonitis. Chlamydia is an indirect cause of mortality from ectopic pregnancies."
Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/atopic-keratoconjunctivitis,"Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a relatively uncommon, but potentially blinding ocular (eye) disease, which typically affects young people with atopic dermatitis. AKC is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva which may have dramatic consequences for visual function.
The incidence of atopic dermatitis is greatest in paediatric population. AKC may occur at any time after the onset of the associated dermatitis or other atopic condition, and is not necessarily correlated with exacerbations of these conditions. The initial presentation of ocular symptoms in AKC most commonly occurs in the second to third decade of life, with some patients presenting earlier or later (range varies from late teens to 50 years with peak age of incidence in people aged 30-50 years). Visually significant complications most frequently occur in the fourth to fifth decades, with more men affected than women. The condition then remains chronic for years, usually requiring lifelong treatment. An earlier onset of AKC carries the greatest risk for tear film abnormalities and greater ocular surface damage. Classically involved skin areas of atopic dermatitis are lateral neck folds, antecubital (in-front of the elbow) and popliteal (back of knee joint) fossae, but may involve other parts of body including eyelid.
In the year 1952, Hogan described bilateral conjunctivitis occurring in patients with atopic dermatitis (coined the term atopic keratoconjunctivitis), which flared-up with worsening dermatitis. Patients notably showed chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis may evolve independent of dermatitis in some patients. Hogan’s criteria to aid in diagnosis is presence or history of eczematous dermatitis, a family history of atopic disease, associated allergies (asthma, hay fever), eosinophilia and a characteristic keratoconjunctivitis associated with exacerbations of dermatitis. His patients were notable for chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation.
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). The potential for corneal involvement and opacification increases significantly with the CACs because of the severity and sustained nature of their inflammation. In seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement is rare. However, clinical and patho-physiological features of AKC are quite different from other allergic conjunctivitis. AKC like vernal keratoconjunctivitis, is a severe inflammatory disease, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment. The highest incidence of visual loss is therefore, found in AKC, the most chronic of these disorders.
Chronic allergic conjunctivitis characteristically involves an Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated type I hypersensitivity response, manifested by papillary conjunctivitis, with itching as a universal early symptom. Hypersensitivity reactions associated with type I and a prominent T-cell mediated type IV response, along with variety of other inflammatory cell types and cytokines, contribute to the inflammatory changes of conjunctiva and cornea seen in AKC.
AKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively, while SAC and PAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis.
AKC tends to be chronic and unremitting, with a relatively low expectation of eventual resolution, and is associated with significant ocular morbidity. VKC is more frequently seasonal, and is generally worse in the spring season. AKC tends to be perennial and is often worse in winter. Patients are sensitive to a wide range of airborne environmental allergens.","Unlike SAC, symptoms of AKC are usually present year-round, though a significant number of patients may have seasonal exacerbations.
Ocular symptoms of AKC:
- Moderate to severe Itching.
- Tearing of eyes.
- Irritation.
- Burning sensation.
- Dermatitis of eyelids and peri-orbital skin.
- Peri-orbital hyper-pigmentation.
- Chronic eyelid oedema and inflammation.
- Entropion (inward turning of eyelid).
- Ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid).
- Lagophthalmos (incomplete or defective closure of eyelids).
- Madarosis (loss of eyelashes).
- Redness of eyes.
- Stringy mucoid discharge.
- Difficulty in opening the eyes on awakening.
- Discomfort in eyes.
- Photophobia (sensitivity to light).
- Pain.
- Blurring of vision.","Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a chronic allergic conjunctivitis and may be due to:
Hypersensitivity response:
All ocular allergic disorders are characterised by a hypersensitivity response, defined as an excessive reaction of the normal immune system, usually by exposure to an inciting antigen.
Type I hypersensitivity, or IgE mediated immediate hypersensitivity, predominates in PAC and SAC, but is also involved in other CACs, including AKC. Serum IgE levels are chronically elevated in AKC patients but their levels are not necessarily correlated to severity of disease. IgE levels in tear samples are also increased in AKC, and correlate with serum IgE levels.
AKC additionally involves a chronic inflammation of the ocular surface; a type IV delayed hypersensitivity response, where an immediate antigen is not easily identified.
Genetic predisposition:
A genetic predisposition combined with antigen sensitisation is suspected in AKC and its associated disease, atopic dermatitis. AKC may, however, represent either a common manifestation end point for a number of abnormal gene processes, or a single gene defect with variable phenotypic expression, modified by other gene polymorphisms and the environment.
Epithelial barrier defect:
More recent studies suggest that an epithelial barrier defect may be responsible rather than a defect in immune-regulatory function.

Atopic (genetic tendency to develop allergic disease) systemic diseases with which AKC may be associated are:
- Dermatitis is most common.
- Eczema.
- Asthma.
- Hay Fever.
- Migraine.
- Urticaria (hives).
- Rhinitis.
- Food allergies (less common).
- Non-hereditary angioedema (less common).
AKC may be associated with other ocular diseases like:
- Keratoconus.
- Anterior sub-capsular cataract.
- Posterior sub-capsular cataract.
- Chronic staphylococcal blepharitis.
- Retinal detachment.","Diagnosis of AKC is based upon typical clinical features.
Despite facts suggesting immune responses in the pathogenesis of VKC, no clinical or laboratory test has evolved to support the diagnosis in atypical cases or predict the course of disease.
History of atopy in patient or the family, elevated serum level of total and specific IgE, higher number of eosinophils and mast cells, increased level of mediators and favourable response to anti-allergic therapy is observed in AKC.

Ocular clinical features:
Peri-orbital features:
-Dermatitis: Scaling, flaky dermatitis consistent with eczema on peri-orbital skin.
-Hyperpigmentation: Peri-orbital hyper-pigmentation, which may lighten in response to control of inflammation.
-de Hertoghe sign: de Hertoghe sign or absence of lateral eyebrow, is occasionally seen and may be related to chronic eye rubbing.
Eyelids:
-Dermatitis: Scaling, flaky dermatitis with reddened base, consistent with eczema on eyelids.
-Vertical corrugations: Vertical corrugations near medial canthus of upper and lower eyelid may result.
-Fissured eyelid skin: Eyelid skin is often fissured.
-Eyelid margin thickening: Eyelid margins may be thickened, oedematous and hyperaemic.
-Dennie-Morgan lines: Eyelid oedema may lead to Dennie-Morgan lines, single or double creases in the lower eyelid, secondary to chronic eye rubbing.
-Lateral canthal ulceration: Lateral canthal ulceration related to chronic tearing may be present.
-Lid mal-position: Lid mal-position may result from chronic eyelid oedema and inflammation, resulting into:
 1. Ectropion (outward turning of eyelid).
 2. Ptosis. 
 3. Lagophthalmos may result from chronic eyelid oedema and inflammation.
-Madarosis: Madarosis may also result from chronic eyelid oedema and inflammation. Lid margins may show loss of cilia and punctal ectropion.
-Permanent lid swelling: Chronic oedema may lead to permanent lid swelling, a hallmark of long-standing atopic eye disease.
-Eyelid margin keratinisation: Keratinisation of eyelid margins is sometimes observed, along with associated meibomitis (inflammation of meibomian glands) and obliteration of meibomian glands.

Conjunctiva:
-Palpebral conjunctiva: Palpebral conjunctiva shows papillary hypertrophy, more prominent on lower tarsus.
-Giant papillae: Giant papillae like VKC may form.
-Oedema: Diffuse sheet-like infiltration of conjunctiva may lead to pale white oedema and obscuration of blood vessels. Bulbar conjunctiva typically displays diffuse chemosis and injection.
-Conjuctival scarring: Conjuctival scarring may occur, often in reticular or septal pattern.
-Symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation: Sub-epithelial fibrosis can, in severe cases, lead to symblepharon formation.
-Forniceal foreshortening: Forniceal foreshortening may also result from sub-epithelial fibrosis.
-Limbus: Limbus may become infiltrated and oedematous, and develop gelatinous limbal thickening, consisting of confluent macro-papillae, is sometimes seen.
-Trantas dots: Trantas dots, tiny white lesions consisting of necrotic epithelial cells and eosinophils, may be observed, similar to those in VKC.
Cornea:
Corneal disease may be complicated by late development of corneal hypaesthesia in patients with AKC, resulting in a paradoxic reduction in surface symptoms, including itching.
-Punctate epithelial keratopathy: Punctate epithelial keratopathy is the most common corneal finding.
-Filamentary keratitis: Filamentary keratitis may occur, sometimes with very thick mucoid filamentary strands and possibly related to tear film instability, due to goblet cell abnormalities and deficient mucin secretion, also commonly featured in AKC.
-Persistent epithelial defects: Persistent epithelial defects frequently occur in the setting of a dry and inflamed ocular surface and may eventually lead to macro-erosions. Macro-erosions in atopic patient may progress to frank bacterial ulcers.
-Atopic shield ulcers with ‘vernal’ plaque formation: Atopic shield ulcers with ‘vernal’ plaque formation may also develop. Adherent mucus plaques contain epithelial debris, eosinophils, and inflammatory cells, and probably result from a combination of mechanical irritation from giant papillae, as well as toxic epithelial changes secondary to inflammation. Persistence of these plaques may eventually cause stromal thinning and perforation. The chronic inflammation and mechanical insult from palpebral scarring may result in partial or total limbal stem cell deficiency. Chronic inflammation and superimposed infection may lead to corneal scarring, neovascularisation, and lipid deposition. Vision may decline due to obscuration of the visual axis, irregular astigmatism, and/or ocular surface compromise.
-Pannus formation: Severe pannus often develops, typically affecting the superior one-third of the cornea.
-Pseudogerontoxon: Pseudogerontoxon may be seen in the peripheral cornea, which resembles a short, circumferential segment of arcus-senilis (white or grey opaque ring in corneal margin). This localised area of lipid deposition, related to abnormal vascular permeability at the limbus, may be the only evidence of previous atopic disease in a quiet eye.
Other complications/features:
-Eyelid inflammation: Eyelid inflammation is common in AKC, often related to staphylococcal blepharitis. Patients with atopic dermatitis are found to have high rates of bacterial skin colonisation, specifically with staphylococcal species.
-Corneal super-infections: AKC patients are at higher risk of corneal super-infections because of an unstable ocular surface, the local bacterial colonisation of the eyelids, and a dysfunctional innate immune system. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis, frequently bilateral, is another well known complication of AKC, and is presumably related to abnormalities in the atopic host’s immune defences. Herpetic epithelial lesions may be recurrent, especially when topical or systemic immune-suppressants are required to control the atopic state. Management is especially difficult because epithelial AKC lesions may be difficult to distinguish from HSV keratitis.
-Development of cataract: Rapidly progressive cataracts frequently develop in AKC patients, classically described as anterior sub-capsular opacities, usually stellate or shield like in appearance. The pathogenesis for atopic cataract is unclear, and it is suggested that high levels of IgE may be correlated with development of cataract in these patients. The chronic use of topical steroids also predisposes to posterior sub-capsular cataracts in AKC patients. Other forms of cataract may form independent of corticosteroid use, especially in patients with severe systemic atopic disease.
-Keratoconus: A higher incidence of keratoconus is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.
-Pellucid marginal degeneration: A higher incidence of pellucid marginal degeneration is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.
-Retinal detachment: Slightly higher rate of retinal detachment has also been noted in AKC patients. This may also be related to chronic eye rubbing, inducing degenerative vitreous changes.
Histological/ Immuno-histochemical studies:
Histological/ Immuno-histochemical studies of conjunctival specimens reveal increased number of mast cells, eosinophils, T lymphocytes and neutrophils in AKC patients.
Mast cells and eosinophils have not only been detected in conjunctival epithelium, but are also present in increased numbers in the substantia propria. A surplus of Langerhans cells, macrophages and B cells in the substantia propria is also seen.
T-lymphocyte infiltration is apparent in both conjunctival epithelium and substantia propria in AKC. T-helper (Th) cells predominate in all allergic eye diseases. Of the major T-cell subtypes, the Th1 subtype is involved in cellular immunity, whereas Th2 subtype is involved in humoral immune responses, including those mediated by IgE. Th2 cells are involved in eosinophil recruitment and stimulate IgE production from B cells. Th2 cytokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in AKC.
Activated eosinophils recruit additional inflammatory cells to the ocular surface. They release chemo-attractants which attract neutrophils to the conjunctiva. Eosinophils are also major players in the development of sight-threatening corneal complications in AKC.
Conjunctival Epithelial cells and Fibroblasts express pro-inflammatory mediators in VKC. The expression of surface adhesion molecules and the release of cytokines by epithelial cells enhance recruitment of eosinophils. Conjunctival fibroblasts, when activated by Th cytokines, promote local accumulation of eosinophils and enhance eosinophil degranulation.

Secondary structural changes:
Extensive inflammation in AKC leads to chronic ocular surface alterations:
-Goblet cell loss/hyperplasia: Both goblet cell loss (based on impression cytology), as well as goblet cell hyperplasia (based on conjunctival biopsy) have been reported. Goblet cell production of mucin is altered.
-Tear film instability: Tear film instability, with increased tear break-up time (BUT) but normal tear production, has also been described.
-Corneal sensation: Corneal sensations are reduced in AKC..
-Squamous metaplasia: Squamous metaplasia has also been described in patients with AKC.
Confocal microscopy studies:
AKC is associated with alterations in basal epithelium and sub-basal corneal nerves which relate to changes in tear function and corneal sensitivity. There is lower density of basal epithelial cells. A decrease in number and density of sub-basal long nerve fibers causes decreased corneal sensation. Corneal nerves are thickened and have bifurcation abnormalities. Inflammatory cells and activated keratocytes are found in the superficial stroma.
AKC should be differentiated from:
- Chronic allergic conjunctivitis (e.g. VKC).
- Blepharitis.
- Viral conjunctivitis.
- Trachoma.
- Cicatricial pemphigoid.

Similarities and differentiation from VKC:
Similarities:
- Potentially blinding chronic disease: AKC and VKC are chronic, potentially blinding conditions.
- Atopy: Both conditions present in individuals predisposed by an atopic background.
- Hypersensitivity responses: Both diseases involve both type I and type IV hypersensitivity responses. Eosinophils and T lymphocytes are found to infiltrate the conjunctiva in both conditions.
- Clinical features: Clinically, they are similar, with conjunctival inflammation, epithelial defects, shield ulcers, and corneal scarring as major features of both.
Differences:
- Age groups: AKC presents at an older age than VKC. VKC usually ‘burns out’ by late puberty, whereas AKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.
- Visual prognosis: Visual prognosis is worse for AKC.
- Peri-orbital skin and eyelid: There is increased peri-orbital and eyelid skin involvement in AKC as compared to VKC which generally spare skin.
- Papillae: AKC usually presents with micro-papillae on the palpebral conjunctiva. Lower tarsus is preferentially involved in AKC, in contrast to VKC, in which papillae are much more prominent on the upper tarsus. Giant papillae are sometimes seen in AKC, but this is a definitive hallmark of VKC.
- Eyelid margins: The eyelid margins are affected in AKC unlike VKC. Cicatricial changes, forniceal foreshortening, and symblepharon may be seen in AKC which are not usual in VKC.
- Trantas dots: Trantas dots are more frequently associated with VKC than AKC.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Because of chronic nature of AKC, the balance of treatment efficacy and risk is often difficult. AKC is generally less responsive and requires more intensive and prolonged treatment.
The approach to management is multifaceted with the purpose of improving patient comfort and preventing the complications associated with AKC. Management involves multiple treatment arms viz. topical mast cell stabilisers, corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents such as topical cyclosporine. In more severe cases, systemic immune-suppression may be required.

General measures:
-Environmental allergens: Control of environmental allergens may be helpful, but antigen avoidance is usually an adjunctive therapy.
-Eyelid hygiene: Because AKC involve the eyelids, in addition to the ocular surface, basic eyelid hygiene is essential. Eyelid scrubs should be part of daily routine in order to control blepharitis and the risk of staphylococcal keratitis. Antibiotic ointment may also be applied to the eyelid margins.
-Warm/cold compresses: Warm compresses improve tear film stability in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction related to eyelid margin inflammation.
    If severe itching or an exacerbation of peri-ocular atopic dermatitis is present, cold compresses will be more likely to provide symptomatic relief.

Medical therapy:
AKC is primarily managed medically. However, elective surgery may be of benefit where inflammation is well controlled.
The goal of therapy should be the complete control of ocular surface inflammation with the safest medicines and lowest dosing needed to achieve this.
Mast cell stabilisers and antihistamines are the mainstay of prophylactic therapy. Antihistamines, steroids and immune-suppressants are used for immediate management of symptoms.

Eyelids:
-Emollients: Emollients applied to the eyelid skin help control peri-ocular eczema.
-Steroid ointments: Mild steroid ointments also help in controlling peri-ocular eczema. As with eye-drops, the duration of treatment should be minimised and the intraocular pressure monitored.
-Immunosuppressive agent: Tacrolimus ointment, a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent, has also been shown to be effective in treating atopic dermatitis of the eyelids.

Ocular surface:
-Topical artificial tears: Superficial punctate keratopathy requires aggressive lubrication, with preservative-free artificial tears and lubricating ointments, with the goal of increasing comfort and avoiding frank epithelial defects, which are typically more difficult to manage in atopes.
-Topical antibiotic: If epithelial erosion does occur, topical antibiotic prophylaxis should be added to prevent bacterial super-infection and infectious keratitis, a complication of epithelial defects in AKC. All new epithelial defects should be cultured prior to initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
-Bandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens may be applied to facilitate healing of the corneal epithelial defect.
-Scleral contact lenses: In patients with corneal epithelial or stromal irregularity but with good control of their AKC, scleral contact lenses may afford good vision and increased comfort, thus avoiding surgery.
-Topical acetylcysteine: Acetylcysteine, a mucolytic agent, may be used topically for dissolving mucus filaments and deposits, and addressing early plaque formation.
-Topical antihistamines: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of AKC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. These are generally not for continuous long term use, and several preparations are used in courses of limited duration. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.Topical antihistamines when used in isolation are about as effective as mast cell stabilisers. They are suitable for acute exacerbations but generally not for continuous long term use, and courses of several preparations are used in courses of limited duration.
-Systemic antihistamines: Systemic antihistamines help itching, promote sleep and reduce nocturnal eye rubbing. Because other inflammatory mediators are involved besides histamines, effectiveness is not assured. Some antihistamines (e.g.loratadine) cause relatively little drowsiness.
-Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor) may offer relief in some cases.
-Topical mast cell stabilisers: Initial management of conjunctival inflammation may involve topical mast cell stabilisers. Topical mast cell stabilisers reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and the need for steroids and so form the basis of many regimens, but are seldom effective in isolation. Several days to weeks of treatment are needed for a reasonable response. The mast cell stabilisers include sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil, lodoxamide and pemirolast, which may be effective as maintenance therapy in mild cases of AKC.
-Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.
-Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs): Agents such as azelastine, epinastine, bepotastine, olopatadine and ketotifen have both mast cell-stabilising and anti-histamine properties, and are more frequently employed for allergic eye diseases. These agents have a relatively rapid onset of action.Although these agents have little direct effect on the T-cell mediated inflammation, they may reduce overall induction of inflammation and, importantly, reduce mechanical eye rubbing, associated with the development of keratoconus and possibly AKC-associated cataract.
-Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations like ketorolac and diclofenac may improve comfort by blocking non-histamine mediators. Combining one of these with a mast cell stabiliser is an effective regimen in some patients.
-Topical corticosteroid therapy: More severe inflammation in AKC usually requires topical corticosteroid therapy. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile. Since the inflammation in AKC is on the ocular surface, corticosteroids with significant intraocular penetration should be avoided when possible. Steroid-related side effects, such as cataract and elevated intraocular pressure are often inevitable for AKC patients. Superior tarsal injection of corticosteroids is effective in refractory cases, though this treatment option may also be limited by side effects.
-Topical immune-modulator drugs: Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs, such as topical cyclosporine, have immune-modulatory effect by reducing Th cells, B cells and macrophages after treatment. Side effects include intense stinging and prolonged blurred vision. Tacrolimus ointment also inhibits T-cell production with greater potency than cyclosporine.
-Systemic immune suppression: Advanced and refractory AKC may sometimes necessitate systemic immune-suppression, in order to prevent sight-threatening complications. Agents reported to be beneficial include prednisone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and azathioprine.
    The benefits of immune-suppressants, both systemic and local, must be balanced against the significant risk of infection, both bacterial and viral.
- Allergen desensitisation: Allergen desensitisation may be effective in some patients with high serum IgE levels.
-Plasmapheresis: Plasmapheresis may be done in some patients with high serum IgE levels.
Surgical therapy:
-Superficial keratectomy: Shield ulcer plaques, consisting of epithelial and inflammatory debris at the base of an ulcer, often are resistant to treatment with topical anti-inflammatory therapy. Superficial keratectomy may be required to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation. Medical treatment must be maintained until the cornea has re-epithelialised in order to prevent recurrences.
-Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy is an alternative to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation.
-Penetrating keratoplasty (full-thickness corneal transplant): Corneal scarring and occasionally perforation may occur in severe cases and necessitate penetrating keratoplasty.
-Papillary resection: Papillary resection with or without mitomycin-C (MMC) application has been described as a method to reduce ocular surface inflammation.
-Surface maintenance/restoration procedures: Surface maintenance/restoration procedures may be required for severe persistent epithelial defects or ulceration. Various procedures may be:
    1. Amniotic membrane overlay grafting.
    2. Lamellar keratoplasty (partial-thickness corneal transplant).
    3. Eyelid procedures such as botulinum toxin-induced ptosis or lateral tarsorrhaphy (surgical fusion of upper and lower eyelid margin to narrow the eyelid opening). 
    4. Gluing may be appropriate for focal (‘punched-out’) corneal perforations.
-Eyelid surgery: In advanced AKC, extensive scarring of the ocular surface and eyelid margins may necessitate eyelid surgery. This includes lid margin tightening and rotational procedures for lid mal-position, as well as symblepharon lysis and forniceal reconstruction for severe conjunctival scarring.
-Cataract surgery: Many patients will require cataract surgery at a relatively young age due to atopic and steroid-induced cataract development.
-Glaucoma surgery: A few patients may need glaucoma filtering surgery or valve placement if steroid-induced glaucoma develops.
-Stem cell transplantation: Patients who develop limbal stem cell deficiency may require ocular surface stem cell transplantation for visual rehabilitation.

Associated systemic conditions should be treated as well. Uncontrolled dermatitis with vision-threatening complications requires systemic steroids.
Any associated Herpes simplex keratitis should be treated with topical antiviral agents. Recurrent attacks of Herpes infection may require systemic antiviral also.

Prognosis:
AKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.
Proper prophylaxis, prompt treatment and planned surgical management can reduce the incidence of poor vision and blindness.
AKC is a potentially blinding disease. AKC may result in diminished vision or blindness from superficial punctate keratitis, persistent corneal epithelial defects, corneal scarring or thinning, cataract, keratoconus and symblepharon formation.
Patients should be observed frequently until the ocular surface disease is stable. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or immuno- suppressives, should have regular examination for drug-induced adverse effects. Corticosteroids promote the development of cataract, glaucoma and may lead to secondary corneal infections."
Avian influenza in humans,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/avian-influenza-in-humans,"Avian influenza (AI) is an infectious viral disease of birds, commonly known as bird flu. Wild water fowl such as ducks and geese are mostly affected by AI, but often show no apparent signs of illness. Poultry birds are also susceptible to AI infection that can cause large outbreaks and epidemics in poultry.
Humans are not usually affected by AI virus, however some subtypes of AI such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), have caused serious infections in people. Other avian influenza subtypes, including H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2, have also infected people.
Avian influenza A(H5N1) subtype virus is highly pathogenic virus. It was first recognized in humans in 1997 during the poultry outbreak in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China. Since its re-emergence in 2003, outbreaks of A (H5N1) have reported from poultry in Asia to Europe, and Africa. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 16 countries have reported 846 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, including 449 deaths since 2003 through 20 January 2016.Out of 16 countries, 4 were in South-East Asia Region; Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand.
10 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A (H5N6) virus including 6 deaths have been detected in China since 2013.
In March 2013, a subtype of influenza virus, A(H7N9) was detected first time in humans in China. A total of 722 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including at least 286 deaths , have been reported to WHO.
A total of 28 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses, with mild symptoms have been detected globally.
Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India has reported 25 episodes of AI A(H5N1) in poultry birds in 15 states/ union territory(Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal , Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, Sikkim, Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala, Chandigarh) till January 2015. First outbreak of H5N1 occurred in Maharashtra and Gujarat in February 2006. During 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were detected in crows in several states of India.
No case of avian influenza in humans is detected in India so far. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme working under National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi is keeping surveillance of avian influenza in India.
Infection of avian populations with certain subtypes of avian influenza A virus poses continuing global public health risks because of two reasons, first- occurrence of sporadic human infections and second- emergence of a pandemic influenza strain (disease occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population).
All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are reportable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005).","Signs and symptoms of Avian influenza A virus infections in humans-
In Infection caused by low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A virus, sign and symptoms ranged from conjunctivitis to influenza-like illness like fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches to lower respiratory disease (pneumonia) requiring hospitalization.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A virus infections in people have been associatedwith high grade fever (higher than 38oC) with influenza like symptoms as cough with sputum (sometimes bloody) and sore throat. Some patients may show symptoms of lower respiratory tract involvement early in the illness.
Some patients may suffer from diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums and sometime neurological changes (altered mental status, seizures).
Respiratory distress, a hoarse voice, and a crackling sound during inhalation are common findings.
Incubation period for A (H5N1) is ranging from two to eight days and may be as long as 17 days and for A(H7N9) it is between two to eight days, with an average of five days. WHO recommends that an incubation period of seven days can be used for field investigations and for the monitoring of patient contacts.
The case fatality rate for A (H5N1) and A(H7N9) virus infections in people is much higher as compared to seasonal influenza infections.","Disease is caused by avian influenza virus belongs to the Influenza A genus of the orthomyxoviridae family.
AI viruses are divided in to two groups according to severity of the disease: high pathogenic viruses and low pathogenic viruses.
High pathogenic viruses are responsible for high death rates (up to 100% mortality within 48 hours) in some poultry species. Low pathogenic viruses, which are not, associated with severe disease but cause outbreak in poultry species. 
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are mainly restricted to H5, and H7 subtypes which are in circulation in poultry. These viruses have potential to cause serious disease in people and have the potential to change into a form that is more transmissible among humans.
Transmission- Infected birds shed avian influenza virus in their saliva, mucous and faeces. Following direct close or prolonged contact with sick or dead infected poultry, viruses enter into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or are inhaled.
Risk factors for human infection-
Direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets are the primary risk factors for getting the infection.
Consumption of dishes made of raw, contaminated poultry blood can cause infection.
Slaughter, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are likely to be risk factors.
Properly prepared poultry or eggs usually do not transmit the disease.
Current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that AI virus is not transmitted human to human.","Diagnosis of Avian influenza is suspected in all persons presenting with acute febrile respiratory illness in those countries or territories where avian influenza A viruses have been identified in animal populations.
Presenting signs and symptoms of AI illness are non-specific therefore a detailed exposure history should be taken including any close/direct contact with sick or dead poultry, wild birds, other severely ill persons, travel to an area with AI activity, or work in laboratory handling samples possibly containing AI virus.
In India National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi are performing tests for diagnosis of AI in humansa.
National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh is an apex laboratory for testing AI in animals. Four bio-safety level lll (BSL lll) laboratories in Jalandhar, Kolkata, Bangalore, and Bareilly and a mobile BSL lll lab at Guwahati have been performing the test. Central/State diagnostic laboratories with bio-safety level II(BSL II) in 21 states are doing diagnosis for AI in animal populationb. 
(""Golden Rule:"" Clinical specimens from humans and from animals should never be processed in the same laboratory. However they could be processed in the same institution if separation of working rooms for animal and human specimens is clear and strict. This is to eliminate risk of cross contamination of human and animal samples. [WHO])
Avian influenza A virus infection is usually diagnosed by collecting a swab from the nose or throat of the sick person during the first few days of illness.
Following tests may be used to detect avian influenza in human samples-

Viral RNA detection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real time RT- PCR assay-PCR detects viral RNA present in either clinical specimens or virus cultures. RT-PCR assay takes six to eight hours whereas Real time RT-PCR methods provide results in three to four hours and are more sensitive.

Virus culture- Because of the bio-safety concern, isolation of highly pathogenic viruses is usually performed only in specially qualified and equipped laboratories.

Rapid antigen detection- Viral antigen detection may be carried out by immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) methods.

Serological identification of antibodies against avian influenza A viruses-Serological tests available for the measurement of influenza A-specific antibody include the haemagglutination inhibition test (HI), enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and virus neutralization tests (VN).","Hospital care is recommended in initial stages of the disease (such as Human infection with an A(H5N1) to monitor clinical status. After discharge from hospital appropriate instructions for household members on personal hygiene and infection control measures should be provided.
Along with supportive therapy some antiviral drugs, especially oseltamivir, can be used. It reduces the duration of viral replication and improves prospects of survival.
Antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) is given as early as possible based on clinical suspicion (ideally, within 48 hours following symptom onset) and before confirmation of causative agent. In suspected case a standard five day course should be given, unless any other diagnosis is confirmed. In a confirmed case depending on the clinical status, dose and duration of the oseltamivir therapy can be increased by treating clinician. The use of corticosteroids is not recommended by WHO."
Astigmatism,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/astigmatism,"Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in different meridian. As a result, the light rays entering the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines.
As described by Bannon and Walsh (1945), astigmatism was first mentioned in 1727 by Sir Issac Newton. But Thomas Young in 1800 published first description of astigmatism.
Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.
Emmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.
The term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.
Prevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers. Astigmatism change relatively little with age. The majority of children and young adults have a small amount of with-the-rule astigmatism, but in later adult years, there is a tendency for with-the-rule astigmatism to decrease in amount and for against-the-rule astigmatism to increase.
Astigmatism is divided as

Regular astigmatism: It is correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. It may be

- With-the-rule astigmatism: When the steepest corneal meridian is close to 90˚.
- Against-the-rule astigmatism: When the steepest meridian is close to 180˚.
- Oblique astigmatism: Principal meridians do not lie close to 90˚ or 180˚.
- Bi- oblique astigmatism: The two principal meridians are not at right angle to each other.

Irregular astigmatism: It is not correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. Patients with irregular astigmatism typically suffer from reduced visual acuity and poor quality of vision. Irregular astigmatism may result from corneal diseases, such as keratoconus, trauma or scarring following herpes infection. It may also be produced due to cataract surgery, penetrating keratoplasty or elective kerato-refractive surgery.

Depending on spherical ametropia of a particular eye, astigmatism may be classified as simple or compound based on whether one or both meridians, respectively, are focused outside the retina. If one meridian focuses in front of the retina and the other meridian focuses behind it, the astigmatism is called mixed astigmatism.
In astigmatism, the eye has different refractive powers along different meridians. Light entering in vertical direction gets focused differently than light in the horizontal direction. The meridian of steeper curvature has greater refractive power. The astigmatic eye produces a blurred image because two focal lines of images are being produced. This requires different corrections along each of these meridians to produce a single focused image on the retina.","Symptoms vary according to the degree and type of regular astigmatism and may include

Blurring of vision: Patients with low astigmatism show transient blurring of vision, which is relieved by closing or rubbing the eyes. Eyes become fatigued with reading and the letters are described as ‘running together’.
Symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain): Symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain) include tiredness of eyes, headache, irritability, dizziness and fatigue.
Narrowing of eyes: Narrowing of eyes may be resorted to in cases having high astigmatism to see clear. Narrowing produces a stenopaeic slit effect which cuts down the light rays in one meridian.
Head tilt: Some patients with high oblique astigmatism may keep the head tilted to one side to avoid distortion of image.
Holding books close to eyes: Many patients with high astigmatism may hold the books close to the eyes in a bid to achieve larger image.
Burning.
Itching.

Patients with irregular astigmatism present with

Defective vision.
Distorted vision.
Polyopia (seeing multiple images of a single object).","Astigmatism may be natural, traumatic following a wound or surgically induced as is seen following cataract surgery. Tight sutures after surgery further accentuate astigmatism.
I. Regular astigmatism may be

Corneal astigmatism: It is due to abnormalities in corneal curvature. This is the commonest type and is usually congenital. Acquired corneal astigmatism is not infrequent, but it often gives rise to irregular astigmatism.
Lenticular astigmatism: This is relatively less common. It may be of following types:

- Curvature astigmatism: Congenital abnormalities of lens curvature may produce small amount of curvature astigmatism. Marked lenticular astigmatism may be seen in condition like lenticonus.
- Positional astigmatism: Congenital tilting or oblique placement of lens may produce small amount of astigmatism. Congenital or traumatic subluxation of lens may also produce astigmatism of varying degrees.
- Index astigmatism: Variable degree of change in refractive index of crystalline lens of patients suffering from diabetes or nuclear sclerosis may occur.

Retinal astigmatism: Occasionally, obliquity of macula may produce retinal astigmatism.


Optics of regular astigmatism:
In regular astigmatism, the parallel rays of light are not focused at a point but form two focal lines. This configuration of refracted rays through astigmatic surface (or toric surface) is called Sturm’s conoid and the distance between two focal lines is called focal interval of Sturm. Length of focal interval is a measure of the degree of astigmatism.

II. Irregular astigmatism may be

Corneal irregular astigmatism: Extensive corneal scarring or ectatic conditions like keratoconus may produce this.
Lenticular irregular astigmatism: This may be produced due to variable refractive index in different parts of the crystalline lens and rarely may occur during maturation of cataract.
Retinal irregular astigmatism: It may be produced by distortion of the macular area due to scarring or tumours of retina and choroid pushing the macular area.","Diagnosis of astigmatism depends upon the symptoms and clinical features.
Refractive error may be determined by

Retinoscopy: Power in two different axes may be determined by retinoscopy.
Astigmatic fan test: Astigmatic fan test is a sensitive test to find out astigmatism.
Jackson cross- cylinder test: Jackson cross- cylinder test helps in confirming the power and axis of cylindrical lenses.
Keratometry: Keratometry reveals different corneal curvature in two separate meridians. Irregular astigmatism shows distorted keratometry.
Corneal topography: Corneal topography is essential in understanding the shape and curvature of cornea, and helps in establishing diagnosis. Irregular astigmatism patients show irregularities on corneal topography.
Very high frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound arc scanner: It is capable of obtaining 3- dimensional (3D) layered pachymetry across the central 10 mm of cornea. Resolution of scanner on cornea mode distinguishes individual corneal layers such as epithelium or stroma in all three dimensions, due to multi-meridional scanning.
Wavefront aberrometry: Wavefront aberrometry may help in diagnosis of irregular astigmatism and the assessment of the optical quality of the eye. Simulations of the retinal images are useful to understand some of the symptoms of irregular astigmatism. With corneal topographic analysis, the origin of irregular astigmatism from the cornea or internally, or both, may be specified by aberrometry. Clinical application of aberrometry is wavefront – guided refractive surgery.

Types of regular astigmatism:
Based upon the axis and the angle between two principal meridia, regular astigmatism may be classified into:

With-the-rule astigmatism: The two principal meridia are placed at right angle to one another with vertical meridian steeper or more curved than the horizontal one. This is called with-the-rule astigmatism, because similar astigmatic condition exists normally due to eyelid pressure on cornea.
Against-the-rule astigmatism: The two principal meridia are placed at right angle to one another with horizontal meridian steeper or more curved than the vertical one.
Oblique astigmatism: It is a type of regular astigmatism where two principal meridia, though placed at right angle, are not in vertical and horizontal meridian. Oblique astigmatism is often found to be symmetrical (e.g. cylindrical lens required at 30˚ in both eyes) or complementary (e.g. cylindrical lens required at 30˚ in one eye and at 150˚ in the other eye).
Bi-oblique astigmatism: In this type, the two principal meridia are not at right angle to each other.

Refractive types of regular astigmatism: Depending upon the position of two focal lines in relation to retina, regular astigmatism is classified into:

Simple astigmatism: The rays of light are focused in one meridian only on the retina. The rays of light in other meridian are focused in front or behind retina. Accordingly, it is called

- Simple myopic astigmatism: When the light rays of other meridian are focused in front of the retina.
- Simple hypermetropic astigmatism: When the light rays of other meridian are focused behind the retina.

Compound astigmatism: The rays of light are focused either in front or behind the retina in both the meridia. Accordingly, it is called

- Compound myopic astigmatism: The rays of light are focused in front of the retina in both the meridia.
- Compound hypermetropic astigmatism: The rays of light are focused behind the retina in both the meridia.

Mixed astigmatism: The rays of light are focused in front in one meridian and behind the retina in other meridian. Thus, eye is myopic in one meridian and it is hypermetropic in other. Such patients have relatively less symptoms as ‘circle of least diffusion’ forms on retina. It is presumed that a pencil of rays forms a minute circle of clear vision, called circle of least diffusion. Larger is the circle of least diffusion, poorer the vision.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical optical therapy: 
Optical therapy of regular astigmatism comprises of prescribing appropriate cylindrical lenses. The cylindrical lenses may be prescribed in the form of

Spectacles: Regular astigmatism may be corrected with spherocylindrical lenses except where the meridians are not perpendicular. Parallel rays falling upon a cylindrical lens are affected in different ways. In the direction of its axis, it is simply a plane lamina with parallel sides, so that it has no effect on the rays. In the direction at right angles to its axis, it is spherical on one side and plane on the other. Therefore, it acts like a planoconvex or a planoconcave.
Contact lenses.

Guidelines for optical correction:

Small astigmatism: Small astigmatism (about 0.5 dioptres or less) may be ignored and corrected only if there are symptoms of eye asthenopia or there is deterioration of vision.
High astigmatism: Cylindrical error should be corrected as full as possible. An under correction may be prescribed to begin with if the patient is not comfortable with full correction. In all cases in which astigmatism produces asthenopic symptoms, full optical correction should be prescribed for constant use i.e. for distance as well as for near.
Change in astigmatic correction: Change in astigmatic correction should preferably be avoided even if there is some improvement in visual acuity. Change in astigmatic correction may be given only if there is significant improvement in visual acuity and it may take some time to adjust.

Bi- oblique astigmatism, high astigmatism or mixed astigmatism is better treated by prescribing with contact lenses.
Patients with irregular astigmatism typically suffer from reduced visual acuity as well as visual quality. Pinhole occluders may provide some improvement in vision as compared to spectacles.
Optical therapy of irregular astigmatism consists of prescribing contact lenses which replaces the affected anterior corneal surface for refraction. An improvement in vision may be obtained using gas permeable lenses as compared to soft hydrogel lenses.

Surgical therapy:
Indications of surgery: Correction of astigmatism by surgery is done when it significantly affects vision. Typically, visually significant astigmatism is roughly more than 1 dioptres, although many patients may be symptomatic even with lower astigmatism. With improved surgical techniques such as excimer laser, even lower degree of astigmatism is being treated by surgical means. Usually surgery is done for

Irregular astigmatism.
Patients who wish to discard glasses or contact lenses.
Patients who are intolerant of glasses or contact lenses.
Development of visually significant astigmatism following ocular surgery.

Surgical therapy includes:

Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): Keratomileusis refers to carving of cornea. Astigmatism is corrected by combining central and peripheral treatments to differentially steepen the flattest corneal meridian and flatten the steepest meridian. Excimer laser ablation is applied directly to the corneal stroma after reflecting a lamellar or partial- thickness corneal flap. The flap is returned to its original position, once ablation is complete. Recovery of vision usually takes few days and some patients even take few weeks.
Wavefront- guided LASIK: Wavefront- guided LASIK or custom LASIK is a new wavefront technology to program ablation pattern more precisely than the conventional LASIK.
IntraLASIK (IntraLase): IntraLASIK uses femtosecond laser, which is more accurate than a blade and provides a huge margin in terms of precision and safety. Femtosecond laser creates a corneal flap at a pre-programmed depth and position.
EpiLASIK: EpiLASIK is designed to create a thin flap in the epithelium. It is an excellent alternative for patients with thin and steep or flat cornea. The layer is preserved and later replaced following reshaping of cornea using excimer laser.
Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK): PRK also uses excimer laser to reshape cornea, but this procedure does not require lamellar flap. The laser is applied directly to the anterior stromal surface after removal of surface epithelium. A soft contact lens is prescribed after laser treatment. The corneal epithelium typically heals in about 4 to 7 days. Improvement of vision may take few weeks to several months.
Laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK): It involves cleaving the epithelial sheet at the basement membrane with dilute alcohol, applying laser as in conventional PRK, and repositioning the epithelium afterward.
Photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK): Photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) has been used to reduce astigmatism.
Radial keratotomy (RK): Earlier RK as keratorefractive surgery was used, that effectively reduced astigmatism. In RK, spoke- like cuts radiating from central cornea at about 90% corneal depth were given to balloon the peripheral cornea. Although RK surgery was effective, the results were often unpredictable and led to overcorrection, with progressive hypermetropia. RK surgery was soon replaced by laser vision correction with the introduction of PRK.
Astigmatic keratotomy (AK): Astigmatic keratotomy is a modification of RK surgery and is used to reduce corneal astigmatism. The two forms of corneal incisions, astigmatic keratotomy and limbal relaxing incisions (LRI), or more accurately peripheral corneal relaxing incisions (PCRI), are differentiated by their location on cornea. In both procedures, incisions are made to about 90% depth in cornea to flatten the steep meridian. PCRIs are easier to perform and have a weaker effect in correction because of their more peripheral location. Relaxing incisions, especially arcuate ones (arcuate keratotomy), are one of the commonly performed procedures for reduction of astigmatism. Femtosecond laser- enabled keratotomy has become an alternative to the mechanical techniques because of higher precision of incisions with improved accuracy and safety.
Refractive lens exchange (RLE): Refractive lens exchange (RLE) is a surgical procedure that may correct refractive error by removing and replacing the clear crystalline lens of the eye with toric intraocular lenses (toric IOLs). RLE is an option for high refractive errors, where laser vision correction is not an option.
Phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) implant: Toric phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) may be implanted in front of and attached to the iris or is placed just behind the iris. Toric phakic IOL is an alternative to laser vision correction with keratorefractive surgery. Unlike RLE, all eye structures including crystalline lens, is not touched when a toric phakic IOL is implanted.
Penetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty may be required in patients with affected cornea producing irregular astigmatism.

Contraindications to surgery:

Corneal or anterior segment diseases such as keratitis, conjunctivitis or corneal ulcers."
Aphakia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/aphakia,"Aphakia is a condition in which crystalline lens of the eye is not present in its normal position of pupillary area. Either there is no crystalline lens inside the eye or the lens is subluxated or luxated. This induces a refractive state which is not a refractive error in true sense. An emmetropic (normal refraction) eye or one having low grade ametropia (refractive error) becomes extremely hypermetropic after cataract surgery. A previously emmetropic eye requires a correction of about 10 to 11 dioptres (D) in spectacle when worn in the usual position.
Replacement of the crystalline lens with a spectacle lens causes the image on patient’s retina to be roughly 25% larger than the image formed with the crystalline lens. The exact magnification is determined by the power of the aphakic spectacles. There is about 2 % of magnification for each dioptre of power in the spectacles.
Aphakia comes from two Greek words (a means none and phacos means lens). It refers to both an anatomical and an optical condition.
Von Helmholtz (1855) worked on the optics of aphakia. Benito Daza De Valdes (1623) suggested that aphakia may be corrected with spectacles.","Aphakia causes symptoms such as

Diminution of uncorrected vision.
Inability to focus (due to loss of accommodation caused by aphakia).","Causes of aphakia are

Surgical aphakia: Surgical aphakia is the commonest type and is produced after removal of the crystalline lens.
Congenital absence of lens: There may be congenital absence of lens. It is a rare condition.
Absorption of lens matter: Rarely, absorption of lens matter may be seen after trauma in children.
Traumatic extrusion of lens: Rarely, there may be traumatic extrusion of lens from the eye leading to aphakia.
Posterior dislocation of lens: Posterior dislocation of lens in to the vitreous may cause optical aphakia.
Heritable disorders associated with dislocated lenses: These may be

- Marfan’s syndrome.
- Weil-Marchesani syndrome.
- Homocystinuria.
- Sulphite oxidase deficiency.

Heritable disorders reported with subluxated lenses: These include

- Aniridia.
- Ehlers- Danlos syndrome.
- Craniofacial dysostosis.
- Alport’s syndrome.
- Megalocornea.

Ocular diseases which may lead to subluxated lenses: It includes

- Hypermature cataract.
- Buphthalmos.
- Exfoliation syndrome of lens.
- Intraocular tumours.


Optics of aphakia:

Optical changes: Optical changes seen after removal of crystalline lens are

- The eye is highly hypermetropic with total power of about 44 D (power of eye with crystalline lens is about 60 D).
- The anterior and posterior focal points are about 23 mm and 31 mm, respectively.
- The two principal points are close to each other near anterior surface of cornea.

Image formation: The size of image varies in spectacle- corrected aphakia and contact lens- corrected aphakia.

- Spectacle- corrected aphakia: There is magnification of about 25 % with aphakic spectacle correction.
- Contact lens- corrected aphakia: There is less magnification (6-8%) as compared to spectacle correction.

Visual acuity: Visual acuity in spectacle- corrected aphakia seems better due to large size of the image. The recorded vision is theoretically better than the actual visual acuity.
Binocular vision: Aniseikonia (unequal size of retinal image) less than 5 %, is compatible with binocular vision. Aniseikonia is harmful to the development of normal binocular function.
Diplopia (double vision): Adult patients who have normal vision in un-operated eye find it difficult to attain binocular single vision and may suffer with diplopia.
Suppression amblyopia: Monocular aphakic children usually develop suppression amblyopia. It may lead to deviation of the operated eye.
Accommodation: Absence of crystalline lens leads to total loss of accommodation. Therefore, a patient needs bifocal, progressive or separate pair of glasses.","Diagnosis depends upon the symptoms and signs of aphakia.
Signs of aphakia:

Retinoscopy: Retinoscopy shows high hypermetropia.
Purkinje’s image: There are only two Purkinje’s images coming from the cornea. Images from the lens surface are missing.
Scar at limbus: Surgical aphakia may show scar at the limbus.
Anterior chamber: Anterior chamber is deep due to absence of lens from the eye.
Pupil: The pupil appears jet black in the absence of lens.
Iridodonesis: Iridodonesis or tremulousness of iris is present due to lack of support being provided by the lens.
Fundus: Examination shows hypermetropic fundus and the optic disc appears small.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical optical therapy:
Optical therapy of aphakia comprises of prescribing appropriate convex lenses. The convex lenses may be prescribed in the form of

Spectacles: Usually about + 10 D of correction with appropriate cylindrical power for surgically induced astigmatism is prescribed to correct aphakia in previously emmetropic eye. Exact power of glasses required differs in individual cases. Further addition of plus power is required for presbyopia (near vision) to compensate for loss of accommodation. Aphakic spectacles may have glasses in various forms such as aspherical, lenticular or full field lenses. Spectacles causes

- Magnification of image: The size of the image is magnified by about 25 %. Spectacles produce diplopia in cases of unilateral aphakia. The larger image of an object is interpreted to be closer to the eye. It requires efforts to coordinate between eyes and hand due to magnification. It produces difficulty in climbing stairs as well.
- Prismatic aberrations: It produces roving ring scotoma, usually described as Jack-in-the-box phenomenon. The prismatic effect is produced by the peripheral part of the correcting lens. It produces a ring scotoma. When patient sees an object and turns the eye towards it, the scotoma may shift inwards to occlude the object. On shifting the eye from the object, the scotoma shifts again and the object becomes visible.
- Spherical aberrations: When the objects are viewed through the periphery, the objects look enlarged, proximal, and elongated in radial direction. Pin-cushion effect produces distortion and it is the property of all plus lenses proportional to their diopteric power. This distortion makes a square look like a pincushion- the corners of the square have a stretched out appearance, and the sides are pushed in. The world becomes parabolic which continuously change its shape with eye movement. The objects appear to move faster. Driving a motor vehicle thus becomes very difficult.
- Field of vision: Monocular as well as binocular field of vision is markedly reduced. The actual field of view through the spectacles is reduced by 25 %, which makes it impossible to see that much of peripheral field.
- Coloured vision: There may be coloured hue in the vision. It occurs due to absence of natural filter of a crystalline lens. Removal of the crystalline lens increases blue and ultraviolet transmission of light.
- Thick glasses: The glasses are very thick and heavy. Bifocal glasses are especially difficult to adjust with and may require separate pair.

Contact lenses: Correction of aphakia at the corneal plane requires use of contact lenses. As the position at which the optical correction is made moves closer to retina, the necessary diopteric power increases but the subsequent magnification decreases. A patient who needs 12.5 D in aphakic spectacles would need about 14.7 D in a soft rigid contact lens. At the corneal plane the magnification is 6- 8%. Since the value is near the limit of aniseikonia, most unilateral aphakia patients can have binocular vision. Contact lenses have certain advantages over the glasses such as

- Provides wider and better field of vision.
- There is less magnification of the image since the contact lenses are close to the cornea.
- More suited for uniocular aphakia.
- It eliminates spherical aberration and prismatic effect.
- It is cosmetically more acceptable.

However, there may be lack of dexterity in older patients and intolerance owing to a foreign body sensation.

Surgical therapy:
Surgical therapy includes

Intraocular lens (IOL) implantation: IOL implantation is the best method of correcting aphakia. Calculation of power of an IOL depends upon keratometry (measured with keratometer) of the cornea and axial length of the eyeball (measured with ultrasonography). A patient who needs 12.5 D in apahkic spectacles would need about 21 D of an IOL in posterior chamber of eye. The average magnification due to an IOL in posterior chamber is about 1.5%, compared with the original crystalline lens. Almost everyone can achieve binocular vision with one eye pseudophakia and other phakic. An IOL may be implanted at the time of cataract surgery or as secondary implantation at a later date. Advantages of IOL includes

- Minimal after- care of patients.
- Rapid return of binocular vision.
- Minimal aniseikonia (different image size seen by the eyes).
- Normal peripheral vision.

Refractive corneal surgery: Corneal onlays, such as epikeratophakia and inlays, such as keratophakia are not used commonly in clinical settings. The optical effects are no different from those of contact lens, but onlays and inlays have the advantage that the patient does not need maintenance. Excellent success of contact lenses and IOLs mean that surgical techniques to correct aphakia at the cornea are not reasonable clinical alternatives. The procedures include

- Keratophakia: A lenticule obtained from donor cornea is placed in between the lamellar layers of the cornea of the patient.
- Epikeraophakia: A lenticule obtained from donor cornea is stitched over the surface of cornea after removing the epithelium. Epikeraophakia has the advantage that it may be done in patients where, because of age or ocular condition, a secondary or even primary IOL is not feasible. Since the eyeball is not entered, many complications can be avoided. Also, this procedure may be repeated.
- Hypermetropic Laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK).

Prognosis:
Prognosis for aphakia is generally good, unless there are complications like corneal oedema, cystoid macular oedema or secondary glaucoma.
However, aphakia increases the risk of retinal detachment, especially in high myopes and if the posterior capsule is ruptured."
Anisometropia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/anisometropia,"Anisometropia is an optical state with unequal refraction of the two eyes. The amount of spherical refractive error (myopia or hypermetropia) is usually about the same for both the eyes in most of the people. Generally, anisometropia is considered to exist if the refraction differs by 1.0 dioptres (D) or more for the two eyes. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Anisometropia is the most insidious refractive condition because it is often asymptomatic. The term antimetropia is used when one eye is myopic and the other is hypermetropic.
The word anisometropia is derived from the Greek words anisos (unequal), metron (measure), and ops (vision).
Emmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays.
The term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near-sightedness), hypermetropia (far-sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).
Anisometropia due to refractive myopia or hypermetropia is known as refractive anisometropia and that due to axial ametropia is known as axial anisometropia. Anisometropia due to difference in refractive error along one meridian only is called meridional anisometropia.
In myopic anisometropia, one expects the distance visual acuity in each eye to be lower than normal, the more myopic eye having the poorer visual acuity. However, when the amount of myopia in the less myopic eye is small (minus 0.25 or 0.50 D), the visual acuity in that eye is sufficiently good so that the patient may not be aware of the problem, even if the visual acuity in the more myopic eye is quite poor.
In hypermetropic anisometropia, the visual acuity of both eyes is relatively good as long as the patient has sufficient accommodation. 
In myopic anisometropia, hypermetropic anisometropia and antimetropia, the individual may not have complaint of asthenopia (eyestrain) and the anisometropia may be discovered during routine eye examination only. However, some cases of hypermetropic anisometropia may have asthenopia due to their inability to focus simultaneously.
Because both the eyes accommodate equally, an uncorrected anisometrope has the problem of never having sharply focused image on both retinas at the same time. For example, a person with 0.25 D of myopia in one eye and 3 D of myopia in other eye will have a sharp focus for one eye for objects at a distance of 4 meters and a sharp focus for the other eye for objects at a distance of 33 cm. Due to this, the person uses less myopic eye for distance vision and the more myopic eye for near vision. Although stereopsis (binocular depth perception) is poor, such individuals have an advantage in later years because bifocal reading glasses may not be required.
On the other hand, a person having 0.25 D of hypermetropia in one eye and 3 D of hypermetropia in the other eye has more severe difficulty. The less hypermetropic eye is used for distance vision requiring 0.25 D of accommodation only. However, more hypermetropic eye requires 3 D of accommodation for distance and 5.50 D of accommodation for a reading distance of 40 cm. Therefore, less hypermetropic eye never has a sharply focused image. It may lead to anisometropic amblyopia (non correctable visual acuity without an obvious cause) in early life.","Anisometropia occurs because of uncorrected unequal refractive error between fellow eyes. Uncorrected anisometropia produces

Accommodative asthenopia.
Alternating vision.
Blurring of image in one eye.
Abnormal binocular interaction produced by dissimilar images on retina.
Diplopia (double vision).
Amblyopia (inability to see image from one eye).
Strabismus (squint).","Anisometropia may be congenital or acquired.

Congenital and developmental anisometropia: This is produced due to differential growth of each eyeball. It is hereditary in origin.
Acquired anisometropia: This is produced by

- Post cataract surgery uniocular aphakia.
- Incorrect power of intraocular lens implant in patients of pseudophakia .
- Eye injury.
- Inadvertent surgical treatment of refractive error.
- Keratoplasty in one eye.","Diagnosis depends upon retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity.
Clinical types of Anisometropia:
Anisometropia may be absolute or relative.
I. Absolute anisometropia: In this condition, refractive power of the two eyes is not equal.
This is further divided into

Simple anisometropia: In this type one eye is normal and the other eye is hypermetropic or myopic.
Compound anisometropia: In this both eyes are ametropic i.e. either myopic or hypermetropic.
Mixed anisometropia: In this both eyes are ametropic with one being myopic and the other being hypermetropic. This is also called antimetropia.
Simple astigmatic anisometropia: In this type one eye is emmetropic and the other has simple astigmatism either myopic or hypermetropic.
Compound astigmatic anisometropia: Both eyes are astigmatic with unequal degree.

II. Relative anisometropia: It is that refractive anomaly in which although the total refraction of the two eyes is nearly equal, the component elements in each show relatively large differences. Therefore, total refraction of the two eyes may be equal, but the axial length may be different. This produces clear retinal image with aniseikonia (different size of retinal images).
Visual status in anisometropia: 
There are various visual possibilities

Binocular single vision: Binocular vision is possible in small degrees of anisometropia. A difference of more than 5 D between two eyes causes loss of binocularity. Since accommodation is distributed equally between two eyes and is not dissociated, the image of one eye is blurred always. It produces symptoms of accommodative asthenopia.
Amblyopia: If visual acuity is not good and the hypermetropia is high, then this eye may be excluded from vision and the eye develops amblyopia. Thus these patients have uniocular vision in the unaffected eye.
Alternating vision: When there is high anisometropia with good visual acuity in eyes, then the patient develops habit of using hypermetropic eye for distance and the myopic eye for near vision. These patients are usually comfortable and do not seek any medical help for vision correction.
Strabismus: The eye with the visual defect become convergent and the child may develop concomitant convergent squint.

Tests for binocular vision:
Binocular vision may be assessed by using FRIEND test or Worth’s four-dot test.
I. FRIEND test: In this test, alternate letters are green and red in colour. Letters F, I and N are in green colour and the letters R, E and D are in red colour. This is available in Snellen’s distance vision chart. Patient is seated 6 meters from the Snellen’s chart and wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient then reads letters FRIEND on Snellen’s chart. Result is interpreted as

Patient reads all letters as FRIEND: In the presence of binocular single vision, the patient reads all letters as FRIEND at once.
Patient reads either green FIN letters or red RED letters: In amblyopia or uniocular vision, patient reads either green letters or red letters i.e. it is read persistently either as FIN (read with left eye) or RED (read with right eye).
Patient reads sometimes FIN and RED: In alternate vision, patient reads sometimes FIN and RED at other times.

II. Worth’s four-dot test: Patient wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient views Snellen’s distance vision chart having four dots of light viz. one red, two green and one white. The results are interpreted as

Patient sees all the four lights: When all the four lights are seen in the absence of manifest squint, patient has normal binocular single vision. Patient sees four lights also in the presence of a manifest squint with abnormal retinal correspondence.
Patient sees two red lights only: This indicates suppression of vision in the left eye.
Patient sees three green lights only: This indicates suppression of vision in the right eye.
Patient sees three green lights and two red lights alternately: This indicates presence of alternating suppression of vision.
Patient sees three green lights and two red lights (five lights): This indicates the presence of diplopia in patient.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical therapy
Principal factors which influence optical correction of anisometropia are aniseikonia and amblyopia. Corrective guidelines are

Anisometropia should be fully corrected in the presence of amblyopia.
Anisometropia of 3 D or more at one year of age should be corrected as it may produce amblyopia in 60% of cases.
Degree of anisometropia between 1.50 D to 3 D that do not decline on follow-up should also be corrected.
Older children and adults may not be able to tolerate full correction binocularly. Therefore, reduced optical correction of the more ametropic eye may be required even with compromised visual acuity.
Large differences in refraction may require contact lenses, and are prescribed if

- Aniseikonia is present. Contact lenses reduce the difference in the size of the image e. g. as in aphakia. Binocular single vision may be restored in favourable cases.
- There is no improvement of visual acuity in anisometropic amblyopia in children with a difference in refraction of 4 D or above.
- Trial contact lenses show a better binocular function as compared to spectacles.

Patients with marked anisometropic myopia may show hypophoria in primary position with a head tilt to the side of more myopic eye to maintain a comfortable binocular single vision (the ‘heavy eye’ phenomenon).


Medical therapy includes

Spectacles: The corrective glasses may be tolerated up to a maximum difference of 4 D in two eyes. A difference more than 4 D produces diplopia. In children younger than 12 years of age, where best visual correction is required in both the eyes, contact lenses are preferred. In adults, best correction may be prescribed which does not result in ocular discomfort.
Contact lenses: Contact lenses are advised for higher degrees of anisometropia. These are more useful in young children with high anisometropia, who may become amblyopic in more ametropic eye.


Surgical therapy
This is the preferred mode of treatment.
Surgical therapy includes

Intraocular lens implantation: Intraocular lens may be implanted for uniocular aphakia.
Refractive corneal surgery: Refractive corneal surgery (refractive laser) may be done for unilateral myopia, astigmatism and hypermetropia. Photorefractive surgery, both photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), is being used increasingly to correct anisometropia.
Removal of crystalline lens: Crystalline lens may be removed for unilateral high myopia.
Phakic IOL: Intraocular lens may be implanted without removing the crystalline lens.
Clear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL: Clear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL, preferably foldable IOL or a piggyback IOL, may be done. Piggyback IOL means two IOLs are placed in the eye, one on top of the other. This is done if the biometry is +40 D and one does not have a lens of that power to implant."
Aniseikonia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/aniseikonia,"Aniseikonia is defined as a difference in the shape and/or size of images presented to the visual cortex by two eyes. The brain is unable to fuse two images, resulting in an extra ghost image or diplopia. Aniseikonia is often produced due to significant amount of anisometropia, especially when it is corrected by spectacles instead of contact lenses. It is difficult to detect aniseikonia based on history and clinical examination. Aniseikonia precludes fusion of images when the degree is large. Despite this, it is rare that a patient volunteer a difference in image size and/or shape between the two eyes. Aniseikonia is usually considered clinically significant when the image size difference is greater than 4 percent, but many patients experience distortions in spatial perception and/or uncomfortable binocular vision with differences as small as 2 percent.
The term ‘aniseikonia’ was introduced by Lancaster in 1938 to refer to a difference between two eyes in the perceived size of an object. The word aniseikonia originates from the Greek words aniso (unequal) and eikon (image).
Emmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays.
The term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near-sightedness), hypermetropia (far-sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).
Optical aniseikonia denotes aniseikonia due to a physically measured difference in the sizes of the retinal images that typically arises in uncorrected axial anisometropia or in corrected refractive anisometropia. Little if any difference in the size of the image occurs with corrected axial anisometropia or with uncorrected refractive anisometropia. Aniseikonia may occur in people for whom the images in the two eyes are equal in size, in which case it must be due to non-optical causes. This condition is referred as neural aniseikonia.
Aniseikonia is the cause of curable ocular discomfort suffered by small but not insignificant number of people.
Most commonly aniseikonia occur following eye surgery. An eye with significant refractive error as in aphakia (when operated for cataract) or refractive surgery, the refractive error is minimised in operated eye. But the other eye still requires a strong corrective lens for clear vision. Similarly, when both eyes are operated for cataract surgery but intraocular lens (IOL) with wrong power (pseudophakia) is used in one or both eyes, also produces aniseikonia.","Tolerance for the disease varies amongst individual patient. Some patients apparently are able to tolerate rather large aniseikonia and others suffer severe symptoms with even smaller degree. It is when difference in size of the image or meridional distortions approaches tolerance levels that the symptoms manifest. Meridional distortions are poorly tolerated, especially when they are oblique.
When the variation in magnification or meridional distortion between two eyes is disproportionately high, it may produce symptoms such as

Headache.
Asthenopia (eye strain).
Ocular discomfort or fatigue.
Blurring of vision.
Difficulty in reading.
Photophobia.
Disturbances in binocular vision.
Amblyopia in children at an early stage of life.
Diplopia.
Disorientation.
Disturbance in depth perception.
Dizziness.","Aniseikonia may occur naturally or is produced secondary to correction of refractive error. Up to 7% of aniseikonia between two eyes is usually tolerated well, and it corresponds to about 3 dioptres (D) of anisometropia. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.
Causes includes
I. Optical

Inherent: This is due to defect in the diopteric system of the eye and is usually related to anisometropia.
Acquired: This is determined by the correcting lenses and it depends upon the lenses worn, their power, position, thickness and form.


II. Anatomical or retinal

Displacement of retinal elements: Displacement of retinal elements towards nodal point in one eye.
Separation of neuroepithelial elements: Separation of neuroepithelial elements of retina may produce aniseikonia.
Streching of retina.
Retinal oedema.

Retinal factors may cause light projected on the retina by a perceived image to appear larger (macropsia) or smaller (micropsia), since variable number of photoreceptors are stimulated. Causes of retinal aniseikonia include retinal tears, detachment, macular hole, retinoschisis, epiretinal membranes or macular oedema.
III. Central or cortical

Asymmetrical simultaneous perception by cerebral cortex: The asymmetrical simultaneous perception in spite of equal size of images formed on the retina leads to aniseikonia.","Diagnosis depends upon clinical symptoms and retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity.
Clinical aniseikonia may be defined as the amount of aniseikonia that is necessary to correct to eliminate symptoms. It usually occurs when the difference in image size between two eyes approaches 0.75%. The oblique meridional aniseikonia causes a rotational deviation between the fused images of vertical lines in two eyes. This is termed as declination. Declination becomes clinically significant when it approaches 0.3˚.
Clinical types of aniseikonia
Aniseikonia may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical.
Symmetrical aniseikonia
In symmetrical aniseikonia, one image is larger than the other, either in all dimensions or in one meridian only. This difference in meridian may be oblique.

Overall aniseikonia: In this type, the size of one ocular image is symmetrically different than the other image. The image may be magnified or minified symmetrically in both meridia.
Meridional or cylindrical aniseikonia: Here the size of retinal image of one eye is symmetrically larger or smaller than that of other in one meridian only. The involved meridian may be vertical, horizontal or oblique.
Compound aniseikonia: There is combination of overall and meridional differences.


Asymmetrical aniseikonia
In asymmetrical aniseikonia, the image is distorted in some degree. This may be

Prismatic type: In this type, image difference increases progressively in one direction.
Pincushion type: In this type, there is progressive increase in all directions from the visual axis, as is seen with high plus correction in aphakia.
Barrel type: In this type, image distortion decreases progressively in both directions, as is seen in correction with high minus lenses.
Oblique type: In this type, the size of image is same, but there occurs an oblique distortion of shape.


Tests for aniseikonia:
An eikonometer is an instrument used to detect and measure aniseikonia. There are two basic types of eikonometer, the direct eikonometer and the space eikonometer.

Direct comparison eikonometer: Direct comparison eikonometer presents dichoptic (separate and independent field by each eye) stimuli simultaneously in a stereoscope. The stimuli may be two identical patterns which appear side by side or they may be concentric displays. The difference in size of the two images that appear equal in size indicates the magnitude of anisikonia.
Space eikonometer: Space eikonometer involves the psychophysical determination of distortions in stereoscopic vision induced by aniseikonia. This method can be used only in subjects with stereoscopic vision.

Clinically, a simple printed direct comparison aniseikonia test and a computerised test is available to analyse aniseikonia.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.

Asbestos-related diseases,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/asbestos-related-diseases,"Asbestos-related diseases 
Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring fibrous minerals which are commercially used for insulation in buildings and as an ingredient in a number of products such as roofing tiles, water supply lines, and fire blankets, as well as clutches and brake linings, gaskets, and pads for automobiles. Asbestos causes cancer and chronic respiratory diseases in humans.
All forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite) are in use because of their extraordinary tensile strength, poor heat conduction, and relative resistance to chemical attack. Chemically, asbestos minerals are silicate compounds, meaning they contain atoms of silicon and oxygen in their molecular structure.
All forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to asbestos (including chrysotile) causes cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovaries, and also mesothelioma (a cancer of the pleural and peritoneal linings). Asbestos exposure is also responsible for other diseases such as asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), and plaques, thickening and effusion in the pleura.
Exposure to asbestos occurs through inhalation of fibers in air in the working environment, ambient air in the vicinity of point sources such as factories handling asbestos, or indoor air in housing and buildings containing friable asbestos materials.
According to World Health Organization estimates about 125 million people in the world are exposed to asbestos at the workplace. At least 107000 people die each year from asbestos-related lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis resulting from occupational exposures. Approximately half of the deaths from occupational cancer are estimated to be caused by asbestos. In addition, it is estimated that several thousand deaths annually can be attributed to exposure to asbestos in the home.
It has also been shown that co-exposure to tobacco smoke and asbestos fibers substantially increases the risk for lung cancer and the heavier the smoking, the greater the risk.
Asbestos is still widely used in Asian countries. Asbestos deposits are found in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Rajasthan. In India, the domestic consumption of asbestos is 1.25 lakh tones annually, out of which more than a 1.0 lakh tonnes is being imported. Significant occupational exposure to asbestos occurs mainly in asbestos cement factories, asbestos textile industry and asbestos mining and milling. National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH), Ahmedabad, has carried out environmental and epidemiological studies in cement factories, asbestos textile industry and asbestos mining and milling with the following observations-

The prevalence of asbestosis in four cement factories (Ahmadabad, Hyderabad, Coimbatore and Mumbai) varied from 3% to 5%.
In asbestos textile industry prevalence of asbestosis was 9% in workers having less than 10 years exposure, in contrast to the reported average duration of over 20 years. Exposure to asbestos fibers is quite high in these industries (216-418 fibers/ml as compare to permissible limit of 2 fibers /ml).
The overall prevalence of asbestosis in mining and milling units was 3% and 21% respectively. In asbestos mines at two locations, the air borne fiber levels were within permissible limits. The average fiber levels in milling units were between 45 fibers/ml -244 fibers/ml.

The burden of asbestos-related diseases is still rising, even in countries that banned the use of asbestos in the early 1990s. Because of the long latency periods attached to the asbestos related diseases, stopping the use of asbestos now will result in a decrease in the number of asbestos-related deaths only after a number of decades. There is no safe use of asbestos and no safe limits set by WHO, ILO (International labour organization).","Repeated or prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibers may cause asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), pleural plaques, thickening and pleural effusion. Individuals who have been exposed (or suspect they have been exposed) to asbestos fibers on the job, through the environment, or at home via a family contact should consult their doctor whether or not they experience any symptoms. The symptoms of asbestos-related diseases may be apparent after many decades, such as;

Shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness.
Persistence of cough gets worse over time.
Blood in sputum.
Pain or tightening in the chest.
Difficulty swallowing.
Swelling of the neck or face.
Loss of appetite.
Weight loss.
Fatigue and anemia.

The disease is progressive even after removal of the worker from the contact. In advanced cases there may be clubbing of finger nails, distress, and cyanosis.","There are six types of asbestos minerals (chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite).All commercial forms of asbestos are carcinogenic.
Exposure to asbestos mostly occurs through inhalation of fibers primarily from contaminated air in the working environment, or from ambient air in the vicinity of point sources or indoor air in housing and buildings containing friable asbestos materials. Friable asbestos materials continue to give rise to exposure during maintenance, alteration, removal and demolition. Exposure can also occur as a consequence of natural disasters causing damage to buildings.
Asbestos can enter both in ground and surface water from natural and anthropogenic (changes in nature by people) sources. Soil can also contain asbestos through natural and anthropogenic (disposal of asbestos containing wastes in landfill) sources.
Occupational exposure -The highest levels of exposure occur during repackaging of asbestos containers, mixing with other raw materials and dry cutting of asbestos-containing products with abrasive tools. Exposure can also occur during installation and use of asbestos-containing products and maintenance of vehicles.
Exposure of the general population- Inhalation and ingestion are the primary routes of exposure to asbestos. Inhalation of asbestos fibers from outdoor air and to a lesser degree in indoor air is the primary route of exposure for the non- smoking general population (white collar workers within the asbestos industry, individuals living in the vicinity of asbestos mines). Exposure may also occur via ingestion of drinking water which has been contaminated with the asbestos.
Families of asbestos workers may be exposed via contact with fibers carried home on hair or on clothing. Asbestos related diseases have been reported in wives and children of asbestos workers, as a result of domestic exposure.
Construction activities and inadvertent exposure of the wider population from degradation of building materials (e.g. broken corrugated asbestos roof tiles) and inappropriate disposal of building waste also expose to general population to asbestos.
Elevated concentrations of asbestos fibers in ambient air were observed at busy traffic intersections from friction products in vehicles.
Factors affecting the risk of developing asbestos–related diseases-

Dose( how much asbestos an individual was exposed to)
Duration (how long an individual was exposed)
Size, shape, and chemical composition of asbestos fibers
Source of the exposure
Individual risk factors such as smoking and pre-existing lung disease","A thorough physical examination is recommended with the following tests-

Lung function test shows reduced vital capacity and expiratory volume.
Sputum examination- Sputum shows asbestos bodies (which are asbestos fibers coated with fibrin).
Chest X-ray- An X-ray of chest shows a ground –glass appearance in the lower two thirds of the lung fields.
Ultrasonography of lungs is useful in characterizing pleural effusions and evaluating pleural thickening or masses.
Computed tomography of lungs.
Bronchoscopy.
Lung biopsy.","No specific therapy is recommended for asbestos related diseases.
Smoking cessation, withdrawal from further exposure is advised.
Treatment of asbestos –related disease includes vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia, antimicrobial therapy for respiratory infections and the use of oxygen if necessary.
Surveillance for lung cancer and mesothelioma should be done. 
A multidisciplinary approach focused on supportive care; multimodality treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy may be considered in cancer cases."
Amblyopia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/amblyopia,"Amblyopia is often defined as a difference in visual acuity of two lines or more on Snellen or equivalent chart in a child with, otherwise, healthy eyes. Amblyopia may be present any time visual acuity is reduced, and the reduction of acuity cannot be explained by findings on clinical examination, even if the difference is even one line only.
The term amblyopia is derived from Greek word (amblys means dull and ops means eye), which literally means dullness of vision. Von Noorden defined amblyopia as a ‘decrease of visual acuity in one eye when caused by abnormal binocular interaction or occurring in one or both eyes as a result of patterned vision deprivation during immaturity, for which no cause can be detected during the physical examination of the eye(s) at which in appropriate cases is reversible by therapeutic measures’.
Amblyopia is a functional reduction in the visual acuity of an eye caused by disuse during critical period of visual development. The mechanism of vision loss is not known, but it is thought to originate in the visual cortex. Amblyopia results in reduced visual acuity, binocularity, depth perception, and contrast sensitivity. Fusion and stereopsis, the central formation of three dimensional images, are dependent upon receiving clear images from each eye simultaneously.","The main symptom of amblyopia is decreased foveal visual acuity. Commonly used diagnostic criteria, is the loss of visual acuity of two or more lines on the Snellen vision chart.

Amblyopic eye presents an abnormal contour interaction which shows decrease in acuity for objects placed in a row compared with acuity for the same objects viewed separately (crowding phenomena).
Eccentric fixation.
Decreased contrast sensitivity.
Improved vision in dim background illumination.
Decreased brightness perception.
Binocular suppression of amblyopic eye.","A distinction must be made between potentially reversible functional amblyopia and irreversible organic amblyopia. Organic amblyopia is a term used to describe visual impairment due to obvious or non obvious ocular pathology, commonly affecting retina or optic nerve. Examples of organic amblyopia are optic nerve hypoplasia, optic atrophy and foveal hypoplasia. Functional amblyopia may occur along with organic amblyopia. Functional amblyopia normally occurs in an eye that is anatomically normal.
Functional amblyopia is caused by either form of vision deprivation or abnormal binocular interaction. Form- vision deprivation occurs due to conditions that obstruct the visual axis such as cataract, corneal opacity, vitreous haemorrhage, or severe ptosis, but it may also be produced by severe anisometropia. Abnormal binocular interaction refers to the condition in which the image projected onto the fovea of each eye is dissimilar enough to preclude fusion, thus prompting suppression and ultimately amblyopia of the suppressed eye. While strabismus may be the most obvious cause of abnormal binocular interaction, unilateral opacity of the media and anisometropia may participate in this mechanism as well.
Aetiological classification: This is the most commonly used classification and has high prognostic value. It is classified as

Strabismic amblyopia: Frequently amblyopia is associated with strabismus. Often it may not be known with certainty whether amblyopia is the consequence or the cause of strabismus. Constant tropias (squint) are most commonly associated with amblyopia unlike intermittent tropias (intermittent exotropia). This type of amblyopia is usually unilateral and the severity is not related with the degree of strabismus.
Refractive amblyopia: Ametropia is one of the most important causes of uni- and bilateral amblyopia.

- Isoametropic amblyopia: This is related to the age. It is said that high refractive errors either bilateral or unilateral would not affect the development of binocularity and visual acuity before the first year of life. Otherwise, refractive errors not corrected after one year of age are related with a high degree of uni- and bilateral decrease of vision.
In hypermetropia, insufficient accommodative effort which inadequately focuses the images on retina may produce amblyopia. In high myopia, objects close to the patient tend to be in focus and amblyopia is uncommon.
- Anisometropic amblyopia: It is likely to occur because the amount of accommodation necessary to focus the image in the less hypermetropic eye is utilised. Therefore, more hypermetropic eye receives blurred image. When the difference in hypermetropia exceeds two dioptres, amblyopia may be present. Some cases even with less amount of difference may develop amblyopia.
In anisomyopia, more myopic eye may be used for near vision and the less myopic for distance vision. It causes sharp image to be present in both the eyes. Amblyopia is unusual when myopia does not exceed five dioptres.
- Meridional amblyopia: Meridional amblyopia is due to astigmatism producing defocused images with specific orientation. Astigmatism appears to be an important factor for amblyopia, during first year of life.

Stimulus deprivation amblyopia: This produces most severe amblyopia. Nystagmus usually presents with amblyopia during first three months of life. Ptosis, congenital cataract, corneal opacity and eye occlusion also produces stimulus deprivation amblyopia. Unilateral cases are more amblyogenic. In general, early the treatment, better is the result. Congenital cataract is the leading cause of deprivation amblyopia and need quick diagnosis.
Idiopathic amblyopia: In some patients no amblyogenic factor is detected. It is postulated that this may be due to some amblyogenic factor, such as transient anisometropia in infancy, which might have disappeared with advancing age.
Occlusion amblyopia: Occlusion amblyopia is an iatrogenic condition caused by therapeutic patching of the eye with normal vision. It usually occurs in the sound eye as a result of amblyopia treatment of other eye, but it is occasionally seen in young children after occlusion therapy to treat ocular pathology, such as corneal abrasion.","Diagnosis of amblyopia is based mainly on measurement of visual acuity.
A diagnosis of amblyopia requires complete eye examination to rule out any organic cause as well as correct refractive error under cycloplegia. Clinically an organic cause is suspected in addition to functional amblyopia, if treatment improves vision up to certain level only. Amblyopia may be mimicked by any defect in the afferent visual system. Optic nerve glioma is the most important suspected pathology.
Visual acuity measurement 
Subjective and objective methods to test visual acuity have been proposed.

Optical grating: The different stimuli consist of repetitive gratings of predictable and precise luminance variations. Sinusoidal and square- wave gratings are some other forms to test visual acuity.
Optokinetic nystagmus: The primary use of optokinetic nystagmus is a rapid screen for the gross integrity of the visual system. Acuity may be measured as the finest grating that elicits a visible optokinetic nystagmus when different sizes of stripes are used.
Preferential looking test: It is based on the principle that infants tend to fixate a pattern stimulus rather than a homogeneous field. With this, inter-ocular acuity may be detected in children less than one year of age. Acuity is estimated by selecting the spatial frequency of the stripe that was fixed longer than the homogeneous field by 75% of the infants at a given age.
Visually evoked potential: Visually evoked potential is a summed cortical response to changes in some characteristics of a visual stimulus. The visual stimulus may be either a simple flash or a more complex pattern. All these techniques are complementary to evaluate vision in children who are unable to complete recognition acuity tests.
Visuscope: Visuscope is a type of direct ophthalmoscope that projects a focused image onto the retina so that the examiner can see the image on the retina. First the image is projected onto the parafoveal retina, and then the patient is asked to look at the image. Patient with central fixation re-fixates to place the image on fovea again. However, with eccentric fixation, the patient views with the parafoveal retinal area and show a wandering unsteady fixation.","Early management of amblyopia is critical for best visual acuity results. The basic strategy for treating amblyopia is to first provide a clear retinal image, and then correct ocular dominance if ocular dominance is present, as early as possible during the period of visual plasticity (birth to eight years of life).
I. Clear retinal image:
Patients with bilateral hypermetropia (&gt; + 5.00 D) should receive the full hypermetropic correction, as amblyopic eyes do not fully accommodate. Patients who are given partial correction of their high hypermetropia often shows very slow or no improvement in their amblyopia. Prescribe full astigmatic correction to provide a clear retinal image.
II. Correct ocular dominance
Correction of ocular dominance is accomplished by forcing fixation to the amblyopic eye through patching or blurring the vision of the sound eye by

Occlusion: Patching or occlusion therapy is based on covering the sound eye to stimulate amblyopic eye for vision. Part- time occlusion is preferred because this helps to preserve fusion.
Penalisation: Penalisation is a method for blurring the sound eye to force fixation to the amblyopic eye. Penalisation works if fixation is switched from sound eye to the amblyopic eye.
Occlusive contact lens: Occlusive contact lens may be used to treat amblyopia. This should be used as a last resort since many patients suffer complications of eye.
Bilateral light occlusion: A preventive treatment of amblyopia may be the use of bilateral light occlusion. It is shown that this bilateral occlusion prolongs the sensitive period of visual development.
Levodopa/ carbidopa in the treatment of amblyopia: Levodopa is a precursor for the catecholamine dopamine, neuro- transmitter/ modulator known to influence receptive fields.
Pleoptics: Pleoptics is a method of treating eccentric fixation associated with dense amblyopia. A bright light temporarily saturates the photoreceptors surrounding the fovea, which eliminates vision from the eccentric fixation point and forces fixation to the fovea.
Active stimulation: Active stimulation of the amblyopic eye as a way to improve vision in the amblyopic eye has been suggested.


Prognosis
The prognosis of amblyopia depends upon the age of the patient, severity of amblyopia, and type of amblyopia. The earlier the amblyopia occurs and longer it remains untreated, the worse is the prognosis. In general, bilateral amblyopia responds better than unilateral amblyopia, and myopic anisometropic amblyopia responds better than hypermetropic anisometropic amblyopia."
Ankyloblepharon,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/ankyloblepharon,"Ankyloblepharon is defined as adhesion of the edges of upper eyelid with the lower eyelid. The eyelids maintain their integrity and identity. The condition is usually congenital but may be acquired. In congenital ankyloblepharon, the fused eyelids fail to separate completely during development of embryo. Congenital ankyloblepharon is caused by developmental arrest leading to aberration in growth at either medial or lateral canthus. It may occur as a sporadic finding or in association with chromosomal/syndromic conditions.
Ankyloblepharon may be complete, partial, or interrupted. In interrupted form, known as ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum (AFA), epithelial bands are present between the lower and upper eyelids. These fine extensile cords attaching lower and upper eyelids may be single or multiple. The cords decrease the palpebral fissure height and reduce excursion of eyelids. It is reported in trisomy 18. In autosomal dominant Hay-Well’s syndrome, ankyloblepharon may be associated with ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate. In partial ankyloblepharon, the horizontal palpebral fissure is shortened.
Ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum is a form first described by Von Hasner in the year 1881.
Ankyloblepharon may also develop following

chemical injuries to the eyes.
Trauma.
Cicatrising diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or cicatricial ocular pemphigoid.
Inflammatory diseases such as herpes simplex infection or ulcerative blepharitis.","Patients may have symptoms such as

Complete, partial, or interrupted fusion of upper and lower eyelids.
Horizontal foreshortening of the palpebral fissure.
Pseudoexotropia due to lateral ankyloblepharon.
Pseudoesotropia due to medial ankyloblepharon.
Reduced eyelid excursion.
Associated features such as anophthalmos (absence of eyeball), microphthalmos (small eyeball), ptosis (drooping of eyelid), or cleft lip.
Downward displacement of lateral canthal angle.
Large fluid cyst due to accumulation of lacrimal tears in cases of total ankyloblepharon.","Congenital ankyloblepharon:
There is epithelial fusion of the eyelid margins of the developing foetus at about 9th week of gestation. Complete separation usually does not occur until about 7th month of foetal life. Rarely, the lid margins may remain fused at birth, which results in ankyloblepharon. The exact mechanism is still not clear. The problem may be in the epithelium fusion stage, in which there is fusion of the mesoderm of the lid margin rather than purely the epithelium.
Ankyloblepharon may be an isolated sporadic malformation. It may also be associated with other malformations which are presumably inherited as an autosomal dominant condition in some cases and as an autosomal recessive condition in others.
Congenital ankyloblepharon may be associated with central nervous system and/or cardiac anomalies, cleft lip and/or palate and gastrointestinal abnormalities.

Hay-Wells syndrome: A rare autosomal dominant disorder, known as Hay-Wells syndrome, may be associated with ankyloblepharon, ectodermal defects, and cleft lip and palate (AEC syndrome).
Curly hair, ankyloblepharon and nail dysplasia (CHAND) syndrome: This is an autosomal recessive disorder which is characterised by ankyloblepharon and ectodermal dysplasia, but affected patients have curly hair and hypoplastic nails, with absence of cleft lip or palate.
Edwards’ syndrome or Trisomy 18: Edwards’ syndrome or Trisomy 18 patients may also have ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum.
Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome: This is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterised by ectodermal dysplasia, cleft lip and/or palate, and mid-facial hypoplasia.

Acquired ankyloblepharon:
Various aetiologies for acquired ankyloblepharon have been described.

Chemical injuries to the eyes.
Burns.
Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Post traumatic prolonged contact of upper and lower eyelid.
Trachoma.
Ulcerative blepharitis.
Herpes simplex blepharoconjunctivitis.
Diphtheritic conjunctivitis.","Diagnosis of ankyloblepharon is based on clinical features.
Congenital ankyloblepharon
The eyelid margins are usually fused laterally, and less commonly medially. This condition may be associated with other developmental anomalies such as ptosis, microphthalmos, anophthalmos, or cleft lip. Lateral canthal angle may be displaced downward giving an anti-mongoloid appearance to the palpebral fissure. Lateral canthal tendon is lax or not developed so that there is significant laxity of the lower eyelids.
In ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum, one or more narrow epithelial strands connect the central part of lower and upper eyelid margins. These vary in dimensions from 0.5 mm to 5 mm in width, and may range from 1 mm to 10 mm in length. The zone of attachment lies between the meibomian gland orifices and the eyelashes.
In total ankyloblepharon, lacrimal secretions may accumulate beneath the eyelids forming a fluid cyst.
Acquired ankyloblepharon
Commonly, acquired ankyloblepharon is due to progressive conjunctival scarring resulting in fusion of the eyelids. Patients usually have a history of progressive scarring related to the primary disease. The eyelids show fusion from scar tissue.

Investigations
Detailed ocular examination is performed including measurement of intraocular pressure. Any ocular features of hydrocephalus are noted.
Screening may be required to rule out any genetic disorder associated with ankyloblepharon.

Differential diagnosis
Ankyloblepharon may be differentiated from

Blepharophimosis: In blepharophimosis, the palpebral aperture is reduced and there is telecanthus (increased medial intercanthus distance), but the eyelid margins are normal.
Euryblepharon: In both euryblepharon and ankyloblepharon, the lateral portion of the eyelid may be lax and displaced downward. In ankyloblepharon, the eyelid margins are fused together for some distance producing a shorter horizontal palpebral fissure. The fissure is longer than normal in cases of euryblepharon .
Cryptophthalmos (congenital absence of eyelid with skin passing continuously from head to cheeks over mal-formed eye).
Microphthalmos (small eyeball).
Pseudostrabismus.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Indications for therapy in cases of congenital and acquired cases of ankyloblepharon are similar. Presence of a significant central ankyloblepharon may occlude vision. In congenital type, it may potentially cause an occlusion type amblyopia. A significant nasal or temporal ankyloblepharon may restrict peripheral vision. Normal opening and closing of eyes may also be affected.
Management of ankyloblepharon is surgical and is indicated for improvement of visual field or for cosmetic reasons.
Surgical therapy
A potential contraindication to ankyloblepharon surgery is the problem of corneal exposure following release of marginal adhesions. This is significant in cases of ankyloblepharon developing after trauma, since other injuries such as damage to fifth and seventh intracranial nerve may be present. This is also true in similar cases with injury to cornea, lacrimal gland, decreased corneal sensitivity, decreased tear production, or lagophthalmos. Surgical procedures include
Congenital ankyloblepharon
Therapeutic approach to congenital ankyloblepharon depends upon the type and extent of lid margin adhesions. Spontaneous resolution of very fine filaments may occur in some cases of ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum (AFA).

Breaking of ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum (AFA) bands: Fine bands may be broken with muscle hook or by forcible separation of the eyelids. The remnants of bands usually shrink on their own and resolve.
Bipolar cautery: Some fine filaments resist easy breakage under stretch. Bipolar cautery may be applied to the bases of fine filaments to break them.
Separation of ankyloblepharon with reconstruction of eyelid margin: More severe cases require separation of ankyloblepharon with reconstruction of eyelid margin. Young children require general anaesthesia for the procedure.

Acquired ankyloblepharon
Determine the cause of scarring in cases of acquired ankyloblepharon. Any associated inflammation must be treated first before resorting to any surgical therapy.

Acquired ankyloblepharon with symblepharon: Acquired ankyloblepharon due to trauma or inflammatory conditions is frequently associated with formation of symblepharon (adhesion between eyeball and the eyelid). Ankyloblepharon repair may be combined with release of symblepharon adhesion and covering with mucous membrane or amniotic membrane graft.
Acquired ankyloblepharon without symblepharon: In mild cases of acquired ankyloblepharon without symblepharon, separation with blunt scissors may suffice. Irregularities at the eyelid margin may be thinned and trimmed and the raw surface is covered.


Prognosis
Visual prognosis is usually good if separation of eyelids is performed in timely manner.
Cosmetic appearance of the eyelids after separation of bands is usually very good in congenital ankyloblepharon.
The process of scarring may hamper the healing process following eyelid and corneal reconstructive surgery in cases of acquired ankyloblepharon."
Abnormal uterine bleeding,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/abnormal-uterine-bleeding,"Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common problem among (non-pregnant) women in the reproductive age. Formerly, it was known as dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). AUB is responsible for significant health problem and social embarrassment and it is one of the common reasons women seek health care. It has a significant impact on the quality of life for the women. Women with abnormal bleeding have a lower quality of life than the general female population.
The normal length of the menstrual cycle is normally between 24 days and 38days. A normal menstrual period generally lasts up to 8days. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is bleeding from the uterus that is longer than usual or that occurs at an irregular time. (Bleeding during pregnancy has different causes).
AUB leads to loss of productivity and may result in surgical interventions. AUB is reported to occur in 9 to 14% women between menarche and menopause. The prevalence varies in each country. In India, the reported prevalence of AUB is around 17.9%.
The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Menstrual Disorders Working Group has proposed to abandon the use of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), while continue to use the terms abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). HMB includes menometrorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding during menstrual periods and at irregular intervals), metrorrhagia (bleeding at irregular intervals) and polymenorrhoea (more frequent periods). HMB is defined as “excessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with the woman's physical, emotional, social and material quality of life, and which can occur alone, or in combination with other symptoms.
To standardize nomenclature of AUB, a new system known by the acronym PLAM-COEIN, was introduced in 2011 by FIGO. The PALM-COEIN system is based on etiology and pathology of disorder, where PALM describing structural causes(polyp; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; malignancy and hyperplasia) and COEIN denoting non- structural causes of AUB (coagulopathy; ovulatory disorders; endometrial factors; iatrogenic; and not classified).
Abnormal uterine bleeding in women of reproductive age is a manifestation of any of a number of pathologic disorders.","Abnormal uterine bleeding may present as any of the following symptoms-

Bleeding or spotting between periods
Heavy bleeding during period
Menstrual cycles that are longer than 38 days or shorter than 24 days
Irregular periods in which cycle length varies by more than 7-9 days
Bleeding or spotting after sex
Bleeding after menopause

(Normal menstrual cycle- The normal length of themenstrual cycleis between 24 days and 38 days. A normal menstrual period generally lasts up to 8 days.)
Abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age. However, at menarche (around 9-14 years of age, when a girl first starts having periods) and during perimenopause (mid forties), AUB is more common.","International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) introduced PLAM-COEIN system of classification in 2011 to define the causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. There are 9 main categories of etiology of AUB, which are arranged according to the acronym PALM-COEIN.
The components of the PALM group are structural causes that can be located visually with imaging techniques and/or histopathology. These causes are polyp; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; malignancy and hyperplasia.
Polyp (AUB-P) - Uterine polyps are growths from endometrium, (inner lining of the uterus) found into the uterine cavity. These are usually benign but some may be precancerous or cancerous.
Adenomyosis (AUB-A) - This is a condition in which the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows in to the muscle wall of the uterus ( myometrium). It may lead to heavy or longer-than-usual menstrual bleeding, as well as pain during menstrual cycle.
Leiomyoma (AUB-L) - These are benign fibromuscular tumors of the myometrium. Leiomyomas are known by several names, including “myoma,” and “fibroid.”
Malignancy and hyperplasia (AUB-M) - Malignancy and atypical hyperplasia are associated with, AUB and must be considered in nearly all women of reproductive age.
The COEIN group is related to non-structural causes of AUB that are not defined by imaging or histopathology. These causes are coagulopathy; ovulatory dysfunction; endometrial; iatrogenic; and not yet classified.
Coagulopathy (AUB-C)-The term “coagulopathy” includes the systemic disorders of hemostasis that may be associated with AUB. Prevalence and clinical impact of disorders of systemic hemostasis, or coagulopathies(AUB-C) (one of which, von Willebranddisease), can be identified in about 13% of women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).
Ovulatory dysfunction-Disorders of ovulation may present as different menstrual abnormalities ranging from amenorrhea (absence of periods), extremely light and infrequent bleeding, to unpredictable heavy menstrual bleeding. Ovulatory disorders may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, mental stress, obesity, anorexia, weight loss, extreme exercise. Ovulatory disorders frequently occur at the extremes of reproductive age: adolescence and the perimenopause. As women approach menopause, cycles shorten and often become intermittently anovulatory.
Endometrial (AUB-E) – When uterine bleedingoccurs due of the abnormalities of endometrium with normal ovulatoryfunction, and without any coagulopathy it is known as AUB-E.
Iatrogenic (AUB-I)-Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with the use of exogenous gonadal steroids, intrauterine devices, or other systemic or local agents is classified as iatrogenic (AUB-I).
Not yet classified (AUB-N) - A category of “not yet classified” was created to accommodate entities that are rarely encountered or are ill-defined.","Thorough history and physical examination are the preliminary components for diagnosing the cause of AUB, and also help to suggest investigations for final diagnosis and to guide options for management. Women with AUB may have multiple factors that may contribute in genesis of AUB or sometimes a pathology (such as subserosal leiomyoma) is present but not responsible for the AUB. In women of child bearing age, pregnancy and its related complications should be excluded.
History should include the following-

Amount, frequency, and regularity of bleeding; dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) or premenstrual symptoms-

o Ovulatory AUB is usually regular and is often associated with premenstrual symptoms and dysmenorrhea.
o Anovulatory bleeding is often irregular, heavy, and prolonged, which is more common near menarche and perimenopause.

Presence of post-coital or intermenstrual bleeding

o Inter menstrual bleeding or post-coital bleeding may be the first symptoms of gynaecological cancer.

Symptoms suggestive of anemia (such as weakness, shortness of breath with activity)
Sexual and reproductive history ( about contraception, sexually transmitted infections, desire for future pregnancy, infertility, cervical screening)
Impact on social and sexual functioning and quality of life
Symptoms suggestive of systemic causes of bleeding such as hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, coagulation disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome
Associated symptoms such as vaginal discharge, pelvic pain or pressure

Examination: Physical examination of the woman having AUB includes-

Assessment of weight, pallor, thyroid, breasts, acne, hirsutism scoring (if present)
Abdominal palpation
Visualization of the cervix
Bimanual (internal) examination

Laboratory Testing-

A complete blood count (CBC) - full blood count test should be carried out on all women with HMB to detect anaemia.
Blood type and cross match
Urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy

Tests for evaluating bleeding disorders-

Bleeding time, platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time are recommended in all adolescents and in adults with a positive history of coagulopathies.
Testing for coagulation disorders (such as von Willebrand disease) should be considered in women who have had HMB since menarche and have personal or family history suggesting a coagulation disorder.
Thyroid testing should only be carried out when other signs and symptoms of thyroid disease are present.
Liver function tests

Investigations for detecting structural and histological abnormalities: Imaging-

Ultrasonography is used in AUB cases to evaluate uterus, adnexa and endometrial thickness. Transvaginal ultrasonography may reveal leiomyoma, endometrial thickening, or focal masses.
Sonohysterography-It is more specific and sensitive in diagnosing lesions inside the uterine cavity and endometrial hyperplasia.
Hysteroscopy-It is an examination of the uterine cavity and the surface of the endometrium (inner lining of uterus) using a hysteroscope for diagnosis and characterization of intrauterine abnormalities.
MRI (magnetic resonance Imaging) - MRI can be used to differentiate between fibroids and adenomyosis and for mapping exact location of fibroids while planning conservative surgery and prior to therapeutic embolization for fibroids.
Endometrial biopsy/ histopathology- A sample of the endometrium is removed and examined under the microscope. The endometrium may be obtained during direct visualization with a hysteroscope or blindly using a sampler (a plastic tube passed through the cervix that uses suction to obtain endometrium). The purpose is to detect the pre-malignant condition of endometrial hyperplasia with cytological atypia or endometrial carcinoma.
Computed tomography (CT)-This X-ray procedure shows internal organs and structures in cross section.","The ultimate goal of any form of treatment is to reduce menstrual flow in order to improve quality of life. The two main objectives of managing acute AUB are:
1) To control the current episode of heavy bleeding and
2) To reduce menstrual blood loss in subsequent cycles.
Medical therapy is considered the preferred initial treatment. Conservative and uterine-preserving treatment options are used initially; however, ineffective medical treatment and certain situations need prompt surgical management.
Once the acute episode of bleeding has been controlled, medical therapy can be started as long term treatment. In medical therapy multiple treatment options are available include levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), oral contraceptives in monthly or extended cycles (OCs), progestin therapy (oral or intramuscular), tranexamic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists.
Surgery- When AUB does not respond to medical therapy, a surgical procedure is required to control the bleeding. Surgical treatment is based on the clinical diagnosis, the severity of bleeding, contraindications and response to medical management, the underlying medical condition, age and fertility status of women (whether she wants to have children).

Hysteroscopic surgical removal of polyp- Polyps that cause AUB can be removed for controlling symptoms and even asymptomatic polyps need to be removed to exclude the chances of cancer.
Endometrial ablation destroys the lining of the uterus. It stops or reduces the total amount of bleeding.
Uterine artery embolization is a procedure used to treat fibroids. This procedure blocks the blood vessels to the uterus, which in turn stops the blood flow that fibroids need to grow.
Dilation and curettage with concomitant hysteroscopy may be of value for those patients in whom intrauterine pathology is suspected or a tissue sample is required.
Myomectomy is done to remove the fibroids.
Hysterectomy- Hysterectomy is defined as the surgical removal of the uterus. It is one of the most common of all surgical procedures and can also include the removal of the fallopian tubes, ovaries and cervix. Depending on the size, mobility of the uterus, the location of uterine fibroids, size and shape of the vagina, hysterectomy can be performed in different ways such as abdominal hysterectomy (AH), vaginal hysterectomy (VH) and laparoscopic hysterectomy.

Hysterectomy should not be used as a first-line treatment solely for HMB. Hysterectomy should be considered only when other treatment options have failed or are contraindicated or are declined by the woman. A woman with AUB/HMB should have adequate time and support from healthcare professionals in the decision-making process."
Acquired Capillary Haemangioma of Eyelid,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/acquired-capillary-haemangioma-of-eyelid,"Acquired Capillary Haemangioma of Eyelid (Cherry haemangioma, senile haemangioma) is a common skin lesion in middle aged and older patients. Virtually, it occurs in all adults at one time or the other. The lesions may be small and may be ignored. The number of haemangiomas varies from one to two in children to even up to hundred in some elderly patients. Most commonly it affects chest or extremities, but can occasionally affect eyelids and periocular area. It varies in size from being barely visible to a dome shaped bright red swellings about 5 mm in diameter.
Histologically, acquired haemangioma is identical to infantile capillary haemangioma.
Haemangiomas are managed by observation over time for any increase in size or are surgically removed for cosmetic reasons.","Solitary acquired haemangioma of the eyelid appear as distinct red to red-blue papule ranging in size from about 0.5 mm to 5 mm in size.
Patient may present with bleeding haemangioma following trauma.","The acquired capillary haemangioma looks similar to mature type of congenital capillary haemangioma.
Hormonal changes during puberty and pregnancy may cause the development of vascular lesions. Trauma and irritative agents may act as inciting factors for production of capillary haemangioma.","Clinically, solitary acquired capillary haemangioma of eyelid may present as a red to red-blue papule which may range from 0.5 to 5 mm in size. Smaller lesions are red in colour and the larger ones give a bluish appearance. These may become pedunculated with cherry-like surface irregularity, hence the name cherry haemangioma. It generally moves with the skin. Localised haemangiomas are usually very compressible. It may bleed following trauma.

Pathology
Histopathologically, in early stages, acquired capillary haemangioma is similar to congenital capillary haemangioma. It shows newly formed capillaries with narrow lumina and prominent endothelial cells arranged in lobular fashion.
In fully matured lesion, the vascular lumen is dilated, the endothelial cells more flattened, and the stroma is oedematous and hyalinised. In acquired capillary haemangioma, there is less capillary proliferation as compared to a similar condition called pyogenic granuloma.

Differential diagnosis
Pyogenic granuloma: Some authorities consider acquired capillary haemangioma to be closely related to pyogenic granuloma. But pyogenic granuloma shows more endothelial proliferation than capillary haemangioma. The term capillary haemangioma of the pyogenic granuloma type is applied to this lesion.
Angiosarcoma
Cavernous haemangioma
Eyelid varix","Most acquired capillary haemangiomas are just observed over time, since they are generally small and have no malignant potential.

Surgical therapy
Complete excision of the larger haemangiomas may be resorted to for cosmetic reasons. Electrodissection, cryotherapy or radioablation may be done to destroy the growth.
Prognosis is usually good."
Anaemia during pregnancy (Maternal anemia),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/anaemia-during-pregnancy-maternal-anemia,"Anaemia during pregnancy is one of the important factors associated with a number of maternal and foetal complications. It decreases the woman’s reserve to tolerate bleeding either during or after child birth and makes prone to infections. Anaemia during pregnancy also has been associated with increased risk of intra uterine growth restriction, premature delivery, low birth weight (LBW) and maternal and child mortality.
World Health Organization (WHO)/World Health Statistics data shows that 40.1% of pregnant women worldwide were anemic in 2016. The condition is prominent in Southeast Asian countries where about half of all global maternal deaths are due to anemia and India contributes to about 80% of the maternal death due to anaemia in South Asia. There is marginally decrease in prevalence of anemia in pregnant women in India from 58% in NFHS-3 (National Family Health Survey-2005-06) to 50 % in NFHS-4 survey (2015-16).
Among the various causes of anaemia in women, iron deficiency is the most common cause, primarily due to their recurrent menstrual loss and secondary due to poor supply of iron in the diet. During pregnancy anemia is common due to increased demand of iron for the growing fetus and placenta; and increased red blood cell mass (with expanded maternal blood volume in the third trimester), which is further aggravated with other factors such as childbearing at an early age, repeated pregnancies, short intervals between pregnancies and poor access to antenatal care and supplementation. Indian Council of Medical Research considers haemoglobin (Hb) level below 10.9 g/dl as cutoff point for anemia during pregnancy.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has given emphasis to prevent anaemia under RMNCH+A services. National Health Policy 2017 also addressed malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies interventions. “National Iron Plus Initiative” launched in 2013 is a comprehensive strategy to combat the public health challenge of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) prevalent across the life cycle.
National Nutrition Mission has been setup under the oversight of the Ministry of Women and Child Development with the aim to reduce anaemia among young children, adolescent girls and women of reproductive age (15–49 years) by one third of NFHS-4 levels by 2022.","Early symptoms of anemia are usually nonspecific such as fatigue, weakness, light-headedness, mild dyspnea during exertion.
Other symptoms and signs may include pallor of the eyelids, tongue, nail beds, and palms, spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia), and oedema.
The restless leg syndrome during pregnancy and pica (an eating disorder to lick or eat non-food items, such as gypsum, chalk, soil, ice or paper) are also prevalent symptoms in pregnant women.
Tachycardia, hypotension and even congestive cardiac failure can occur in severe cases.
Anemia increases risk of preterm delivery. Postpartum anaemia is associated with decreased quality of life, including increased tiredness, breathlessness, palpitations and infections. Women who have postpartum anemia may also experience greater stress and depression and may be less responsive towards their infants.","The common causes of anemia during pregnancy are nutritional disorders and infections. Among nutritional disorders iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia globally. Other conditions such as folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A deficiency, chronic inflammation, parasitic infections, and inherited disorders can all cause anemia.
Causes of nutritional anaemia in women: 

Insufficient quantity of iron-rich foods and, and low bioavailability of dietary iron (non-haem iron from plant sources)
Less quantity of iron enhancers (foods rich in vitamin C such as citrus fruits) in the diet
Excessive quantity of iron inhibitors in diet, especially during mealtimes (such as tea, coffee; calcium-rich foods)
Iron loss during menstruation
Poor iron stores from infancy, childhood deficiencies and adolescent anaemia
Iron loss from post-partum haemorrhage
Increased iron requirement during pregnancy
Teenage pregnancy
Repeated pregnancies with less than 2 years’ interval
Iron loss due to parasite load (e.g., malaria, intestinal worms)
Poor environmental sanitation and unsafe drinking water

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA): Among women, iron deficiency prevalence is higher than among men due to menstrual iron losses and the extreme iron demands of a growing foetus during pregnancies, which are approximately two times the demands in the non-pregnant state. There is substantial increase in iron requirement during pregnancy that ranges from 0.8mg per day in the first trimester to 7.5mg per day in the third trimester.
IDA occurs when the body doesn’t have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of haemoglobin. Low bio-availability of iron in food, inadequate intake of iron rich food and iron enhancers, and excess consumption of iron inhibitors can contribute to iron deficiency anemia.
Folate deficiency anaemia- Folate is a type of B vitamin needs to produce new cells including healthy red blood cells. During pregnancy, women need extra folate and when they don’t get enough from diet, it results in to anemia. Folate deficiency can directly contribute to certain types of birth defects such as neural tube abnormalities (spina bifida). A diet low in fresh fruits, vegetables, and fortified cereals is the main cause of folate deficiency.
Vitamin B12 deficiency can also lead to anaemia during pregnancy which may contribute to birth defects such as neural tube abnormalities, and could lead to preterm labor. Folate deficiency and vitamin B-12 deficiency can often be found together.
Helminthic infestation (such as hookworm) is associated with IDA due to chronic intestinal blood loss.
Malaria causes anaemia by rupturing RBCs and suppressing production of RBCs. Malaria in pregnancy increases the risk of maternal anaemia, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, LBW and neonatal deaths.
Sickle cell disease and thalassemia are inherited disorders of haemoglobin result in recurrent haemolytic anaemia.
Infections: Certain chronic diseases, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases can interfere with the production of RBCs, resulting in chronic anaemia. Kidney failure can also cause anaemia
In developing countries early onset of childbearing, high number of births, short intervals between births, and poor access to antenatal care and iron supplementation also contribute to occurrence of anemia during pregnancy.","Diagnosis of anemia during pregnancy is done by the symptoms, clinical signs and investigations.
Investigations-
(a)Hemoglobin estimation (Hb)- Haemoglobin estimation is the most practical method of diagnosing anemia. Compulsory haemoglobin estimation by Cyanmeth-haemoglobin method by using Semi-autoanalyser or photo calorimeter at 14-16 weeks, 20-24 weeks, 26-30 weeks and 30-34 weeks of pregnancy for all pregnant mothers (minimum four Hb estimations) is indicated under routine antenatal checkups. The interval between one haemoglobin estimation and another should have a minimum of four weeks.
Hemoglobin cut off for anemia during pregnancy (ICMR-1989)


Normal (g/dL)

Mild (g/dL)

Moderate (g/dL)

Severe (g/dL) 

Very Severe (g/dL)


11 or high

10-10.9


7-9.9

4-6.9

&lt;4




(b) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte Hb content, % hypochromic cells, and peripheral blood smear are used to detect type of anemia. Peripheral blood should be examined for malarial parasites also.
(c)To rule out refractory anemia, urine should be checked for albumin, sugar and deposits. If deposits are more than 4-6 cells, then urine culture should be done. In areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, urine examination for occult blood and schistosomes can be performed.
(d)Serum ferritin is a sensitive indicator of IDA in pregnant women. Concentration below 30μg/L, indicates early iron depletion.
(e)Soluble transferrin receptor (sTFR)- Its levels are increased in iron deficiency anemia
(f)Serum iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) are the other independent indicators of iron stores or availability.
(g)Bone marrow examination is only indicated in cases where there is no response to iron therapy after 4 weeks or for diagnosis of Kala-azar or in suspected aplastic anemia.
(h)Stool examination -As worm infestations are common causes of anemia, stool examination for ova and cysts should be done consecutively for 3 days in all cases.","As the need for iron increases during pregnancy, prophylactic oral iron therapy is given to all pregnant women with normal laboratory values. All pregnant women at 14-16th week (second trimester) should be given one tablet of Albendazole 400mg – single dose. In the anemic mother management and form of therapeutic iron supplementation depend on the duration of pregnancy and severity of anemia.
Supplementation- Interventions as suggested by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India:
(i) At 14-16 weeks -
First Hb estimation should be done at 14-16th week pregnancy during antenatal visit:
• If the Hb is more than 11 gms, prophylactic doses of IFA tablets are given.
• If the Hb is 7.1-10.9 gms%, therapeutic doses of IFA tablets are given.
• If the Hb is less than 7 gms%, she has to be referred to CEmONC centres (Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and New Born Care Services) for blood transfusion and further management.
(Prophylactic dose: Tab.IFA (100 mg of iron with 0.5mg of folic acid) once daily for 100 days.
Therapeutic dosage: Tab.IFA twice daily for 100 days.
(ii) At 20-24 weeks- Second Hb estimation has to be done between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation for all pregnant mothers.
• If the Hb is more than 11 gms, give prophylactic dose of IFA tablets.
• If the Hb is 9-10.9 gms%, give therapeutic dose of IFA tablets.
• If haemoglobin level is between 7.1 to 8.9 gm/dl. Intravenous (IV) Iron sucrose infusion should be given.
• If the Hb is less than 7 gms%, she has to be referred to CEmONC centres for blood transfusion and further management.
(iii) At 26-30 weeks- Third Hb estimation has to be done between 26 and 30 weeks of gestation for all pregnant mothers. For ante-natal mothers infused with iron sucrose infusion during 20-24 weeks, Hb estimation has to be done after one month.
• If the Hb is more than 11 gms, assure and counsel to continue with prophylactic dose of IFA tablets.
• If the Hb is 9-10.9 gms%, assure and counsel the mother for further improvement of Hb% and continue with therapeutic dose of IFA tablets.
• If the Hb is 7.1 -8.9 gms%

For mothers who received iron sucrose infusion, give two top up doses of 100 mgs of Iron sucrose infusion with 2-4 days’ interval between each infusion.
For mothers who had not received injection iron sucrose earlier during current pregnancy, give four doses of iron sucrose injection (100 mg in 100 ml of normal saline infused over 20 -30 minutes once a day x 4 days over a period of 2 weeks with 2-4 days of interval between each infusion)

• If the Hb is less than 7 gms%, she has to be referred to CEmONC centres for blood transfusion and further management.
(iv) At 30-34 weeks 
All antenatal mothers have to be subjected to Hb estimation at 30-34 weeks irrespective of mode of management of anaemia previously.
• If the Hb is more than 11 gms, assure and counsel to continue with prophylactic dose of IFA tablets
• If the Hb is 9-10.9 gms%, assure and counsel the mother for further improvement of Hb% and continue with therapeutic dose of IFA tablets.
• If the Hb checked at 30-34 weeks does not improve (still less than 9 gms%), refer to higher institution for blood transfusion and further management.
Vitamin supplementation- Vitamin B12 and Vitamin C supplementation is also given along with iron supplementation.
Diet counselling-All the mothers should be encouraged to take iron rich foods and avoid coffee and tea just after meals."
Antepartum hemorrhage (Bleeding in late pregnancy),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/antepartum-hemorrhage-bleeding-in-late-pregnancy,"Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract, occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby. APH complicates 3–5% of pregnancies; and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide.
The causes of APH include: placenta praevia, placental abruption and local causes (such as bleeding from the vulva, vagina or cervix). Placenta previa &amp; placental abruption constitute 50% of APH.","Symptoms of antepartum haemorrhage (APH) consist of vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy and before delivery. Along with vaginal bleeding other symptoms may be-
(a) In APH due to placenta previa, vaginal bleeding is painless, or bleeding occurs after sexual intercourse. Initial episodes are usually mild and ceases spontaneously only to recur. Some types of placenta previa resolve on their own by 32–35 weeks of pregnancy as the lower part of the uterus stretches and thins out. Labor and delivery then can occur normally. If placenta previa does not resolve, cesarean delivery may be needed.
(b) In APH due to placental abruption symptoms include:

Vaginal bleeding
Abdominal pain
Back pain
Uterine tenderness
Uterine contractions,
Firmness in the uterus or abdomen","The causes of APH include: placenta praevia, placental abruption and local causes (such as bleeding from the vulva, vagina or cervix). Abruption is more likely to be related to conditions occurring during pregnancy and placenta praevia is more likely to be related to conditions existing prior to pregnancy.
Placenta praevia is defined as a placenta that lies wholly or partly within the lower uterine segment. It occurs in .4%-.8 % of pregnancies. The condition is mostly diagnosed on ultrasound examination.
Classification of placenta previa (Williams)

Total placenta previa: Internal cervical os is covered completely by placenta.
Partial placenta previa: Internal cervical os is partially covered by placenta.
Marginal placenta previa: The placenta is implanted in the lower segment such that the placental edge does not actually reach the internal cervical os but is in close proximity of it.

Factors associated with the development of placenta praevia include:

increasing maternal parity,
advancing maternal age,
increasing placental size (multiple pregnancy),
endometrial damage (previous dilatation and curettage), endometritis
previous caesarean section, uterine scars and pathology
previous myomectomy
placental abnormalities,
previous placental praevia, and
cigarette smoking.

Placental abruption/ abruptio placentae –Placental abruption is the premature separation of a normally situated placenta from the uterine wall, resulting in haemorrhage before the delivery of the foetus. In placental abruption some of the bleeding escapes through the cervix causing external haemorrhage and sometimes bleeding is concealed when blood does not escape externally. Placental abruption can occur in up to 5% of pregnancies.
The precise cause of abruption is unknown, but risk factors for placental abruption include: pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, non-vertex presentations, polyhydramnios, advanced maternal age, multiparty, low body mass index (BMI), pregnancy following assisted reproductive techniques, intrauterine infection, premature rupture of membranes, abdominal trauma (both accidental and resulting from domestic violence), smoking, drug misuse (cocaine and amphetamines) during pregnancy and maternal thrombophilia. Bleeding in first trimester also increases the risk of abruption later in the pregnancy.
Placental abruption is mostly diagnosed on ultrasound examination. Though Sonography is not sensitive for the detection of placental abruption but it is highly specific.
Placenta accrete- When the placenta (or part of the Placenta) invades and is inseparable from the uterine wall, it is called placenta accrete. It can cause bleeding during the third trimester and severe blood loss during delivery.
Other causes-In a small proportion of cases cervicitis, trauma, vulval varicosities (varicoseveins at the outer surface of the female genitalia -vulva), genital tumours, genital infections and vasa previa may be the cause of APH. Many of these conditions are evident on the initial speculum examination.","Diagnosis of antepartum hemorrhage is first based on clinical suspicion. Initially clinical assessment of women presenting with APH is done by medical person to establish urgency of intervention required to manage maternal or fetal compromise.
If there is no maternal compromise a full history should be taken. It includes history taking to assess coexisting symptoms such as pain, an assessment of the extent of vaginal bleeding, the cardiovascular condition of the mother, and an assessment of fetal wellbeing.
In placenta previa, uterus is felt to be relaxed on palpation and non-tender. Generally presenting part is high up and floating.
In placental abruption, the triad of sudden onset of abdominal pain, bleeding per vagina, tense and tender uterus constitutes the main diagnostic criteria.
Speculum examination- A speculum examination can be useful to identify cervical dilatation or can visualise a lower genital tract cause for the APH.
If placenta praevia is a possible diagnosis (for example, a previous scan shows a low placenta, or there is a high presenting part on abdominal examination, or the bleeding is painless), digital vaginal examination should not be performed until an ultrasound has excluded placenta praevia.
If APH is associated with pain or uterine activity digital vaginal examination can provide information on cervical dilatation.
Blood tests-
·Full blood count with haemoglobin estimation
·Blood grouping with Rh factor
·Screening for coagulation factor
·Liver function tests
·Urea and electrolyte test
Ultrasound scan (USG)-
Women presenting with APH should have an ultrasound scan performed to confirm or exclude placenta praevia, if the placental site is not already known. Transvaginal ultrasound is more accurate than transabdominal in diagnosing placenta previa.
The sensitivity of ultrasound for the detection of retroplacental clot (abruption) is poor. However, when the ultrasound suggests an abruption, the likelihood that there is an abruption is high.
Transvaginal ultrasound (an ultrasound view of the cervix) in combination with color Doppler (which can show blood flowing through veins) is the most effective tool in the diagnosis of vasa previa during pregnancy and can be utilized in patients at risk.
MRI is used only to differentiate different degrees of myometrial invasion.","Management of APH depends on various factors. These are- amount and cause of APH, condition of mother and foetus, duration of pregnancy and presence of associated complication. Each pregnant woman with APH is assessed on an individual basis and according to that clinical judgment is applied.
It includes: a) General measures (common to all patients with bleeding)
b) Specific measures: Immediate delivery or expectant management and management of complications
APH associated with maternal or fetal compromise is an obstetric emergency. Management includes maternal resuscitation and delivery of the foetus. Delivery should be planned in an appropriate setting with adequate resources.
Expectant management may be considered when the mother is stable, foetus is immature (&lt;37 weeks). The goal is to prolong pregnancy with the hope of improving foetal maturity and survival.
Anti – D Ig prophylaxis may be given to those women who are Rh negative."
Acute encephalitis syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/acute-encephalitis-syndrome,"Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a serious public health problem in India. It is characterized as acute-onset of fever and a change in mental status (mental confusion, disorientation, delirium, or coma) and/or new-onset of seizures in a person of any age at any time of the year. The disease most commonly affects children and young adults and can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality.
Viruses are the main causative agents in AES cases, although other sources such as bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals, toxins and noninfectious agents have also been reported over the past few decades.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the major cause of AES in India (ranging from 5%-35%).Herpes simplex virus, Influenza A virus, West Nile virus, Chandipura virus, mumps, measles, dengue, Parvovirus B4, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus and scrub typhus, S.pneumoniae are the other causes of AES in sporadic and outbreak form in India. Nipah virus, Zika virus are also found as causative agents for AES. The etiology in a large number of AES cases still remains unidentified.
AES due to JEV was clinically diagnosed in India for the first time in 1955 in the southern State of Madras, now Tamil Nadu. During 2018, 10485 AES cases and 632 deaths were reported from 17 states to the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP)*in India, with a case fatality rate around 6 per cent. AES cases were reported mainly from Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh.","Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) is a general description of the clinical presentation of a disease characterized by high fever altered consciousness mostly in children below 15 years of age.
Clinically, a case of AES is defined as a person of any age, at any time of year with the acute onset of fever and a change in mental status (including symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, coma, or inability to talk) AND/OR new onset of seizures (excluding simple febrile seizures). Other early clinical findings may include an increase in irritability, somnolence or abnormal behavior greater than that seen with usual febrile illness.","Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) has a very complex etiology. Causative agents of AES include a wide variety of viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and non- infectious agents. While Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in India (ranging from 5-35%), the etiology in a large number of cases however remains unidentified. In India during 2018, 15% of cases of AES were found positive for infection due to JEV.
Herpes simplex virus, Influenza A virus, West Nile virus, Chandipura virus, mumps, measles, dengue, Parvovirus B4, enteroviruses and scrub typhus, S.pneumoniae are the other causes of AES in sporadic and outbreak cases in India. In many cases, however, no etiological agent is determined. Tick-borne encephalitis virus – TBEV, Zika virus, Nipah virus are also found positive in AES cases.
Some are the zoonotic disease, that transmitted from animals to humans via mosquitoes (e.g. Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus) or ticks, (Tick-borne encephalitis virus), while for other flaviviruses humans are the natural hosts; these include dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV).
Although AES cases other than JE continue to be reported throughout the year, there is an overall increase of total AES cases since the month of June, peak during July- August and decline in September- October.
The AES cases in Muzaffarpur, Bihar and adjoining litchi producing districts have been observed mostly during April to June particularly in children who are undernourished with a history of visiting litchi orchards. In 2014, a relationship between consumption of litchi and AES was postulated by National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi (along with Centre for Disease Control US) in acute encephalitis in children, in Muzaffarpur*.","The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme in India has set up country wide surveillance for AES through sentinel sites with a focus on detecting Japanese encephalitis (JEV). In the sentinel surveillance network, AES/JE is diagnosed by lgM Capture ELISA, and virus isolation is done in National","Management of AES is essentially symptomatic. First line of management should be started at grass root level. To reduce severe morbidity and mortality it is important to identify early warning signs and refer patient to higher health facility.
Danger Signs-

Referral to nearest first referral health facility."
Amaurosis Fugax,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/amaurosis-fugax,"Amaurosis Fugax or transient monocular blindness (TMB) refers to transient brief blindness, blurring, fogging, or dimming of vision, varying in duration from few seconds to minutes or even hours in some cases. The duration of visual impairment is brief usually less than fifteen minutes and rarely exceeding thirty minutes. The term Amaurosis fugax has been used not only for monocular condition, but also for the transient loss of vision in both eyes (less common). Most of the patients are affected for about one to five minutes only. Generally, recovery is in the same pattern as the visual loss, although usually more gradual. Amaurosis is also known as blackout.
It is thought to occur from transient occlusion of the ophthalmic circulation and is a risk factor for acute stroke. Fundus examination is commonly normal but may show prior retinal arterial emboli or attenuation of arteries. Investigations like carotid ultrasonography and cardiac echography may help in finding source of embolus.
It is produced by ocular vascular occlusive disorders such as

Central retinal artery (CRA) occlusion
Central retinal vein (CRV) occlusion
CRV occlusion with cilioretinal artery occlusion
Branch retinal arteriole occlusion
Branch retinal vein occlusion
Ocular ischaemic syndrome (OIS)
Arteritic and non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION)

It may also be seen in giant cell arteritis.
Detailed history of Amaurosis attack and the duration of visual disturbance helps in classification of visual loss occurrence into following four types
Type I: It is due to transient retinal ischaemia
Type II: It is due to retinal vascular insufficiency
Type III: It occurs due to vasospasm
Type IV: It occurs in association with antiphospholipid antibodies but also include cases due to unknown causes.","Symptoms vary according to the type of Amaurosis depending upon visual loss occurrence:
Type I: It is characterised by sudden brief attack of partial or complete diminution or obscuration of vision, lasting for seconds to minutes, followed by total recovery. Partial impairment presents as ascending or descending curtain or a blind moving sideways across the eye. Visual field defect is complete or partial. It is due to retinal ischaemia, embolisation or arteritis.
Type II: It is less rapid in onset and may be associated with loss of contrast vision and photopsiae. It lasts from minutes to hours. Pain may be rarely associated and the recovery is complete. Visual field defect is complete or partial. It is produced due to retinal hypoperfusion and carotid occlusive disease.
Type III: It is of abrupt onset and show photopsiae, scintillating sparkles, and is often accompanied by pain. It is due to vasospasm and migraine. Visual field defect is complete and may lead to progressive contraction. It lasts for minutes only and the recovery is usually complete.
Type IV: It is of abrupt onset and may alternate between two eyes. It occurs in association with antiphospholipid antibodies but also include cases due to unknown causes. Visual field defect may resemble any of the types from one to three as mentioned above. Duration may go up to any length of time and the recovery is complete.","The causes of Amaurosis fugax are divided into five groups

Embolic
Haemodynamic
Neurologic
Ocular
Idiopathic

Usually Amaurosis fugax is typically used to refer to transient visual loss of embolic origin. Episodic attacks of blindness occur as arteriosclerotic plaques progressively narrow the lumen of ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA), leading to reduced pressure and flow in ophthalmic artery. Cholesterol crystals (Hollenhorst plaques) or ulcerating plaque may embolise to ophthalmic or central retinal artery, without causing permanent visual loss.
TMB is regarded as one variety of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and should be recognised as a warning sign of impending stroke. Frequency of attacks may vary from several times in a day to once only every few months. Cerebral ischaemia may affect both eyes with ipsilateral hemifield defect.
Amaurosis usually occurs in elderly patients over fifty years of age who have vascular risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, history of smoking, or previous episodes of TIAs.","Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination.
Patients present with sudden monocular loss of vision that usually is less than fifteen minutes, and it rarely exceeds thirty minutes. Vision loss may be complete or partial. It is described as a curtain falling down in front of the eye or as a generalised darkening. Patient may experience one to multiple episodes, which usually resolve spontaneously. The attacks may sometimes be associated with ipsilateral cerebral TIA, with contralateral neurological features.
Some patients may present with emboli such as cholesterol plaques, which may result in retinal ischaemia. Depending upon the severity of ischaemia, BRA or CRA occlusion may develop.
Other group of patients, mainly with ocular ischaemic syndrome, ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion produces hypoperfusion to retinal photoreceptors with resultant blurring or diminution of vision. Patients with ocular ischaemic syndrome present with transient blurring of vision. Vision deteriorates with progression of disease. Episcleral vessels may show congestion and there may be mild anterior chamber inflammation. Fundus examination usually shows dilated and tortuous retinal veins with narrowed arterioles and dot/blot haemorrhages. Persistent hypoperfusion may lead to development of neovascularisation in iris, angle of anterior chamber, optic disc, and retina.
The visual loss from migraine may last from few seconds to an hour. It is preceded by a scintillating scotoma, or is precipitated by exercise or rise in body temperature (Uhthoff sign).
Patients with giant cell arteritis may show palpable hard arteries or tenderness of scalp.

Investigations
Besides general examination, following investigations may help in assessment of vessels.

Doppler test: Doppler of carotid vessels may help in assessment of vessels.
Magnetic resonance imaging: It may help in assessment of vascular patency.
Computed tomography: Vascular patency may also be assessed by computed tomography.
Electrocardiogram/ Holter monitoring: This helps to localise any cardiac arrhythmia or any possible source of cardiac emboli.
Neuroimaging: It may be done to rule out any other cause of vision loss.


Differential diagnosis
Besides CRA/CRV occlusion, monocular vision loss may be due to conditions such as

Papilloedema
Multiple sclerosis
Sickle cell anaemia
Epilepsy","Management
Treatment of amaurosis fugax may help in prevention of ischaemic attacks. Systemic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac arrhythmias, and hyperlipidaemia state should be managed with appropriate treatment.
Medical therapy
It may include

Aspirin: Aspirin, an antiplatelet agent may be used as an antithrombotic agent to prevent arterial thrombosis.
Anticoagulants: Anticoagulants may be given to prevent stroke.

Surgical therapy
Since embolisation is one of the important reason, treating amaurosis may help in prevention of full-blown stroke. It requires treatment of carotid artery stenosis.
It may be managed by

Angioplasty
Stenting

Patients who either are unfit for surgery or those who are not having any symptoms, endovascular approach may be instituted."
Abducens nerve Palsy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/abducens-nerve-palsy,"Abducens (or Abducent) nerve Palsy or Cranial nerve six palsy (CN VI) is a common neuro-ophthalmic disorder. Since CN VI has a long intracranial course, it may be affected by multiple aetiologies. It may be unilateral or bilateral condition.
CN VI is a pure motor nerve that innervates ipsilateral (same side) lateral rectus muscle of the eye and controls abduction (outward movement) of the eyeball. This nerve has the longest intracranial course amongst all the cranial nerves. A palsy affecting this nerve alone is less common. Usually, seventh (CN VII or facial) and eighth (CN VIII or vestibulocochlear) cranial nerves are also affected along with it, which signals a central cause.
Children are more likely to be affected by a tumour, and older people are more likely to have vasculopathy producing ischaemia.
CN VI palsy may present with ‘false localising sign’, suggesting impingement, when in fact, the causative reason/tumour may be remotely present, or there may not be any detectable reason/tumour. Similarly, raised intracranial pressure may stretch CN VI, and perhaps compression of its vascular supply.
The sixth cranial nerve is the most commonly affected motor nerve to the eye in adults.","Symptoms include

Diplopia (double vision), worse in the field of palsy
Esotropia (inward deviation of eyeball)
Head turn towards the affected side to maintain fusion and thus to avoid diplopia in mild cases
Closure of one eye voluntarily to avoid diplopia in severe unilateral palsy or bilateral involvement","The causes of Abducens nerve palsy are varied.
Common aetiologies in children are

Congenital
Raised intracranial pressure
Trauma
Tumour
Infection

In addition to the aetiologies seen in children, adults are affected by vasculopathies (most common acquired causes) also, such as

Diabetes mellitus
Hypertension

Other conditions include

Disorders of subarachnoid space
Cavernous sinus syndrome
Orbital apex syndrome


CN VI nerve palsy is a rare initial presentation in multiple sclerosis.
Recurrence of CN VI may take place more than once, and has been reported in both adults and children.
Inherited autosomal dominant condition may be the reason for familial recurrent CN VI palsy along with involvement of seventh (facial) nerve.","Patients with CN VI paresis present with esotropia (inward deviation) of the affected eye. Outward movement beyond primary position or midline is lost or reduced. Patients presenting with partial or mild palsy adopt posture with head turn toward the affected side to minimise diplopia by keeping the affected eye adducted (inward movement). Severe cases may shut the eye or cover it to avoid diplopia.
Presentation depends upon the aetiology.
Congenital CN VI palsy may present with congenital esotropia reported to occur about six to eight weeks of life. Most cases without peripheral misdirection of nerves are transient and probably are due to perinatal trauma. There are two types of transient CN VI palsy:

Neonatal esotropia with an obvious unilateral abduction deficit
Neonatal esotropia with no obvious unilateral abduction deficit.

Acquired CN VI palsy may be due to varied aetiology:
Benign recurrent CN VI palsy in children may occur after benign acute viral sickness or immunisation. This is an isolated condition with acute onset, and is associated with restriction of abduction.
Patients with vasculopathy present with sudden onset, painless horizontal diplopia. These patients typically show spontaneous and complete resolution within three to six months.
Patients with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) may present with unilateral or bilateral symptoms of headache, visual obscuration, or profound loss of vision.
Intracavernous carotid artery dissection or aneurysm may produce painful CN VI palsy along with ipsilateral Horner syndrome.
Painful CN VI palsy may be present in mastoiditis and petrositis complicating chronic otitis media. A tumour in this region may produce a combined trigeminal-abducens-facial nerve syndrome.
CN VI palsy may be associated with involvement of seventh or eighth cranial nerves.
In unilateral CN VI, four to sixteen prism dioptres of hyperdeviation may be present due to vertical strabismus in children such as dissociated vertical deviation, superior oblique palsy, or physiological hyperphoria.

Differential diagnosis

Duane syndrome: Duane syndrome, a congenital condition due to misdirected third cranial nerve innervation of lateral rectus, may simulate CN VI palsy.
Möbius syndrome: Möbius syndrome is a congenital bilateral CN VI nerve palsy along with seventh cranial nerve palsy.
Wernicke encephalopathy: Wernicke encephalopathy resulting from thiamine depletion may produce features of inability to abduct eyes like bilateral CN VI palsy.
Myasthenia gravis: Clinical features and tests may distinguish Myasthenia gravis, from CN VI palsy.
Traumatic fracture of medial orbital wall with medial rectus entrapment: Traumatic fracture of medial orbital wall with medial rectus entrapment may produce restrictive esotropia.
Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy: Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, mainly affecting medial rectus muscle may also produce restrictive esotropia.
Orbital tumour: Orbital tumour may also produce restrictive esotropia.","Like other cranial nerve palsies, root cause of palsy should be treated. 
Microvascular ischaemia/vasculopathy secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension may lead to Isolated CN VI palsy.

Observation
Patient should be observed for three to six months. Most cases resolve on their own within three to six months.

Therapies vary from controlling vasculopathic risk factors to neurosurgical interventions.
Medical therapy

Prismatic glasses: Cases of non-healing CN VI palsy may be prescribed with prismatic spectacles, and is most effective in cases with some preserved function of the nerve.
Amblyopia therapy: Prescribed standard amblyopia therapy should be instituted. A small face turn adopted by children is beneficial and should be encouraged. Loss of head posture with esotropia indicates loss of fusion and probability of subsequent development of amblyopia.


Surgical therapy

Muscle splitting surgery: Parts of superior and inferior rectus muscle are split and are attached to provide function of new abducting extraocular muscle.


Unmanageable cases of complete CN VI palsy may be patched to avoid diplopia. Patching each eye alternately for a few hours each day, may be done to prevent amblyopia in the affected eye.

Prognosis
Prognosis varies with aetiology. Cases due to vasculopathy usually resolve completely. Other CN VI cases have guarded prognosis. Patients are normally observed for six months for spontaneous resolution."
Blindness,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/blindness,"Visual impairment is when a person has sight loss that cannot be fully corrected using glasses or contact lenses.
Blindness as defined by national programme for control of blindness (NPCB) under following headings:

Inability of a person to count fingers from a distance of 6 meters or 20 feet (technical definition)
Vision 6/60 or less with the best possible spectacle correction
Diminution of field vision to 20 feet or less in better eye

There are two main categories of visual impairment:

Being partially sighted or sight impaired – where the level of sight loss is moderate
Severe sight impairment (blindness) – where the level of sight loss is so severe that activities that rely on eyesight become impossible.

Types of Blindness:
Economic blindness:Inability of a person to count fingers from a distance of 6 meters or 20 feet technical Definition
Social blindness:Vision 3/60 or diminution of field of vision to 10°
Manifest blindness:Vision 1/60 to just perception of light
Absolute blindness:No perception of light
Curable blindness:That stage of blindness where the damage is reversible by prompt management e.g. cataract
Preventable blindness:The loss of blindness that could have been completely prevented by institution of effective preventive or prophylactic measures e.g. xerophthalmia, trachoma and glaucoma
Avoidable blindness:The sum total of preventable or curable blindness is often referred to as avoidable blindness.
National Programme for Control of Blindness

Pre-operative, Operative and Post-operative precautions for Eye Surgery",No Symptoms.,"Blindness can be caused due to numerous conditions, the leading causes are:
The leading causes of chronic blindness include cataract, refractive errors, glaucoma, corneal opacities, age-related macular degeneration, trachoma, childhood blindness and diabetic retinopathy.
Cataract is the opacification of the lens in the eye and in advanced cases a whitish reflex can be seen in the eye. The most important symptom is painless progressive blurring of vision.
Refractive errors occur when the rays of light entering the eye do not focus onto the retina, the part of the eye on which the image forms. This is a very important cause of poor vision in children.
Glaucoma occurs when the pressure of the eye is increased and that causes progressive loss of sight. It is very important to identify and treat glaucoma as the vision lost is irreversible.
In corneal opacities the clear part of the eye in the front through which the light enters the eye becomes opaque and the patient cannot see.
The type of partial vision loss may differ, depending on the cause:

With cataracts, vision may be cloudy or fuzzy, and bright light may cause glare.
With diabetes, vision may be blurred, there may be shadows or missing areas of vision and difficulty seeing at night.
With glaucoma, there may be tunnel vision and missing areas of vision.
With macular degeneration, the peripheral (side) vision is normal but the central vision is slowly lost.","There are two main areas that are looked at when someone's vision is measured:

Visual acuity– It is central vision and is used to look at objects in detail, such as reading a book or watching television.
Visual field– It is the ability to see around the edge of vision while looking straight ahead.

Visual field testing
During visual field testing one will be instructed to look straight ahead at a device while lights are flashed on and off in peripheral vision. Person will be asked to press a button every time you see a light. This shows any gaps in his field of vision.
Test for visual acuity
A Snellen chart is used to measure visual acuity. It involves reading letters off a chart on which the letters become progressively smaller. This chart is used during a routine eye test.After the test, a score made up of two numbers is given. The first number represents how far away from the chart were able to successfully read the letters on the chart. The second number represents how far away a person with healthy vision should be able to read the chart.
So if you were given a visual acuity score of 6/60, it means you can only read 6 meters away what a person with healthy eyesight can read 60 meters away. The normal eyesight is 6/6.
Partial sight impairment
Partial sight, or sight impairment, is usually defined as:

Having very poor visual acuity (3/60 to 6/60) but having a full field of vision
Having a combination of moderate visual acuity (up to 6/24) and a reduced field of vision or having blurriness or cloudiness in your central vision
Having relatively good visual acuity (up to 6/18) but a lot of your field of vision is missing

Severe sight impairment (blindness)
The legal definition of severe sight impairment (blindness) is when 'a person is so blind that they cannot do any work for which eyesight is essential'.
This usually falls into one of three categories:

Having extremely poor visual acuity (less than 3/60) but having a full field of vision
Having poor visual acuity (between 3/60 and 6/60) and a severe reduction in your field of vision
Having average visual acuity (6/60 or better) and an extremely reduced field of vision","The treatment of blindness depends on the cause of blindness.
Blindness due to nutritional defificiency:It can be addressed by dietary changes.
Visual impairment due to refractive error: It can be addressed by doing a refraction and providing appropriate spectacles.
Inflammatory and infectious causes of blindnesscan be treated with medication in the form of drops or pills.
Most of people are blind due to cataract:In these patients, cataract surgery would, in most cases, restore their sight.Usually anintraocular lens (IOL)is implanted in the eye after removal of the opaque natural lens."
Breast Cancer / Carcinoma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/reproductive-system/female-gynaecological-diseases-/breast-cancer-carcinoma,"Cancer that forms in tissues of the breast is usually the ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) and lobules (glands that make milk). It occurs in both men and women, although male breast cancer is rare.Breast cancer is the top cancer in women both in the developed and the developing world.
There are various forms of cancers like:
Ductal Carcinomas: Cancer originating from ducts.
Lobular carcinomas: Cancer originating from lobules.","The most noticeable symptoms are lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. Other than a lump, there may include:

Thickening of breast one breast becoming larger or lower
Nipple changing position or shape or becoming inverted
Skin puckering or dimpling
A rash on or around a nipple
Discharge from nipple/s with constant pain in part of the breast or armpit
Swelling beneath the armpit or around the collarbone","The exact reason for the breast cancer is not known but risks factors associated with the disease are:

Age: The risk of developing cancer increases with age. It has been seen that breast cancer is most common in the women over 50 who have been through menopause.
Levels of estrogen: When the body is exposed to high levels of estrogen. This may happen due to early start of periods and late menopause. Also not having children or having children at later age may also increase the risk of developing breast cancer as body is exposure to estrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy.
Family history: If there is a history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in the family, there may be higher risk of developing breast cancer. Particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It is possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. Third gene (TP53) is also associated with increased risk of breast cancer.
Alcohol: The risk of developing breast cancer is also associated with the amount of alcohol one drinks.
Smoking: The risk of smoking is associated with breast cancer
Radiation: Certain medical procedures that use radiation, such as X-rays and CT scans, may slightly increase risk of developing breast cancer.","Contact your physician: If there is any kind of symptoms like lump or change in shape or color of breast. Than you should contact your physician.
Imaging: Mammography and breast ultrasound scan are also used to diagnose the breast cancer. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. The image produced will show any lumps or abnormalities present in your breasts. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.
Microscopic analysis: A biopsy is generally done when mammograms and other imaging tests, or the physical exam finds a breast change (or abnormality) that is possibly cancer. A biopsy is the only way to tell if cancer is really present.","The main treatments required for breast cancer are:

Surgery: Surgery involves physical removal of the tumor, typically along with some of the surrounding tissue.
Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy is given after surgery to the region of the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes, to destroy microscopic tumor cells that may have escaped surgery.
Chemotherapy: Generally given in stage 2 and 4 of disease, being particularly beneficial in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease. They are given in combinations, usually for 3–6 months."
Bronchitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/respiratory-tract/bronchitis,"Bronchitis is an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the bronchi (the larger and medium-sized airways that carry airflow from the trachea into the more distal parts of the lung parenchyma). Bronchitis can be divided into:

Acute
Chronic

Acute bronchitis is characterized by the feeling of cough or small sensation in the back of the throat. It can be with or without the sputum (mucus that is expectorated, or ""coughed up"", from the respiratory tract). Acute bronchitis is one of the most common types of lung infection. It can occur at any age.
Chronic bronchitis a type of COPD, which involves a cough that produces sputum for 3 months for 2 consecutive years.","The main symptom of bronchitis is persistent cough with thick yellow gray mucous, though it may not always be present. Other symptoms of bronchitis may include:

A tight feeling in chest
Breathlessness
Wheezing
Sore throat
Slight fever and chills
Headache
Blocked nose and sinuses
Body ache and pains","The bronchitis can be caused by either a virus or bacteria, though viral bronchitis is much more common. In most cases, bronchitis is caused by the same viruses that cause the common cold or influenza (flu).
Bronchitis can also be caused by breathing irritant substances, such as smog, chemicals in household products or tobacco smoke.However, Smoking is the main cause of chronic (long-term) bronchitis and it can affect people who are passive smokers as well as smokers themselves.","When symptoms like cough persist for more than 2 weeks, one should need to visit the doctor.
Also chest X-ray is done to confirm for the infection.","For Acute Bronchitis:

Take rest
Drink plenty of fluids
Headaches and body aches can be treated with pain relievers like Paracetamol or Ibuprofen. The Ibuprofen not to be taken by patients of asthma.
Stop smoking or inhaling irritant

For chronic bronchitis:
There is no cure for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but management can help slow the progression of the condition and reduce the symptoms. If one smoke, the best way to prevent COPD from getting quickly worse is to stop smoking and avoid further damage to lungs."
Brucellosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/brucellosis,"Brucellosis
Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease (any disease or infection that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans and vice-versa is classified as a zoonotic disease).It is also known as “undulant fever”, “Mediterranean fever” or “Malta fever” . Brucellosis is a disease of mainly cattle, swine, goats, sheep and dogs.
The infection is transmitted to humans by animals through direct contact with infected materials like afterbirth or indirectly by ingestion of animal products and by inhalation of airborne agents. Consumption of raw milk and cheese made from raw milk (fresh cheese) is the major source of infection in man. It is also an occupational disease for people who work in the livestock sector. It affects people of all age groups and of both sexes.","Initial symptoms include; fever, weakness, malaise, anorexia, headache, pain in muscles and joint and/or back, fatigue.
Some signs and symptoms may persist for longer period are-
Recurrent fever, arthritis, swelling of the testicle and scrotal area, swelling of the heart (endocarditis), chronic fatigue, depression, swelling of the liver and/or spleen.
Complications may affect any organ system.","Brucellosis is caused by different species of bacteria Brucella such as Brucella abortus,Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis, Brucella canis. They are shed in large numbers in the urine, milk and placental fluid of infected animals.
The infection is transmitted to humans by animals through three different ways-

Infection may occur with direct contact with infected materials like afterbirth, blood, urine through broken skin, mucus membrane or   conjunctiva.
Infection may takes place indirectly by ingestion of animal products such as raw milk and cheese made from raw milk. It is the major source of infection in humans.
Infection may also spread by inhalation of airborne agents.

Brucella spp. can survive for long periods in dust, dung, water, slurry, aborted fetuses, soil, meat and dairy products.
Human-to-human transmission is very rare.
Incubation period is highly variable. Usually 2-4 weeks, can be 1 week to 2 months or longer.","The clinical picture is not specific therefore diagnosis needs to be supported by laboratory tests.
Presumptive diagnosis 

Rose Bengal test (RBT) for screening; positive tests to be confirmed by one of the tests mentioned below under Confirmatory diagnosis below;
Standard agglutination test (SAT).

Confirmatory diagnosis 

Isolation of Brucella spp. from blood or other clinical specimen.
A presumptive laboratory diagnosis based on detection of agglutinating antibodies (RBT, SAT) combined with detection of non-agglutinating antibodies through:
ELISA IgG test,
Coombs IgG.","Antibiotics are used to treat the infection and prevent the recurrence of disease. Longer courses of therapy may be needed if there are complications.
For further treatment seek medical advice."
Bedsores,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/bedsores,"Bedsores are also called pressure sores or pressure ulcers . Bedsores are injuries to skin and underlying tissues resulting from prolonged pressure on the skin. Bedsores generally develop on skin that covers bony areas of the body, such as heels, ankles, hips or buttocks.
Most people at risk of bedsores are those with a medical condition, that limits their ability to change position, requires them to use a wheelchair or confines them to bed for prolonged periods.
Bedsores can develop quickly and are often difficult to treat. Several care strategies can help prevent some bedsores and promote healing.","Symptoms of a bedsores are:

Red skin that worsens over time.
Appearance of blister.
open sore

Pressure sores most commonly occur on:

Ankles
Back of head
Back
Buttocks
Elbow
Hips
Heels
Shoulders

Pressure sores are categorized as deep tissue injury which may be purple or maroon. Bedsores may be an area of skin or blood-filled blister, caused due to damage of soft tissue from pressure. The area around may be sore, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer, or cooler compared with tissue nearby.","Pressure on the skin leads to reduced blood flow to the area. Without enough blood skin dies, leading to formation of ulcer.

One may get a bed sore if :

One uses a wheelchair or is bed ridden for a long time.
If one cannot move certain parts of body without help because of a spine or brain injury or disease such as multiple sclerosis.
One is suffering from disease that affects blood flow, including diabetes or vascular disease.
One has Alzheimer's disease or other condition that affects mental status.
Have fragile skin
Have urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence
Lack of nutrition or malnourishment.","If one is bedridden or wheelchair, observe for signs of bedsores. The severity of skin breakdown may be categorized as follows:
Stage 1: Abnormal redness of skin. Skin is intact. This stage is reversible.
Stage 2: The redness progresses to an abrasion, blister, or shallow crater. This stage is also reversible.
Stage 3: A crater-like sore or ulcer that has begun to extend beneath the skin. This stage may be life-threatening.
Stage 4: Skin loss with extensive destruction or damage to muscle, bone, or supporting structures such as tendons or joint capsules. This stage may be fatal.","The treatment of bedsores depends on the severity (i.e. the stage) of the wound. Depending on the severity, a variety of approaches may be used to promote healing. They include synthetic dressings, saline dressings, acetic acid compresses, and various antibiotic dressings (bedsores are particularly prone to infection).
For more severe wounds, surgery may be necessary to remove areas of dead skin. The most important step in both treatment and prevention of bedsores is relieving pressure by frequent repositioning."
Back Pain,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/back-pain,"Acute or short term back pain lasts for few days to few weeks. It usually feels like an ache, strain or rigidity in the back. Chronic back pain persists for more than 3 weeks.
The pain is generally triggered by improper posture while sitting or standing, bending awkwardly, or lifting incorrectly. Back pain is not generally caused by a serious condition and, in most cases, it gets better within 1-2 weeks. It can be treated by taking painkillers.","Upper or middle back pain
Upper or middle back pain can occur anywhere from the base of neck to the bottom of rib cage. Upper and middle back pain is less common than lower back pain as bones in this area of back are not as flexible as those in lower back and neck.Upper or middle back pain often causes a dull, burning, or sharp pain. Symptoms like:

Weakness in arms or legs
A numb or tingling sensation in arms, legs, chest, or abdomen (stomach area)

Lower back pain
The pain will often only affect the lower back. The pain can:

Increase suddenly after lifting something heavy or twisting back awkwardly
It can develop gradually as a result of poor posture.
Occasionally, it may occur for no apparent reason.
The pain may be worse at night, during activity, or after sitting in the same position for a long time, such as after a long car journey. Sometimes, lying down flat may help ease the pain.

The other forms of back pain:

Painful stiffness of the shoulder, which makes it difficult to dress, drive or sleep, may be a sign of frozen shoulder.
Pain in the joints (including the back) during walking and stiffness in the morning are symptoms of arthritis.
Lower back pain, buttock pain, neck pain and stiffness and pain in the sacroiliac joint (the joint that connects the pelvis to the spine) are all possible symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis.
Neck pain and stiffness, headaches and lower back pain following an accident are common symptoms of whiplash.
Pain in lower back that moves down the buttocks into one or both of legs may be a symptom of sciatica.
Soreness in lower back, muscle weakness and tight muscles may be caused by a slipped disc. If someone have a slipped disc, the pain usually radiates down the leg.","Bending for long periods
lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling incorrectly
Twisting
Over-stretching
Driving in a curved position or driving for long periods without taking a break
Overuse of the muscles, usually due to sport or repetitive movements

Risks factors include:

Pregnancy
Overweight or obese
Weakness Bones
Stress
Depression","Most cases of back pain do not require medical attention and can be treated with painkillers and self-care. The physical examination will usually assess your capacity to sit, stand, walk and lift your legs, as well as testing the range of movement in your back.","Pain relievers: Paracetamol and NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen etc are effective pain killers during back pain.
Hot and cold treatment: Hot bath or a hot water bottle placed on the affected area helps ease the pain. Cold treatment such as an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables, placed on the painful area is also effective.
Relaxing: Trying to relax is a crucial part of easing the pain because muscle tension caused by worrying about your condition can make things worse.
Exercise:A normal regime should involve up to eight sessions over a period of up to 12 weeks. It should be in group supervised by a qualified instructor. The classes may include exercises to strengthen muscles and improve posture."
Bell's Palsy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/bell-s-palsy,"Bell's palsy is a form of facial paralysis resulting from a dysfunction of the cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve) causing temporary weakness of the muscles on one side of the face. Symptoms vary from person to person. It is of following types:
Partial palsy: That is mild muscle weakness
Complete palsy: There is no movementat all (though very rare)","Irritation of the affected eye, such as dryness or increased tear production
Pain underneath the ear on the affected side of the face
Drooling from the mouth on the affected side of the face
Dryness of the mouth
Difficulty in eating or drinking
Impaired speech
Weakness or paralysis in one side of the face, which may make it difficult to close the eyelid and cause the side of the mouth to droop
An altered or reduced sense of taste
Increased sensitivity to sound in the affected ear
Pain around the jaw
Headache
Dizziness","Virus:

The herpes virus is common cause of inflammation of the facial nerve.
The herpes simplex virus (HSV), including either herpes type 1 (HSV-1) which causes cold sores or herpes type 2 (HSV-2) which causes genital herpes.
The varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles.

Facial Nerve:

The facial nerve (VII) passes through a narrow gap of bone near the upper jaw on its way from the brain to the face. If the facial nerve is compressed or swollen it can interfere with the signals that brain sends to the muscles of the face.
This interference can restrict the blood and oxygen supply to nerve cells and cause the facial weakness or paralysis that is characteristic of Bell's palsy.","There is no specific test to diagnose Bell’s palsy. Symptoms associated with the bell's palsy help physician to determine the disease.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): It is used to determine the cause of the pressure on facial nerve. MRI scans use radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce a detailed image of the inside of body.
Computerized tomography (CT) scan: It is also be used to detect other causes of symptoms, such as an infection or tumor. A facial CT scan may also be carried out to rule out facial fractures.
Electromyography (EMG): It is a very thin needle electrode that is inserted through the skin into the muscle. A machine called an oscilloscope is then used to measure the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves. The information provided by an EMG can be used to assess the extent of any nerve damage.","Pain relievers: Paracetamol and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen etc. are effective pain killers.
Hot and cold treatment: Hot bath or a hot water bottle placed on the affected area helps ease the pain. Cold treatment such as an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables, placed on the painful area is also effective.
Relaxing: Trying to relax is a crucial part of easing the pain because muscle tension caused by worrying about condition can make things worse.
Medication: Corticosteroids like Prednisolone helps in reducing inflammation (swelling), which should also help to speed up your recovery.
Physiotherapy: Physiotherapist will teach facial exercises that help in strengthening the muscles in the face to improve their co-ordination and range of movement."
Brain Tumour,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/brain-tumour,"Brain tumour is an abnormal or uncontrolled growth of cells found in the brain. In a healthy human body, normal cells grow old or die and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. Some unnecessary new cells are produced when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The formation of these extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumour. There are two main types of tumours which are called benign tumours (harmless growth) and malignant (cancerous tumours).
Brain tumour is a deadly disease. However, it can be treated by various methods but majority of patients die within 9-12 months and less than 3% survive more than 3 years.
Cancerous tumours can be divided into primary brain tumours that start within the brain, and secondary brain tumours that originate from somewhere else, but spread throughout the body, known as brain metastasis tumours.
There are many types of primary brain tumours. They are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they are found or begin. For example, if the brain tumour begins in glial cells it is called glioma. Similarly there are other types depending upon the part of brain in which the tumour originates.



Some Facts about Brain tumour

Brain tumour can occur at any age.
The exact cause of brain tumour is not clear.
Genetic factors play an important role .The role of radiation hazard is not yet established.
The symptoms of brain tumour depend on their size, type, and location.
The most common type of primary brain tumour among adults are astrocytoma, meningioma, and oligodendroglioma.
The most common type of primary brain tumours in children are medulloblastoma, grade I or II astrocytoma (or glioma), ependymoma, and brain stem glioma.
Brain tumours are diagnosed , based on medical history, physical examination and various specialised Tests.
Options for brain tumour treatment include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination thereof.","The most common symptoms of brain tumour are:

Headache (usually worse in the morning)
Nausea and vomiting
Changes in speech, vision, or hearing
Problems in balancing or walking
Changes in mood, personality, or ability to concentrate
Problems with memory
Muscle jerking or twitching (seizures or convulsions)
Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs
Abnormal fatigue and weariness

Symptoms of tumour are associated with the position they present.
Each part of our brain control particular function , so a tumour can affect a specific area of the brain, thereby affecting its normal function . Some of the symptoms, according to their position, are as follows:
Brain stem:

Lack of co-ordination when walking
Double vision
Difficulty in swallowing and speaking
Facial weakness – one-sided smile 
Eyelid weakness - Difficulty in closing eye

Cerebellum:

Flickering, involuntary movement of the eyes
Vomiting and stiffness of the neck
Uncoordinated walking and speech

Temporal lobe:

Speech difficulties and memory problems.
Strange sensations – fear, blackouts, strange smells

Occipital lobe:
Gradual loss of vision on one side
Parietal lobe:

Problems with reading, writing or simple calculations
Difficulty in navigating one's way around
Numbness or weakness in one side of the body
Difficulty in understanding words or speaking

Frontal lobe:

Unsteadiness and weakness on one side of body
Changes in personality
Loss of smell","There is no specific cause of brain tumour. Mutation of certain genes is thought to be the main cause of some types of tumour. The role of radiation caused by gadgets like mobile phones in causing various types of cancers including brain tumour is widely debated. However, this fact has not yet been proven. Research into this field is ongoing. Brain tumours, like other tumours, are not infectious and can't be passed on to other people.","Based on history, symptoms, physical and neurological examination, techniques like MRI, CT scan, angiogram or spinal tap may assist in diagnosis.

Neurologic exam:It includes testing of vision, hearing, alertness, muscle strength, coordination, and reflexes. Eyes are looked for swelling, caused by a tumour pressing on the nerve that connects the eye and the brain.
Angiogram:It is an imaging technique in which dye is injected into the bloodstream. If a tumour is present, the image may show the tumour or blood vessels that are feeding into the tumour.
Spinal tap:For diagnosis, sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that fills the spaces in and around the brain and spinal cord) is usually collected by a technique called lumbar puncture. For this process, a long, thin needle is used to remove fluid and it takes about 30 minutes.
MRIandCTscan are very useful imaging techniques in the diagnosis of brain tumour.","The treatment of brain tumour depends upon the type, grade, and position of tumour and general health of patient.
Some treatment options for brain tumours are as follows:-

Surgery:Surgery is usually the first step in the treatment of both benign and primary malignant brain tumours. This is performed on patient to remove maximum tumour so as to maintain neurological function.
Radiotherapy:High energy beams of radiation focus on cancerous tissue to stops them from multiplying.
Chemotherapy:Chemotherapy is a treatment where anti-cancer drugs are used to kill cancer cells, or to stop them from multiplying. 
Steroids:Steroids are commonly used for reduction and prevention of inflammation around a brain tumour. 
Anti-seizure medication: This is recommended for patients suffering from seizures.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (Also called a VP shunt):A VP shunt may be placed in the head to drain excess fluid from inside the brain thereby helping to control the pressure. 
Encourage supportive care:Encourage supportive carefor the patients suffering from brain tumour such as physical therapy, spiritual care and counselling to improve the quality of life."
Benign Essential Blepharospasm,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/benign-essential-blepharospasm,"Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is an idiopathic disorder of progressive involuntary spasms of orbicularis oculi and upper facial muscles leading to closure of eyelids. BEB is a bilateral condition and a form of focal dystonia (repetitive involuntary sustained muscle contraction) characterised by episodic contraction of protractor (drawing a part forward) muscles (orbicularis oculi, procerus and corrugator superciliaris) and is not associated with another disease. Severe blepharospasm may temporarily make patient functionally blind. Blepharospasm may be precipitated by factors such as reading, bright light, driving or stress and alleviated by talking, relaxation or walking.
BEB should be differentiated from blepharospasm that can exist as part of specific condition (secondary blepharospasm) such as:-
Meige’s syndrome: Meige’s syndrome is characterised by blepharospasm with involvement of the lower facial and neck muscles.
Breughel’s syndrome: Breughel’s syndrome (oromandibular dystonia) is association of blepharospasm with severe mandibular and cervical muscle involvement.
Extrapyramidal disorders: Systemic disease such as extrapyramidal disorders may be present with blepharospasm.
Reflex blepharospasm: Reflex blepharospasm may be secondary to irritation of ocular surface.","Benign essential blepharospasm may have following symptoms:-
Symptoms preceding diagnosis are:-

Watering of eyes.
Intolerance of light.
Vague ocular pain.

Early symptoms of blepharospasm are:-

Increased rate of blinking.
Eyelid spasms.
Irritation of eyes.
Midfacial or lower facial spasm.
Brow spasm.
Eyelid Tic (habitual spasmodic muscular contraction).","Exact cause of benign essential blepharospasm is not known.
Some evidence using functional neuroimaging studies, suggests dysfunction within basal ganglia.
Rarely, genetics play a role in some cases. Some patients with blepharospasm have at least one first degree relative with some form of focal dystonia. Rarely, it may be inherited as an autosomal dominant condition.
Risk factors:

Variable risk factors are there for blepharospasm such as:-
Injury to head or face.
Reflex blepharospasm may be triggered by filamentary keratitis, intraocular inflammation, severely dry eyes, blepharitis, or light sensitivity.
Stress.
Family history of dystonia or tremor.


Blepharospasm may be associated with the use of medications such as:-

Benzodiazepines: Prolonged use or acute withdrawal of benzodiazepines.
Dopaminergic drugs: Use of dopaminergic drugs e.g. in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
Antihistaminics: Use of antihistaminics as in nasal decongestants.
Sympathomimetic drugs.


Comorbid conditions:
Conditions which may occur together with BEB are:-

Dry eyes.
Some patients have blepharitis and keratoconjunctivitis.
Other neurologic disorders:-
Parkinson’s disease.
Parkinson plus syndromes e.g. supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration.
Huntington’s disease
Cerebral diplegia.

In normal blinking, eyelid closure results due to the activity and co-inhibition of two groups of muscles, the protractors of the eyelid and the voluntary retractor of the eyelids (e.g. levator palpebrae superioris, frontalis muscle). During normal blink, protractors and retractors function at separate times, so that on activation of protractor muscles, there is inhibition of retractors. In blepharospasm, this inhibition between protractors and retractors is lost.","Diagnosis of BEB is made clinically (based on history and physical examination) and it is a diagnosis of exclusion by ruling out the presence of associated conditions.
Clinical features:
Benign Essential Blepharospasm:
At onset of BEB, there is increased frequency of blinking precipitated by stimuli such as wind, sunlight, noise, air pollution, reading, watching television, stress, or movement of eye or head. Patients may develop sensory tricks (‘geste antagoniste’) to relieve symptoms such as tics and movements of other muscles innervated by facial nerve e.g. whistling, coughing, eating, picking teeth, yawning or chewing gum.
Eyelid spasm, a characteristic feature of blepharospasm, sets in a few months to years after early features. Blepharospasm is unilateral to begin with but usually eventually evolves into a bilateral condition. Blepharospasm usually lasts for minutes to hours together. Blepharospasm has a variable course and may be intermittent or continuous. It is slowly progressive in most of the patients.
Excessive blinking may lead to unilateral mild twitches, but may progress to bilateral, frequent and forceful spasms. During severe episodes, patient is unable to open the eyelids which may be associated with severe pain and functional blindness and may interfere with daily routine activities. Severe blepharospasm may cause high level of distress and psychosocial impairment causing anxiety, depression, avoidance of social contact and occupational problems. Blepharospasm reduces while concentrating on a specific task or during sleep.
Blepharospasm may be associated with apraxia (loss of ability to perform activity) of eyelid opening i.e. inhibition of proper functioning of levator palpebrae superioris muscle. Apraxia is especially common in parkinsonian disorders.
Secondary blepharospasm: 

Meige’s syndrome: Meige’s syndrome may be associated with facial grimacing due to facial dystonia.
Breughel’s syndrome: Breughel’s syndrome is a dystonia of motor trigeminal nerve which produces widely open mouth. There is paroxysmal hyperpnoea (increased depth of breathing) and upbeating nystagmus.
Extrapyramidal disorders: Patients with extrapyramidal disorders may show other abnormal movements such as tics or cogwheel rigidity of neck and extremities.
Reflex blepharospasm: Reflex blepharospasm may occur due to dry eye or ocular irritation from light.


Conditions relieving blepharospasm:
These include:-

Sleep.
Relaxation.
Inferior gaze.
Artificial tears.
Traction on eyelids.
Talking.
Singing.
Humming.
Solving crossword.
Doing maths.
Solving puzzles.

Anatomic changes associated with long-standing blepharospasm may be:

Ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid in relation to eyeball): Ptosis of the upper eyelid may occur due to attenuation and disinsertion of levator palpebrae superioris aponeurosis (broad sheetlike tendon).
Eyebrow ptosis (drooping): Eyebrow ptosis may result from weakened fascial support caused by longstanding spasm, leading to stretching of fascia.
Dermatochalasis: Dermatochalasis is defined as excess of skin in eyelid and is produced by stretching of skin due to blepharospasm.
Skin excoriation: Skin excoriation is produced secondary to manual attempts by patient to open lids.
Entropion: Blepharospasm may lead to spastic entropion.
Canthal tendon abnormalities: Stretching of medial and lateral canthal tendons may produce horizontal lid laxity and therefore, may cause entropion or ectropion of lower lids. Stretching may produce lid fissures also.
Phimosis (short and narrow) of palpebral fissure (opening between eyelids): Bepharospasm may lead to phimosis of palpebral fissure.


Blepharospasm may be differentiated from conditions like:

Ocular myokymia: Ocular myokymia is characterised by spontaneous, fine fascicular contractions of orbicularis oculi muscle without muscular weakness or atrophy. Eyelid myokymia is typically unilateral and it commonly involves lower eyelids.
Secondary to meningeal irritation.
Facial tics or Tourette syndrome: Facial tics are repetitive stereotyped movements or vocalisations such as blinking, sniffing, facial movements or tensing of abdominal muscles.
Hemifacial spasms (contraction of one side of face): It usually begins as fasciculations of periocular orbicularis and surrounding muscles, which spreads to involve lower facial muscles innervated by facial nerve. Spasms are myoclonic, involuntary, aggravated by stress and may persist during sleep. Hemifacial spasm may lead to facial weakness.
Focal seizures.","Management should be under medical supervision.
Currently, there is no cure for BEB and the disease frequently progresses despite treatment.
General measures:

Sunglasses: Wearing tinted sunglasses with ultraviolet blocking may help in decreasing painful light sensitivity in those who show significant photosensitivity.
Lid hygiene: Lid hygiene may decrease eye irritation. Those having blepharitis also show improvement.
Artificial tears: Application of artificial tears and punctal occlusion to alleviate dry eyes may improve blepharospasm.


Medical therapy:

Botulinum A toxin: Subcutaneous Botulinum A toxin injected along upper and lower eyelid and eyebrow gives temporary relief. The toxin interferes with transmitter acetylcholine release from nerve terminals and cause paralysis of injected muscle. Botulinum A toxin is derived from anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria named Clostridium botulinum.

Surgical management:
Surgical management of BEB is usually reserved for patients who are unresponsive or cannot tolerate to botulinum injections.
Surgery can be:

Myectomy: Myectomy involves removal of protractor orbicularis oculi muscle.
Extended myectomy: Extended myectomy involves removal of protractor orbicularis oculi, procerus and corrugator supercilliaris muscles."
Blepharitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/blepharitis,"Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margins. It is a common disorder affecting external eye, the cause for which is unclear, although seborrhoea and staphylococcal infection play important roles.
Chronic blepharitis may cause secondary changes in the cornea and conjunctiva, and many patients have associated tear film instability. This condition may interfere with contact lens wear and aggravate treatment of dry eyes.
While generally not sight- threatening, it may permanently damage eyelid margin.
Blepharitis may be divided into:
Anterior blepharitis: 
Anterior blepharitis affects eyelid skin, root of eyelashes and eyelash follicles. It is divided into:-
- Staphylococcal blepharitis.
- Seborrhoeic blepharitis.

Seborrhoeic blepharitis is more common in older age group. Staphylococcal blepharitis tends to affect younger patients as compared to seborrhoeic blepharitis and may start in childhood.
Posterior blepharitis:
Posterior blepharitis affects meibomian glands and their orifices. It has a range of potential causes, the primary cause being meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). There are three main types:-
- Meibomian seborrhoea.
- Primary meibomitis.
- Meibomitis with secondary blepharitis.
Frequently, there is considerable overlap of these in an individual patient. Seborrhoeic blepharitis may occur in isolation or it may be associated with anterior staphylococcal blepharitis or even posterior blepharitis.
Since bacteria and inflammation are believed to contribute for the disease, long-term management may include eyelid hygiene and use of therapeutic agents which reduce infection and inflammation.
Blepharitis may be associated with diseases such as:
Systemic diseases:
- Acne rosacea.
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis.
Ocular diseases:
- Dry eye syndrome.
- Trichiasis.
- Chalazion.
- Conjunctivitis.
- Keratitis.","The symptoms of various types of blepharitis are similar, although there is frequently little correlation between their severity and the extent of clinical involvement. Many of the symptoms are secondary to tear film abnormality.
Symptoms are frequently worse in the morning and are characterised by exacerbations and remissions.
Symptoms of pure seborrhoeic blepharitis are similar but less severe than those of staphylococcal blepharitis, with less waxing and waning and fewer exacerbations.
Common symptoms are:-
- Burning sensation in eyes.
- Foreign body sensation.
- Eye irritation.
- Watering of eyes.
- Pain in eyes.
- Itching.
- Erythema of lids.
- Crust formation on lid margins and medial canthus with matting of eyelashes.
- Redness of eyes.
- Mild photophobia.
- Blurred or decreased vision.

Systemic diseases may have associated features of disease process:

Acne rosacea may be associated with:
Red and swollen nose (rhinophyma or potato nose).
Easy facial flushing.
Telangiectasia (visibly dilated blood vessels on skin).
Oily skin.
Papules.
Pustules.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis: 
Seborrhoeic skin changes may involve scalp, eyebrows, retro-auricular areas, glabella (smooth area between eyebrows just above the nose) nasolabial folds and sternum.
Seborrhoeic dermatitis may be:

Oily type: In oily type, scaly eruptions are greasy and skin is oily.
Dry type (pityriasis capitis or dandruff): There are scaly eruptions with scalp itching and flaking.","Exact aetiology of blepharitis is complex and not fully understood, though infection and inflammation contribute to the disease.
Acute blepharitis is commonly due to chemical or allergic drug reaction.
Chronic blepharitis may be associated with exposure to smoke, smog, chemical fumes or any other irritant.
Specific causes of blepharitis include:
- Dry eye syndrome: Dry eye is reported to be present in staphylococcal blepharitis, and conversely, patients with dry eye develop staphylococcal blepharitis. It is postulated that a decrease in local lysozyme and immunoglobulin levels with tear deficiency may alter resistance to bacteria, thereby predisposing to staphylococcal blepharitis.

Some patients with seborrhoeic blepharitis and MGD also develop dry eye. This may result from increased tear evaporation due to deficiency in the superficial lipid layer of tears as well as reduced ocular surface sensation.
- Acne rosacea.
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis.
- Parasitic infestations, such as Demodex folliculorum (causes Demodicosis) and Phthiriasis palpebrarum.

Demodex infestation, characterised by cylindrical dandruff like sleeves around eyelashes may be found in patients with chronic blepharitis. Its role is not firmly established since Demodex can be found with nearly same prevalence in asymptomatic patients. However, patients with recalcitrant blepharitis have responded to therapy directed against Demodex mites.
- Herpes simplex dermatitis.
- Varicella-zoster dermatitis.
- Molluscum contagiosum.
- Allergic or contact dermatitis.

Sjögren syndrome may present as blepharitis.
The exact pathogenesis of blepharitis is not known and is suspected to be multi-factorial.
Staphylococcal blepharitis:
The mechanism by which bacteria Staphylococcus aureus cause symptoms of blepharitis is not known. There may be direct irritation from staphylococcal toxins and/or enhanced cell-mediated immunity to bacteria.
Seborrhoeic blepharitis:
Seborrhoeic blepharitis has less inflammation than staphylococcal blepharitis but has more oily or greasy scaling. Some patients of seborrhoeic blepharitis also show meibomian gland dysfunction.
Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD):
Meibomian gland dysfunction shows abnormalities and altered secretion of meibomian glands. Both altered composition and quantitative deficiency of meibomian gland secretion can contribute to symptoms of blepharitis.","Diagnosis depends upon the clinical presentation and examination of patient by an eye specialist.
Examination of patients with blepharitis shows findings of associated systemic disease such as:-
- Acne rosacea: Rosacea is associated with pustules, telangiectasias, rhinophyma or erythema.
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis: Seborrhoeic dermatitis is characterised by oily skin and flaking from the scalp or eyebrows.
- Herpes simplex: Herpes simplex may show features of erythema and vesicle formation.
Macroscopic examination of eyelids:
Macroscopic gross examination of eyelids shows erythema and crusting of eyelashes and lid margins.
Slit-lamp examination:
Slit-lamp examination may show features like:-
Eyelid changes:-
- Madarosis (loss of eyelashes).
- Poliosis (whitening of the eyelashes).
- Trichiasis (scarring and misdirection of eyelashes).
- Plugging and ‘pouting’ of meibomian orifices.
- Crusting of lashes and meibomian orifices.
- Ulcers on eyelid margins.
- Tylosis (lid irregularity).
- Telangiectasias.
- Entropion.
Conjunctival changes:-
- Papillary injection.
- Loss of normal tarsal vascular architecture.
- Tarsal thickening.
- Conjunctival scarring.
- Cicatricial contraction and distortion of tarsus.

Corneal findings:-
- Punctate epithelial erosions.
- Marginal infiltrates or ulcers.
- Limbitis (limbal inflammation and thickening).
- Peripheral corneal ectasia.
- Pannus.
- Phlyctenule formation.
Tear film break-up time (BUT):
This is the interval between last blink and the appearance of first dry spot.
Fluorescein dye is instilled in the eye and patient blinks to spread it and then stops blinking. Eye is examined under cobalt blue filter. After an interval, appearance of black spot or lines, indicate formation of dry areas. Formation of dry area at same spot shows local corneal abnormality and is ignored. A BUT of less than 10 seconds suggests tear film instability.

Anterior blepharitis:
Anterior blepharitis involves mainly eyelashes and associated oil glands. Various formations of debris adhere to lashes such as:-
- Crusting: Crusting refers to flakes of material that adhere to the lashes and usually represents seborrhoeic disease. Seborrhoeic blepharitis primarily involves anterior lid and is associated with formation of greasy crusts adherent to eyelash.
- Collarette: Collarette is an irregular ring like formation around the base of eyelashes and is seen in staphylococcal blepharitis.
- Sleeve: Sleeve is a smooth tube of material that also surrounds the base of eyelash as seen in Demodex infestation.
- Ulcers: Ulcers form at the base of eyelash. These are covered by a crust of fibrin, which is lifted up with the growth of eyelash shaft.

Corneal disease is most common with staphylococcal blepharitis.
Posterior blepharitis:
Posterior blepharitis causes alterations in secretory metabolism and function of meibomian glands. Meibomian secretions become wax like causing blockage of gland orifices. Stagnant material causes growth of bacteria and leads to inflammation.
- Meibomian seborrhoea: Meibomian seborrhoea is characterised by dilated meibomian glands which produce copious amounts of lipids. This appears on lid margins as small oil globules or as collection of waxy material. Tear film is excessively oily and foamy. In severe cases, secretions collect as a frothy discharge at the inner canthus (meibomian foam). This causes burning sensation on first waking in the morning.

- Primary meibomitis: Primary meibomitis is characterised by diffuse inflammation around meibomian gland orifices. It may be associated with acne rosacea or seborrhoeic dermatitis.

The meibomian gland orifices may show pouting and be capped by domes of oil (meibomana). Meibomian gland secretions may be turbid and contain particulate debris. Firm pressure on tarsal glands show inspissated secretions.

Obliteration of main meibomian ducts may cause secondary cystic dilatation and formation of chalazion (meibomian cyst). In advanced cases, posterior lid margin may show thickening, rounding, vascularisation and notching. There may be secondary changes like papillary conjunctivitis, inferior punctate epitheliopathy and tear film instability.

- Meibomitis with secondary blepharitis: Meibomitis with secondary blepharitis is always associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis. In contrast to primary meibomitis, involvement of meibomian glands is mild and patchy. There is inflammation surrounding the glands and secretions are solidified and are difficult to express. Secondary conjunctival and corneal changes are usually mild. Some patients may have associated tear film instability.
Salient features in general are:-
- Plugging of meibomian glands.
- Inspissated lipid secretions.
- Inflammation of gland orifices.
- Blockage of orifices may cause chalazion formation or hordeolum due to infection.
- Tear film instability.
- Papillary conjunctivitis.

Corneal changes can also result from posterior blepharitis.
Diagnostic procedures:-
There are no specific clinical diagnostic tests for blepharitis, however, following tests may be helpful:-
- Culture from eyelid margins: Culture from eyelid margins may be done for patients with recurrent anterior blepharitis having severe inflammation or who are not responding to treatment.
- Microscopic evaluation: Microscopic evaluation of eyelashes may reveal Demodex mites.
- Biopsy: Biopsy from eyelid may be indicated to exclude the possibility of carcinoma in cases showing marked asymmetry or one with unifocal recurrent chalazion not responding to therapy.
Histological findings:
- Seborrhoeic blepharitis: Seborrhoeic blepharitis shows spongiosis, mild perivascular lymphohistiocytic, mononuclear cellular infiltrates in superficial dermis.
- Staphylococcal blepharitis: Staphylococcal blepharitis is a chronic non-granulomatous inflammation, usually with neutrophils and often shows acanthosis or parakeratosis.

Imaging studies:
- LipiView (Tear science): LipiView (Tear science) allows visualisation of individual meibomian glands in everted inferior tarsal plate and produces semi-quantitative analysis of meibomian gland viability. This also measures incomplete blink rate and thickness of lipid oil layer.
- Keratograph 5M (Oculus): Keratograph 5M (Oculus) may be used to obtain images of meibomian glands.
Blepharitis should be differentiated from conditions like:
- Bacterial infections: Bacterial infections such as impetigo or erysipelas.
- Viral infections: Viral infections like papillomavirus or vaccinia.
- Parasitic infections: Parasitic infections e.g. Phthirus pubis (Pediculosis palpebrarum).
- Dermatoses: Dermatoses such as psoriasis and erythroderma.
- Immunological conditions: Immunological conditions like atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis.
- Benign eyelid tumours: Benign eyelid tumours like actinic keratosis or squamous cell papilloma.
- Malignant eyelid tumours: Malignant eyelid tumours like basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.
- Trauma: Trauma may be mechanical, thermal or produced by radiations.
-Toxic conditions: Toxic condition such as medicamentosa (produced by use of medicines).","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Blepharitis is a chronic condition for which therapy is directed to provide relief in patients who report discomfort or experience visual symptoms.
Pathophysiology of anterior and posterior blepharitis may be different but the treatment options are similar.
General measures:
- Eyelid hygiene: Eyelid hygiene includes warm compresses, eyelid massage and eyelid scrubs with wet washcloth and no tears baby shampoo, help to clear scales and debris.
Medical therapy:
- Topical antibiotics: Topical antibiotics are useful to provide symptomatic relief and in eradicating bacteria from eyelid margin.
- Oral antibiotics: Oral antibiotics are recommended for patients with MGD not controlled with eyelid hygiene or patients with associated rosacea.
- Topical Steroids: Short courses of topical steroids provide symptomatic relief in cases with significant ocular inflammation.
- Topical combined antibiotic and steroid: Topical combination of antibiotic and steroid is useful in cases with coexistent bacterial infection and inflammation.
- Topical artificial tears: Many blepharitis patients have tear film abnormalities. Topical lubrication with artificial tears may improve symptoms when used as an adjunct to eyelid hygiene and medications.
- Topical cyclosporine: In patients with severe blepharitis, topical cyclosporine improve symptoms superior to combined antibiotic and steroid regimen.
Surgical therapy:
Surgical therapy for blepharitis is required only for complications such as trichiasis, chalazion, ectropion, entropion or corneal disease.
Prognosis:
The prognosis for patients with blepharitis is good to excellent. Blepharitis causes significant morbidity in an extremely small subset of patients. For most, it remains more of a symptomatic affliction rather than a true threat to the health and function.
Blepharitis is a chronic condition and has periods of exacerbation and remissions. Patients experience a considerable amount of discomfort and misery that can greatly reduce their well-being and ability to carry out daily activities of life and work. Symptoms may be frequently improved by management through a prolonged program rather than via an instant cure, but it is difficult to eliminate blepharitis. Rarely, severe blepharitis may result in permanent alterations in eyelid margin."
Band Shaped Keratopathy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/band-shaped-keratopathy,"Band Shaped Keratopathy (Calcific band keratopathy, or band keratopathy) is a non-specific corneal condition characterised by chronic deposition of calcium salts (principally hydroxyapatite) within the basement membrane, Bowman’s layer and anterior stromal lamellae of the corneal epithelium (leaving remainder of the cornea clear). Initially, corneal degenerative changes begin near the limbus, either on nasal, temporal or both sides together in exposed palpebral fissure at 3 to 9 o’clock position. Calcific band is concentric with the limbus but is separated from it by a clear zone (representing a lucid interval) due to lack of Bowman’s layer at the periphery, or due to buffering action at the limbus. Keratopathy appears as a superficial greyish-white corneal opacity having frosted or ground glass appearance. The opacity is covered by clear epithelium with lacunae of uninvolved tissue. There are numerous holes where corneal nerves penetrate the Bowman’s layer. The disease progresses toward the corneal center and thickens as well in its anterior and posterior dimensions, resulting in more opaque, whitish surface with increased nodularity. Calcium deposits thicken and may cause breakdown of the overlying epithelium, resulting in the appearance of spontaneous and recurrent corneal epithelial erosions.
Band shaped keratopathy may occur as isolated condition or in association with a variety of disease entities. The corneal involvement is described as band shaped keratopathy because of the band-like distribution of the deposits across the interpalpebral zone. Unlike band shaped keratopathy, calcareous degeneration usually spares the basement and Bowman’s membrane and is characterised by clumps of calcium salts in the superficial and deep stroma.
Patients with keratopathy may remain relatively asymptomatic for a considerable length of time in early stages of the disease, as long as the central visual axis of the cornea remains clear. With progression of the disease, there is diminution of visual acuity and pain in the eyes due to disruption of the corneal epithelium.
Identification of corneal and conjunctival degenerations has improved with the use of confocal microscopy, immuno-histochemical staining and genetic testing.","Patients with band shaped keratopathy are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease.
Patients with band shaped keratopathy may complain of:

Ocular (eye) irritation.
Foreign body sensation.
Diminution of vision.
Lacrimation or watering of eyes.
Pain.
Epithelial defects.
Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light).
Visible plaque in the eye.
Redness (less common).","Numerous mechanisms, whether systemic or local to the eye, by which the balance of the calcium phosphate solubility product are tilted toward abnormal tissue calcification resulting nonspecific finding of band keratopathy. As such, there are many diseases associated with this condition. Though we tend to think first of conditions such as uveitis and systemic hypercalcaemia, in a recent series the most commonly associated causes of calcific band keratopathy were chronic corneal oedema, phthisis bulbi, and even idiopathic cases.
Systemic disease associations:
Hypercalcaemia (elevated serum calcium level) may be due to:

Hyperparathyroidism.
Over treatment for hypoparathyroidism.
Vitamin D intoxication.
Sarcoidosis.
Multiple myeloma.
Paget’s disease.
Milk-alkali syndrome.
End stage renal disease: In end-stage renal disease, elevation of either serum calcium, phosphate, or both may disrupt the equilibrium towards precipitation.
Hypophosphatasia: Hypophosphatasia, an inborn error of metabolism involving decreased alkaline phosphatase activity and resultant hypercalcaemia (less common).
Tumoral calcinosis: Tumoral calcinosis, a rare syndrome characterised by periarticular calcium deposition, has also been reported as a systemic association (less common).

In some cases, reversal of serum hypercalcaemia through treatment of the underlying disease will lead to spontaneous resolution of band keratopathy within a few months.
Hyperuricaemia: Hyperuricaemia may lead to band keratopathy and is differentiated based on clinical history, the golden-brown colour on examination, and elevated uric acid levels.
Heredity: Primary hereditary band keratopathy.

Association with chronic ocular conditions:
Numerous chronic ocular conditions may similarly predispose to the development of calcific band keratopathy such as:

Uveitis (chronic iritis in particular, affiliated with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis). In general, the severity of band keratopathy relates directly to the duration of ocular inflammation, though the specific details of the cause and effect relationship between uveitis and corneal mineralisation remains poorly understood.
Chronic ocular inflammation.
Absolute glaucoma.
Chronic corneal oedema.
Phthisis bulbi.
Interstitial keratitis.
Ocular toxicity: Whereas band keratopathy typically develops over months to years, several of these iatrogenic aetiologies demonstrate rapid onset of the corneal changes. Ocular toxicity may be due to:

- Mercurial preservatives: Degenerative calcium deposition associated with chronic damage from mercurial preservatives in many ophthalmic preparations (e.g. phenyl-mercuric nitrate or thiomersal).
- Topical steroid-phosphate preparations.
- Intraocular use of silicone oil.
- Intraocular use of sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulphate: Intraocular use of sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulphate during routine cataract extraction.
The causes of band shaped keratopathy can be broadly divided into six categories:

Chronic inflammation: Chronic keratitis, chronic uveitis of any cause and ocular trauma, along with its accompanying chronic Inflammation, are the most common ocular causes of band shaped keratopathy.
Mercurial preservatives: Degenerative calcium deposition associated with chronic damage from mercurial preservatives in many ophthalmic preparations viz. long-term use of phenyl-mercuric nitrate preserved miotic therapy,or thiomersal containing artificial tears used for severe dry eye.
Hypercalcaemia: Hypercalcaemia secondary to milk alkali syndrome, vitamin D toxicity, sarcoidosis, hyperparathyroidism, lytic lesions affecting the bones, and other systemic diseases.
Raised serum phosphorus levels: Chronic renal failure, uraemia, or other conditions, that may cause a rise in serum phosphorus levels.
Heredity: Primary hereditary band keratopathy.
Silicone oil instillation in an aphakic eye.


Pathogenesis:
Since its first description by Dixon in 1848, much remains elusive regarding the exact pathogenesis of Band keratopathy. It is not clear why the disease typically starts at the limbus with an intervening clear space.
The principal calcium salt deposited in band keratopathy, hydroxyapatite, is a complex crystal composed primarily of calcium and phosphate. The solubility of calcium phosphate in organic tissues in general is quite low and this product exists in a near supersaturated state in blood and interstitial tissue. Disruption of this equilibrium with resultant precipitation of calcium phosphate may readily occur with:

An increase in pH
Increase in local concentration of either ion
Abrupt loss of solvent (e.g. evaporative loss of aqueous tear layer) or
Appearance of calcium phosphate crystal nucleus in near supersaturated tissue.

It is surmised that hypercalcaemia alone was likely not sufficient to produce disease. The suggested possible mechanisms may be:

Abnormalities in the transport and mobilisation of calcium in interstitial fluid: Abnormalities in the transport and mobilisation of calcium in interstitial fluid likely drive deposition.
Dysfunction of the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBCe1): Dysfunction of the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBCe1) in corneal tissues, sufficiently impairs efflux of bicarbonate from the stroma into the aqueous, thereby raising local pH and predisposing to band keratopathy.
Localisation of disease to the interpalpebral fissure: Localisation of disease to the interpalpebral fissure, while unrelated to ultraviolet light exposure, may stem from the local effects of evaporative tear film loss.
Loss of carbon dioxide: Loss of carbon dioxide through diffusion at any exposed mucosal surface would raise local pH and thereby promote deposition. Local pH may explain further the propensity for the crystals to deposit in Bowman’s layer and anterior stromal layers, as deeper corneal lamellae have a lower pH due to lactic acid accumulation from anaerobic glycolysis. It is still not clear whether epithelial basement membrane is structurally more conducive to the sudden precipitation of crystalline calcium phosphate.

Some have asserted that the limbal vasculature may provide a buffer against pH changes, possibly explaining the commonly noted clear interval of uninvolved tissue at the limbus.","Diagnosis of band shaped keratopathy depends upon clinical presentation.
Clinical history:
Patients with band shaped keratopathy are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease. Symptomatic patients should be enquired about the severity and duration of symptoms.
History of systemic disease: 

Any systemic disease causing hyperglycaemia.
Vitamin D intake: Patients should be questioned concerning excessive vitamin D ingestion. Although corneal calcification may be reversible with discontinuation of the vitamin, nephrocalcinosis may still develop.
Joint pains.

History of ocular conditions:

Ocular symptoms like Irritation, foreign body sensation, watering or diminution of vision.
Any history suggestive of chronic uveitis or inflammation of eyes.
Use of topical eye preparations containing steroid phosphate or mercurial preservatives.
Silicone eye injection.
Long standing glaucoma.

Clinical examination:
A general medical workup is advisable in patients with systemic association of the disease.
Examination of eyes should be carried out under slit lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist.

Band shaped keratopathy: Initially, corneal degenerative changes are seen concentric with the limbus, either on nasal, temporal or both sides together in exposed palpebral fissure at 3 to 9 o’clock position. Calcific band is separated from the limbus by a clear zone (representing a lucid interval). Keratopathy appears as a superficial greyish-white corneal opacity resembling frosted or ground glass, with ‘white flecks’ and ‘clear spots’ interspersed within the band, giving it a ‘Swiss cheese’ appearance. The opacity is covered by clear epithelium with lacunae of uninvolved tissue. Later, the disease progresses toward the corneal center and thickens resulting in more opaque, whitish surface with increased nodularity. Thickened calcium deposits may cause breakdown of the overlying epithelium, resulting in the appearance of spontaneous and recurrent corneal epithelial erosions or epithelial defects.
Signs of chronic inflammation or uveitis. 
Signs of long standing glaucoma.
Silicone oil in anterior chamber.

Histopathology:
There is deposition of calcium in epithelial basement membrane, Bowman’s layer and anterior stroma which is characteristically seen as sub-epithelial basophilic granular degeneration in band shaped distribution with haematoxylin and eosin stain (H&amp;E stain). With disease progression, large calcium phosphate granules, with traces of sulphur and silicone, become confluent and hyaline deposits may be appreciable between layers of redundant, calcified Bowman’s membrane. Masses of eosinophilic amorphous connective tissue insinuate themselves between the fragments of calcified Bowman’s layer and the overlying epithelium, and there is patchy calcification of the anterior lamellae of the stroma. Calcium is also deposited in areas where there are signs of fibroblastic proliferation.
Special stains such as alizarin red or von-kossa stain may be used to confirm the findings.
Laboratory diagnosis:
Laboratory diagnosis may include tests to diagnose any systemic association of band shaped keratopathy such as:

Serum calcium and phosphate levels.
Serum parathormone level.
Renal function tests viz. blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.
Angiotensin converting enzyme levels, x-ray or spiral computerised tomography (CT) scan of chest may be done in suspected cases of sarcoid.

Imaging studies:
Imaging studies may help in a search for lytic lesions affecting the bones.

Calcific band keratopathy should be differentiated from:

Primary and secondary calcareous degeneration of cornea.
Spheroidal degeneration or droplet keratopathy which shows band like deposition of hyaline.
Salzmann nodular degeneration.
Blood staining of cornea.
Advanced anterior basement membrane dystrophy of cornea.
Calciphylaxis: Calciphylaxis is a condition of induced ocular and systemic hypersensitivity reaction, characterised by calcium deposition in response to specific antigens or agents. For example, it takes place in children with uveitis or in patients given calciferol.
Topical ciprofloxacin solution particle deposition.
Limbal stem cell deficiency.


Calcific band keratopathy versus calcareous degeneration of the cornea: 
Calcareous degeneration of the cornea usually affects the deep layers as well as the anterior layers. Calcareous degeneration occurs in severely diseased eyes with exposed stroma and vascular compromise or in eyes undergoing multiple operations. It has also been reported in a failed corneal graft. Calcareous degeneration of the cornea as seen in seriously injured eyes, phthisis bulbi, and necrotic neoplasms is often accompanied by bone formation elsewhere in the globe. However, primary calcareous degeneration may occur in the absence of systemic disease or calcium metabolic disturbances. The sub epithelial deposition is bilateral, and occasional bouts of irritation may occur.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Therapeutic goals for the management of band keratopathy are:

To re-establish normal corneal and limbal topography,
To improve visual function if there is potential for it, and
To provide symptomatic relief from recurrent erosions and ulcers.

Ocular therapy is indicated only if the patient is symptomatic.
Distinguishing local and systemic causes of band shaped keratopathy appropriately outlines treatment options and prognosis for the patient. Removal of the inciting agent in iatrogenic cases or correction of the systemic metabolic disturbance may correct the pathology. Correction of the systemic metabolic disturbance may delay recurrence of the disease after treatment. More so, detection of band keratopathy may occasionally uncover a systemic disease which may be life-threatening.
Superficial debridement or lamellar keratectomy in band keratopathy is usually effective in restoring normal vision. Adverse outcomes such as corneal scarring and vision loss may result from the procedure, but the incidence of such complications is low.
General measures:

Diet: Diet may be controlled to prevent excessive absorption and serum elevation of calcium associated with vitamin D intake and milk-alkali syndrome as a measure for band keratopathy.
Topical artificial tears: Topical artificial tears may be used as ocular surface lubricants in patients with mild symptoms of discomfort.

Medical therapy: 
Although medical therapy is ineffective in treating band keratopathy, underlying systemic conditions associated with elevated levels of calcium and phosphate should be treated to prevent recurrence.
Surgical therapy:
The goal of surgery is to remove opaque plaques of calcium, without inducing visually significant stromal scarring.
Prior to surgical management of band keratopathy, it is important to consider:

Visual acuity and future visual potential of the affected eye.
Health and visual function of the contra-lateral eye.
Age, level of cooperation, and family support of patient.
Assurance to the patient about the surgery.
Although final visual acuity is difficult to predict, patient can expect improved visual function.
Patient should be prepared for realistic postoperative goals.
The probability of recurrent corneal disease always exists. Degeneration may recur even bilaterally following corneal transplantation.

Candidates for surgical treatment of band keratopathy are:

Patients with central or paracentral corneal involvement affecting visual function.
Band keratopathy causing recurrent epithelial erosions with pain.

Contraindications to surgery:

Active infectious process such as keratitis: Active infectious process such as keratitis, should be treated first.
Gross lid abnormalities and mal-positions: Any gross lid abnormalities and malpositions (e.g. ectropion, entropion, or severe seborrhoeic blepharitis) should be treated beforehand, since it alleviates wound healing complications in the postoperative period.
Herpes disease: It is advisable to proceed cautiously in patients with known herpetic disease. The surgical trauma and postoperative steroids may reactivate an immunologic response. Perioperative treatment with antivirals acyclovir or valcyclovir is recommended to lessen the risk of disease recurrence.

Surgical procedures:
Superficial debridement: The primary goal of superficial debridement is to clear the visual axis. Superficial debridement of band keratopathy can be performed in a sterile manner in outpatient setting preferably under magnification. Though, any local anaesthesia (e.g. proparacaine) may be used, but cocaine as local anaesthetic facilitates the separation of corneal epithelium from Bowman’s layer. This allows ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA) to work more effectively.
Corneal epithelium is removed with a blunt spatula from the limbus toward the center (out-to-in or centripetal direction). For difficult areas of calcium, a diamond-burr tip on a Fisch drill may be used.
Following the procedure, irrigate the eye thoroughly to remove EDTA solution from the conjunctival surface and fornices. Pressure patch is applied after cyclopentolate and topical steroid-antibiotic drops or ointment.
Neodymium- doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet laser (Nd: YAG laser): Calcific band keratopathy can be treated using an Nd: YAG laser. This technique offers advantages of ease of performance, rapid resolution of the patient symptoms, and a smooth corneal surface. It has fallen out of favour with the advent of Argon fluoride excimer laser.
Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy: Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy may be used to polish the irregular corneal surface to make it smooth, after the plaque has been removed. Excimer laser should not be used to remove calcium in band keratopathy. Attempt to remove band keratopathy with the excimer laser alone may result in significant irregular corneal astigmatism, since the cornea may be ablated preferentially. Excimer laser does not differentiate between normal corneal tissue and calcified lesions. Further, the excimer laser ablates normal tissues at faster rates than calcified or scarred lesions.
Lamellar keratectomy: Lamellar keratectomy may be required for more advanced cases. A lamellar keratectomy involving removal of epithelium, Bowman’s layer, and a portion of the anterior stroma, may be performed in cases in which the corneal surface is thickened irregularly and the area of pathology is fairly extensive. It is accomplished with a blade or rotating diamond burr. Any bleeding from associated corneal neovascularisation or interstitial keratitis requires pressure patching or topical vasoconstrictors.
Anterior segment – optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) or Rotating Scheimpflug imaging technique (measures anterior and posterior corneal surfaces) can help measure the extent of the pathology as well as the expected residual stromal bed.
Bandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens may be used following superficial debridement or lamellar keratectomy. The bandage contact lenses produce significant relief in pain, protect blink disruption of re-epithelialisation, and provide a scaffold for epithelial migration from the limbus.
Amniotic membrane graft: In recalcitrant cases, amniotic membrane graft may be applied to cover and promote healing, particularly when delayed epithelialisation is anticipated, such as in patients with chronic ocular surface inflammation or advanced age.
Amniotic membrane graft can be used as an adjunct therapy after the calcific deposits are surgically or chemically removed. The amniotic membrane graft should include a thick amniotic membrane with basement membrane to promote wound healing and replace the lost basement membrane and stromal matrix. The amniotic membrane should be placed in a ‘’ basement membrane down” orientation so that the basement membrane is in direct contact with the underlying stroma. Amniotic membrane graft is secured with sutures or biocompatible fibrin glue. Graft cannot be used as a sole therapy for band keratopathy.

Prognosis:
Patients with band keratopathy may experience diminution of vision as the deposition progresses across the visual axis. A foreign body sensation and irritation associated with an irregular surface are common symptoms. The ocular discomfort may worsen to the point of becoming disabling, especially as smaller segments of the plaque loosen and become partially mobile. The plaque itself often is visible and of cosmetic concern to the patient and family members.
Unless underlying conditions have been addressed, removing the calcium deposits in band keratopathy will be associated with a high incidence of recurrence. In general, however, superficial debridement or lamellar keratectomy restores vision and comfort for most of the patients with band keratopathy, with the incidence of adverse outcomes following this procedure being very low."
Burns,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/burns,"Burns are a serious public health problem. A burn is defined as an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals.
Heat burns occur when some or all of the different layers of cells in the skin are destroyed by a hot liquid (scald), a hot solid (contact burn) or a flame (flame burn). Skin injuries due to ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity or chemicals, as well as respiratory damage resulting from smoke inhalation, are also considered as burns.
According to WHO estimates about 265 000 deaths occur each year from fires alone globally, with more deaths from scalds, electrical burns, and other forms of burns for which data are not available. The majority of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, with almost half occur in the WHO South-East Asia Region.
In India around 7 million people suffer from burn injuries each year with 1.4 lakh deaths and 2.4 lakh people suffer with disability. Burn death rates have been decreasing in high income countries.
Females and males show similar rates for burns in contrast to other injury patterns where rates of injury are higher in males than females. The higher risk for females is associated with open fire cooking, or unsafe cook stoves, loose clothing. Self-directed or interpersonal violence is also a factor for burn injuries.
Along with adult females, children are also vulnerable to burns. Out of 5 burn victims 4 are women and children. Burns are the fifth most common cause of non-fatal childhood injuries and 11th leading cause of death of children aged 1-9 years. Among all people globally, infants have the highest death rates from burns.
Burns are also a leading cause of morbidity; millions who survive suffer from lifelong disability and disfigurements with resulting emotional trauma and stigma.
Burns are preventable. Increased efforts in prevention and care would lead to significant reduction in burn-related morbidity, mortality and disability.
The National Programme for Prevention, Management and Rehabilitation of Burn Injuries (NPPMRBI) is an initiative by the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India to strengthen the preventive, curative and rehabilitative services for burn victims.

Practical Hand Book on Burns Management, NPPMRBI, MOHFW,GOI","Symptoms of burn depend on the depth of the burn. Burns can be divided into three types.
First degree or superficial burns involves the upper skin layer. They produce redness (erythema) and pain (tenderness). Blisters are absent. They are typically caused by exposure of the unprotected skin to solar radiation (sun burn) or to brief contact with hot substances, liquids or flash flames (scalds). First-degree burns heal within a week with no permanent changes in skin colour, texture, or thickness.
Second degree or partial thickness burns affect deeper skin layers. Symptoms are more severe and usually include blisters.

Superficial second-degree burns take less than three weeks to heal.
Deep second-degree burns take more than three weeks to close and are likely to form hypertrophic scars.

Third degree or full thickness burns involve all skin layers. Skin is white (appears cooked), and there may be no pain in the initial stages. Due to extensive destruction of the skin layers third-degree burn wounds cannot regenerate themselves without grafting.
Signs of inhalational burns-

History of burns in closed space
Deep burns to face, neck, or trunk
Singed nasal hair
Carbonaceous sputum ,carbon particles in oropharynx
Change in voice with hoarseness or harsh cough","Common causes of burns may be classified as thermal or inhalational.
Heat burns occur by:

Hot liquids (scalds) - Scalds are commonly caused by hot liquids (water, oil), steam from boiling water or heated food. Young children are mostly affected by scalds.
Hot solids (Contact burns): Solid objects that are hot can cause contact burns, especially in children. Sources of burns from solid objects include ashes and coal, hot pressing irons, soldering equipment, cooking utensils (frying pans and pots), oven containers, light bulbs, and exhaust pipes.
Flames: Burns can be due to leaking gas pipe or cylinder, accidents from kerosene pressure stove, lighting of crackers during “Diwali”, catching of fires in tents as pandal fires.
Chemical burns-These are accidental burns in homes (such as from toilet cleaning agents), or as acid violence attacks (throwing of acid over somebody for seeking revenge and attempts to resolve disputes of love, land or business) and work place accidents.
Electrical burns- Electrical burns are due to exposed “live” wires or short circuits. High tension wires close to homes, play areas and roads can lead to electrical burns.

Inhalational burns:

Inhalational burns are the result of breathing in superheated gases, steam, hot liquids or noxious products of incomplete combustion.
They cause thermal injury to the upper airway, irritation or chemical injury to the airways from soot, asphyxiation, and toxicity from carbon monoxide (CO) and other gases such as cyanide and accompany a skin burn in approximately 20% to 35% of cases. 
Inhalational burns are the most common cause of death among people suffering fire-related burn.

Risk factors:
Burns are more common in rural areas and urban poor of low income countries; some of the factors that are of prime concern include:

use of cooking pots on ground level (floor cooking): toddlers and young children are at increased risk of scald burns as they can easily knock over the pots on the ground level;
use of open wood fires;
wearing of loose fitting cotton clothing (loose chunnis and pallus) can catch fire while cooking on an open fire (a risk factor for women in Asia); or due to faulty habits like use of clothing to hold cooking pot.

Other risk factors are:

Exposure to fire during occupation;
poverty, overcrowding(single room houses with kitchen adjacent to bed/play area for children)
young girls performing household work as cooking and care of small children;
smoking and alcohol abuse;
inadequate safety measures for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity;
underlying medical conditions such as epilepsy, physical and cognitive disabilities.

Burns can occur in home and workplace. Children and women are usually burned in homes in their kitchens from hot liquids, flames, or from cook stove explosions. Men are mostly burned in the workplace due to fire, scalds, chemical and electrical burns.","A detailed history and physical examination are the initial steps in diagnosis.
a. History regarding cause of burns and age should be inquired as it helps in diagnosing extent and depth of burns, such as: 

Flame burns are usually full thickness burns, scald burns from hot water spilling may be superficial burns while scalds from ghee, oil are likely to be deep. Chemical and electrical burns are deep.
Age of patients-At extremes of age (infants and older patents) burns are deep because of thinness of skin.

b. Examination: The severity of the burn is determined by burned surface area, depth of burn and other considerations. Morbidity and mortality rises with increasing burned surface area. It also rises with increasing age so that even small burns may be fatal in elderly people.
Whole body surface area is taken as 100%. Proportion of surface burn is represented as percentage(%). There are many ways to estimate the body surface area burned.

The “Rule of 9’s” is commonly used to estimate the total body surface area (TBSA) burned in adults. In this, body is divided into 11 equal parts making this 99% and 1% is given to perineum. Therefore 9% each for the head and each upper limb; 18% each for each lower limb, front of trunk and back of trunk*.
In newborns and children (younger than 10 years), because of the larger size of head and small body surface area of limbs, the Rule of Nine is not applicable. Lund and Browder chart can be used for the calculation of total body surface area of burns in children*.
The “Rule of Palm” is one closed hand of an individual is equal to his 1% body surface area. (A hand consists of all the fingers and thumb brought together in extended position with palm).

Initially most of the burn patients are well oriented and may look like as if suffering from a simple injury but any burn above 5% should be taken seriously.
Burns can be classified as minor, moderate and critical burns according to severity:
Minor burns-

Burns less than 15% in adults and 10% in children (excluding chemical, electrical burns and burns of face, hands and perineum).
These burns can be treated on out-patient basis.

Moderate burns-

Burns between 15-25% in adults and 10-15% in children.
May require hospitalization.

Critical burns-

Burns above 25% in adults, 15% in children and 5% in newborn and infants.
Electrical burns
Chemical burns
Respiratory burns
Burns associated with other injuries

Orthopaedic injury
Chest injury
Abdominal injury
Head injury","A burn accident can happen at any place and at any time where medical personnel are usually not around. The first aid has to be provided by the bystanders, who become the “first responders”. Extent of damage can be minimized by providing quick and proper on the site management.
On site management (first aid: Cool, Cover, Call):The basic principles of first aid remain the same for all categories of burns with some specific management for particular category. Rescuer should take care of his/ her own safety before helping burn victim.
Thermal burns-

The victim should be removed from the burning premises.
The victim should be asked to lie down on the floor with burning side upper most (stop drop and roll)(tough rolling is not advised by some experts as this practice can transfer the fire to previously undamaged areas and can also cause other injuries) . Lying flat prevents the flames from involving the face, head and scalp hairs and also prevents the fire from going around the body (as flames go upwards).
Prevent the victim from running as it only fans the flames.
If the victim is unable to walk or unconscious, drag him from burning site.
If there is lot of smoke along with fire, the rescuer should stay low/ crawl on the floor to minimize the inhalation of the toxic fumes (as the smoke, gases and hot air tend to rise). Breathing should be done through the wet handkerchief to filter out the fumes, carbon and other toxic particles.
Pour water in copious amounts over the victim to extinguish the flames and to reduce the temperature of the burn.
In the absence of water any other non-inflammable clear liquid such as milk, canned drink can be used. Or
The victim should be put on the ground with the burning side uppermost and then wrapped in a heavy cotton cloth (blanket/rug/dari/coat or any other heavy fabric).Once the fire extinguishes, the blanket should be immediately removed as it can retain the heat. (Nylon or other inflammable material should not be used for this purpose). 
Fire extinguishers can be used for putting out the fire.
Don’t throw/apply mud/sand over the victim’s body to put out the fire.
Allthe burnt clothes (including belts, socks and shoes) and the ornaments (necklace, wrist watch, bangles, bracelets, nose-rings, ear-rings, rings around the fingers and toes, anklets) should also be removed.
Do not apply any ointments, creams, lotions, powders,grease, ghee, gentian violet,calamine lotion, toothpastes, butter, colouring and other sticky agents, over the burn wound.
To avoid contamination, the burnt parts should be wrapped in a clean, dry sheet/cloth. Upper and lower limb injuries could be wrapped in pillow cover/plastic bags. Wrapping of wounds also reduces pain due to the air currents and provides protection during transport.
If burn injuries occur in closed chamber, patients may develop carbon monoxide poisoning. In such cases cleaning of the throat and putting oxygen mask during transportation is required.
Look for associated injuries (fractures or spinal injuries) and take care accordingly.
Don’t give anything to eat and drink as this may result in vomiting.
Formal oral analgesics are usually not given in the first aid. Reassurance and consolation to the victim and the family are important components of early care.
Co-morbid conditions/other pre-existing conditions (such as pregnant women, alcoholism, and drug addictions) should be inquired.
Seek immediate medical help. First 6 hours following injury are critical; transport the patient with severe burns to a hospital as soon as possible.

Chemical burns: 

In chemical burns, remove or dilute the chemical agent by irrigating with large volumes of water.
S.A.F.E. approach is recommended. S – Shout for help, A – Assess the scene quickly, F – Free from danger of violence, E – Evaluate the casualty.
The victims should be rushed to the nearest medical care units at the earliest.

Electrical burns:

Switch off the power supply and victim should be removed with a non-conducting material like a dry wooden stick/pole/wooden chair.
No such maneuver should be attempted while a person is connected to a high voltage source, as the current is likely to “arc” to the rescuer as he approaches.
Look for airway, breathing and circulation. If there is no response or respiration, the victim most likely has suffered cardiac arrest and CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) should be started immediately at the site.
Look for associated injuries.
Call for help immediately.

Lightning injury:

The victims of lightning injuries are managed in the same way as those of electrical injuries. These patients can withstand apnoea (cessation of breathing) for very long periods of time. Sometimes prolonged resuscitation with cardiac massage and ventilation is required.

Management-
a. Initial management includes assessment and maintenance of following parameters with ABCDE approach:

Airway assessment and management in case of inhalational burns (burns in closed space, deep dermal burns to face, neck, or trunk, singed nasal hair ,carbon particles in oropharynx). 
Breathing: beware of inhalation and rapid airway compromise. 
Circulation: ensure fluid replacement by securing wide bore intravenous line through which Ringer lactate solution can be given rapidly. Oral fluids such as ORS (Oral rehydration solution) may be given after initial resuscitation.
Disability: evaluation for neurological deficit or any gross disability. Compartment syndrome occurs when excessive pressure builds up inside an enclosed space in the body. The legs, arms, and abdomen are mostly affected by compartment syndrome. Treatments for compartment syndrome focus on reducing the dangerous pressure in the body compartment. Dressings, casts, or splints that are constricting the affected body part must be removed.
Exposure: (Percentage area of burn), the whole of a patient should be examined (including the back) to get an accurate estimate of the burn area and to check for any concomitant injuries.

b. In all cases, tetanus prophylaxis should be administered.
c. Wound care:

Adherent necrotic (dead) tissue should be cleaned.
After debridement, the burn should be cleansed with either 0.25% (2.5 g/litre) chlorhexidine solution or 0.1% (1 g/litre) cetrimide solution, or with mild water based antiseptic. (Do not use alcohol-based solutions).
A thin layer of antibiotic cream (silver sulfadiazine) should be applied.
The burn area is dressed with petroleum gauze and dry gauze thick enough to prevent seepage to the outer layers.

d. Systemic antibiotics are given to treat and prevent wound infections.
e. Proper nutrition with adequate supply of energy and proteins should be given to patients.
f. Specialized care may be provided during healing process in the form of skin grafts or surgical release of contractures due to scars.
First aid:
Do's-

Stop the burning process by removing clothing, jewelry and irrigating the burns.
In electrical burns, put the main switch off as quickly as possible and use a wooden scale or rod wooden chair to push the victim away from electricity. (No such maneuver should be attempted while a person is connected to a high voltage source, as the current is likely to “arc” to the rescuer as he approaches)
Extinguish flames by pouring plain water; if water is not available by applying a blanket and removing the blanket as soon as the flames are put off.
In chemical burns, remove or dilute the chemical agent by irrigating with large volumes of water.
Use cool running water to reduce the temperature of the burn.
Wrap the patient in a clean cloth or sheet and transport to the nearest appropriate facility for medical care.
Take care of fractures and probable injuries during transportation.
Ensure A-Airway, B-Breathing &amp; C-Circulation before transportation to higher center.

Don'ts-

Do not start first aid before ensuring your own safety (switch off electrical current, wear gloves for chemicals etc.)
Do not apply ice because it may further damage the injured tissues.
Avoid prolonged cooling with water because it may cause hypothermia (low temperature).
Do not apply paste, oil, haldi (turmeric) or raw cotton to the burn or any other material.
Do not open blisters with needle or pin, until topical antimicrobials can be applied, such as by a health-care provider."
Blepharochalasis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/blepharochalasis,"Blepharochalasis is a rare disorder that typically affects upper lids. It is characterised by intermittent oedema of the lids, with frequent recurrence. It produces eyelid tissue relaxation and latter atrophy. It may be unilateral in some cases. In addition to recurrent attacks of oedema, it is associated with ‘cigarette-paper’ skin and subcutaneous telangiectasia.
The term blepharochalasis was coined by Fuchs in1896. The term blepharochalasis is frequently misused to indicate redundant skin of the ageing eyelid, a common condition more accurately termed as dermatochalasis.
The word blepharochalasis originates from the Greek word blepharon meaning eyelid and chalasis meaning relaxing.","Patient may present with symptoms like

Unilateral or bilateral transient painless swelling of the eyelids.
Unilateral or bilateral swelling of the conjunctiva.
Proptosis (bulging of the eyeball).
Prolapse of lacrimal gland.
Presence of pads of fat due to atrophy of the orbital septum and skin.
Deep superior sulcus due to fat atrophy.
Thin atrophic bronze coloured eyelid skin which resembles parchment (thin, flat and stiff) due to atrophy of fat.
Multiple fine telangiectatic vessels.
Blepharoptosis (drooping of eyelid) due to thinning and atrophy of aponeurosis of levator palpebrae superioris muscle.
Horizontal blepharophimosis and rounding of lateral canthus due to dehiscence of lateral canthal tendon.
Ectropion.
Pseudoepicanthal folds.

Eyelid changes are exacerbated by normal process of ageing.
Occasionally, attacks are aggravated by a triggering event such as fever, weeping, upper respiratory tract infection.","Blepharophimosis may be a form of chronic angioedema with localised vascular dilatation and extravasation of proteinaceous fluid. Orbital fat may have increased vascularity and dilated capillaries.
Triggers:
Multiple triggers may be the factors including

Immune reactions.
Environmental factors.

Pathogenesis 
Pathogenesis is uncertain, but this condition may be immunogenic in origin. There is abundance of IgA deposits around elastin fibers. Infrequently there may be familial occurrence (autosomal dominant inheritance).
Associations
Sometimes blepharochalasis is associated with systemic illnesses such as

Amyloidosis.
Dermatomyositis.
Leukaemia.
Laffer-Ascher syndrome showing oedema of lips and thyroid enlargement.
Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (triad of recurrent labial oedema, relapsing facial paralysis and fissured tongue) may present with eyelid oedema of unknown cause.

Rarely, blepharochalasis may be associated with agenesis of the kidney, vertebral abnormalities, and congenital heart defects.
Pathology
Pathology typically shows loss of elastic fibers, Lymphoedema, vasculitis and epithelial atrophy. Stretching of the aponeurotic fibers of levator palpebrae superioris muscle due to recurrent low grade inflammation produces aponeurotic ptosis (drooping) of the lids.","Diagnosis depends upon history of disease and clinical examination. There are no characteristic laboratory findings.
I. History:
Patient gives history of repeated episodes of painless swelling of one or both eyelids with subsequent thinning of skin, usually affecting people between the ages of 10-20 years. Oedema is initially seen frequently in upper lids. The frequency of attacks is variable. It may be associated with a preceding period of physical or emotional stress. Occasionally, there may be history of allergy.
II. Clinical features:
Patient shows clinical features such as lid or conjunctival oedema, proptosis, ptosis, telangiectasia of vessels, ectropion, entropion, skin parchment, or pseudoepicanthal folds. The skin hangs down over the upper eyelid.
The disease may be separated into
A. Early phase
It may be further divided as

Hypertrophic form.
Atrophic form.

B. Late phase.

Differential diagnosis

Angioedema: Usually older age of onset. Oedema is widespread and is not limited to the upper lid. There is an association with complement 1-esterase inhibitor deficiency and auto-antibodies.
Dermatochalasis: It is a common ageing process with redundant skin and fat prolapse.
Floppy eyelid syndrome: It is typically found in older, obese men. There is an association with papillary conjunctivitis.
Idiopathic lymphoedema: There is unremitting brawny oedema (swelling of subcutaneous tissue that cannot be indented easily), seen usually in older patients.
Tumour: It presents as progressively enlarging mass. Biopsy may be needed for the diagnosis.
Drug induced urticaria.","Nothing much can be done to ameliorate acute phase of blepharochalasis. Avoidance of triggering factors may diminish the frequency of attacks.
Medical therapy:
Supportive medical therapy may be provided in acute and active phase of the disease.
No pharmacologic agents have proven benefits in the treatment of blepharochalasis. The ability of antihistamines, sympathomimetics, steroids, mast cell stabilisers, and cold compresses to improve symptoms of acute attacks has not been determined.
Surgical therapy:
Surgical therapy may be required in quiescent and late stages of the disease.
Surgery is performed after at least six months of disease inactivity. This is performed to correct anatomical defects being produced due to repeated attacks of lid swelling.
Corrective procedures include

Repair of dehiscence of levator palpebrae superioris muscle.
Eyelid tightening.
Blepharoplasty.
Reattachment of canthal tendon.
Fat grafting for fat atrophy.
Reposition of the ectopic and prolapsed lacrimal gland by re-fixation to the orbital rim.


Prognosis
The initial onset is usually before the age of 20 years, with unilateral or bilateral swelling of the eyelids and conjunctiva which lasts for hours to several days.
Proptosis indicates orbital involvement. The frequency and severity of repeated episodes tend to lessen with increasing age.
However, unexpected episodes may occur after an extended period of inactivity."
Bad Breath (Halitosis),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/bad-breath-halitosis,"Bad breath or Halitosis (oral malodour) is an unpleasant odour of the mouth.It is a common complaint for both genders and for all age groups. Nearly more than 50% of the general population in developed countries have halitosis.
Bad breath affects a person's daily life, causes social and psychological discomfort for individuals and affect their relation with other people.
Mild transient bad breath which often arises after sleep is common and generally not regarded as halitosis. It is termed as “morning halitosis.”
Some people complain of halitosis yet there is no measurable halitosis, even with objective testing, this may be a symptom of delusion or mono symptomatic hypochondriasis (self oral malodour). It is known as HALITOPHOBIA or PSEUDOHALITOSIS.
Such people may wrongly perceive other’s actions as an indicator that their breath is offensive so they adopt a variety of behaviours to overcome their perceived problem like covering the mouth while talking, keeping a distance from other people, or avoiding social interactions. These patients may become fixated with teeth cleaning, tongue cleaning and frequently use mints, chewing gums, mouthwashes, and sprays to reduce their distress.",No Symptoms.,"Halitosis has numerous causes and origins.
Poor Oral hygiene:

Sometimes it may be a consequence of lifestyle. If you don't brush and floss daily, food particles accumulate in between your teeth and on tongue; bacteria grow on the food left in your mouth and leave foul-smelling waste products (volatile sulphur compounds) behind, which lead to bad breath.
Lack of regular tongue cleaning, may be a cause of bad breath despite proper brushing and flossing. 


Dietary Habits:

Intake of certain foods and drinks such as onion, garlic, spices etc. and certain habits such as smoking, using tobacco products, drinking alcohol cause halitosis.
Fasting or starvation can also cause bad breath.

SOURCES OF HALITOSIS:
Source of 90% cases of bad breath is oral cavity such as food impaction in between teeth, gum diseases, dry mouth or reduced flow of saliva. Dry mouth ordecreased flow of saliva reduces self-cleaning of the mouth and inadequate cleaning of the mouth causes halitosis.
Not maintaining hygiene of orthodontic fixed appliances, wearing dentures and not cleaning them regularly, throat infections, oral ulcers and oral carcinomas may cause bad breath.
Non-oral reasons such as sinus (upper respiratory tract infections), diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis), lung and kidney diseases (end stage renal failure), gastrointestinal disease such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), menstruation (menstrual breath) accounts for 9% of halitosis cases.
In 1% of patients, the source of halitosis is diets or drugs.","Diagnosis of bad breath or halitosis, and assessment of its severity is very important to find out if it is genuine halitosis or pseudo-halitosis or halitophobia.
COMMON DIAGNOSTIC METHODS:

Organoleptic measurement

Bleeding Gums,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/bleeding-gums,"Bleeding from gums may occur while brushing or sometimes it occurs on its own (spontaneously). If you often see a pink tinge in the sink after brushing teeth, you have bleeding gums. It may be a sign of inflammation of gums. Inflamed gums appear red and swollen while healthy gums are light pink in colour.
Most common cause of bleeding gums is accumulation of plaque on the teeth. If this plaque is not removed by regular brushing and flossing between teeth, it hardens up and turn into tartar or calculus which cannot be cleaned by regular brushing. Calculus can only be removed by professional dental cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist. If not cleaned, over the time, it will lead to inflamed gums and increased bleeding from gums which is the main sign ofgingivitis.
If ignored and not taken proper care of oral hygiene, it may advance to gingivitis which may progress to periodontitis (disease of gums and surrounding tissue and bone). Bleeding gums may also be a sign of a serious medical condition such as diabetes, HIV, immunosuppressive diseases, etc.",No Symptoms.,"There are many possible causes of bleeding from gums such as:

Brushing too hard (forcefully)
Using a hard toothbrush
Lack of cleaning between teeth (flossing) leading to food accumulation and plaque formation
Gingivitis
Periodontitis
Hormonal changes in during puberty and pregnancy

Other causes that can exacerbate gingival bleeding may include diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, use of blood thinners (e.g. aspirin) andanticoagulants such aswarfarinandheparin, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hormonal imbalances, blood cancers (leukaemia), iron overload
Some less common causes are:

Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)

Dengue fever","If your gums bleed regularly, go for a dental checkup to get examined for oral hygiene status. Examination by dentist should be done to rule out the issues such as malnutrition, puberty and pregnancy.
Additional diagnostic tests to certain possible diseases may also be required. This includes test for diabetes mellitus, X-rays for teeth and jaw bones, blood tests etc.","If you don’t brush and floss properly and regularly, then do so.
· Brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day.
· Use an extra-soft or soft-bristled toothbrush for brushing your teeth.
· Learn proper brushing technique and how to clean between your teeth from your dentist.
Plaque forms very quickly and if it is not removed, inflammation of the gums start within few days, but good oral hygiene practices can help to remove it. Plaque harden to form tartar or calculus, further promoting bacterial growth. If tartar is present, get it removed by the dentist. The earlier it is detected, sooner it can be managed.
Health conditions like diabetes are often associated with gum disease as well. Some medications such as antiseizure drugs or blood pressure drugs also affect your gums. The gums also are very sensitive to hormonal changes, that occur during puberty and pregnancy. It is important for pregnant women to see their dentist.
Besides being part of prevention, oral hygiene is also important in the treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis."
Bruxism (Teeth Grinding),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/bruxism-teeth-grinding,"Habitual grinding or clenching of teeth, either during sleep or as an unconscious habit during waking hours, is known as Bruxism and commonly called as “Teeth Grinding”.
Pavon described bruxism as one of the most common, complex and destructive dental functional disorder (parafunctional habit). Initially, it is difficult to identify mainly as the patients themselves are unaware of it. According to Nadler, bruxism affecta large percentage of the population, including all age groups. In some individuals it may be considered as an attempt to cope with stress and anxiety.
Bruxism, usually, does not have any harmful effects but when it occurs on regular basis, it causes tooth wear, occlusal trauma, temporomandibular joint problems, and hypertrophy of muscles. Correct diagnosis is necessary for its treatment.
PARAFUNCTIONAL HABITS:
Drum introduced the term “parafunction”. Parafunctional activities, also known as muscle hyperactivity, are non-functional, oro-mandibular or lingual activities such as bruxism, jaw clenching, tooth tapping, cheek biting, lip biting, and object biting.
These habits are different from functional activities that are controlled muscle activities such as chewing, speaking and swallowing.
DEFINITIONS:

American Academy of Orofacial Pain defined bruxism as “diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional activity including clenching, bracing, gnashing, and grinding of the teeth.”
American Sleep Disorders Association defined bruxism as “tooth grinding or clenching during sleep plus one of the following: Tooth wear, sounds or jaw muscle discomfort in the absence of medical disorder.”
Zarb and Carlsson defined bruxism as “nocturnal clenching and grinding of teeth.”
Clenching

Clenching of the teeth is defined as forceful closure of the opposing dentition in a static relationship of the mandible to the maxilla in either maximum intercuspation or an eccentric position.

Grinding

Grinding of the dentition is defined as forceful closure of the opposing dentition in a dynamic maxillomandibular relationship as the mandibular arch moves through various excursive positions.","Clinical Features:
Bruxism causes sustained muscle contraction for long periods, reduces blood flow within the muscle tissues, creating the symptoms of fatigue, pain, and spasms.
Patients having bruxism may present with grinding or grating noise. Glaros and Rao have reviewed the habit and divided its effects into 6 major categories.

Effects on dentition
Effects on periodontium
Effects on masticatory muscles
Effects on temporomandibular joint
Head pain
Psychologic and behavioural effects

Firmly established habits show:

Severe wearing or attrition of teeth-occlusal wear, wear in between teeth producing sensitivity.
Harm the gums resulting in loosening or drifting of teeth, causes gum recession with alveolar bone loss.
Continuous clenching and grinding causes muscle stress leading to temporomandibular joint problems.
Results in masseter muscle hypertrophy, may interfere with maintenance of the rest position, cause trismus (difficulty in opening mouth).
While it has been suggested that bruxism may give rise to facial pain and headache, these are very difficult manifestation to evaluate and correlate.","CAUSES:
The causes of Bruxismare not completely clear. There is no single factor that is responsible for bruxism. Multiple causative factors of bruxism are:

Morphological factors: dental occlusion and the anatomy of the jaws may be associated with bruxism.
Psychosocial factors: Stress, anxiety and certain personality characteristics.
Special neurotransmitters
Patho-physiological factors such as diseases, trauma, genetics, smoking, alcoholism, caffeine intake, illicit drugs and medication.
Sleep disorders (sleep apnoea and snoring).

According to Nadler and Meklas, causes of Bruxism are:

Local Factors: Mild occlusal disturbances, which produces mild discomfort to the patient. Unconscious attempts of an individual to establish a greater number of teeth in contact or to counteract a local irritating situation leads to bruxism.
Systemic Factors: Gastrointestinal disturbances, subclinical nutritional deficiencies, and allergy or endocrinal disturbances have all been reported as significant causative factors, but their role is difficult to assess. Bruxism, sometimes may also be hereditary.



Psychological Factors: It is believed to be the most common cause; but none of the studies published in the literature regarding the role of psychosocial factors in aetiology of bruxism is conclusive. It has been found to be associated with high levels of anxiety, stress, and emotional tension. In children, nervous tension manifests as and may be related to chronic biting or chewing of toys. Some studies suggest that sleep bruxism episodes are a part of sleep arousal response. Bruxing children are more anxious than non-bruxers. A multifactorial large scale population study about sleep bruxism revealed highly stressful life as a significant risk factor.



Occupational Factors: Bruxism, sometimes present itself as an occupational habit. Certain occupations requiring precise work such as that of watchmaker, athletes engaged in physical activities favour the development of bruxism. Voluntary bruxism is also recognized in people who are habitual of chewing gum, tobacco, or objects such as tooth or pencils.","DIAGNOSIS:
Bruxism is not a life-threatening disorder but it affects the quality of life by causing dental problems, such as tooth wear, tooth sensitivity, facial pain etc. Therefore, its early assessment is very essential. Methods to diagnose it are:

Questionnaires used for both clinical and research purposes
Clinical examination of oral cavity looking for tooth surface wear, tooth mobility, tooth sensitivity, gum recession, discomfort and pain in jaw.

Some of the methods of assessing bruxism are:

Masticatory muscle Electromyographic recording (EMG)
Polysomnographic (sleep laboratory) recordings for sleep bruxism generally include electroencephalogram, EMG, electrocardiogram and thermally sensitive resistor (monitoring air flow) signals along with simultaneous audio–video recordings.",No Management.
Cancer,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/cancer,"Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division that leads to abnormal tissue growth. Many a times, people often use the terms cancer and tumor synonymously. But all tumours are not cancerous.
There are two main types of tumors: malignant tumours and benign tumours.
Malignant tumours:These are the cancerous cells that can invade and destroy surrounding healthy tissue, including organs. The cancer can spread to distant parts of the body through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. Not all tumours are cancerous.
Benign tumours:These types of tumours do not grow uncontrollably or do not invade neighboring tissues. They do not spread throughout the body.
There are over 200 different known cancers that affect humans.Most of the cancers are named from where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy.","Symptoms of cancer, are usually caused by the effect of cancer on the part of body where it is growing. Although symptoms of cancer may appear in the form of general debility including weight loss or tiredness, yet it is generally advised that if anyone is experiencing unusual symptoms for more than a few weeks than he/she should seek medical attention.
Local symptoms: Local symptoms generally occur due to the mass of tumour or its ulceration. For example:
Esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow, Colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel, resulting in changes in bowel habits.
Systemic symptoms: General symptoms occur due to distant effects of the cancer that are not related to direct or metastatic spread. These may include:

Unintentional weight loss
Fever
Getting extremely tired easily (Fatigue)
Changes in the skin color/ appearance","Various causes of cancer are:

Genetic mutations
Harmful rays due to exposure to sun/ radiation
Diet and physical activity
Hereditary
Environmental factors
Idiopathic/unknown","Cancers can generally be recognized by appearance of signs and symptoms through screening.
Screening: Screening tests help in detecting cancer at an early stage (before the symptoms appear). When abnormal tissue or cancer is found early, it is easy to treat or cure. By the time symptoms appear, the cancer might have grown and spread. This can make the cancer harder to treat or cure. It is important to remember that when a doctor suggests any screening test, it does not always mean that there is a cancer. People with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests. These tests include Blood tests, X-rays, MRIs, Biopsy, Pap-smears, CT scans and Endoscopy and many more.","Remedial treatment:Remedial treatment refers to treatment which seeks to make the patient feel better and may or may not be combined with an attempt to attack the cancer. Treatmentincludes action to reduce the physical, emotional, spiritual, and psycho-social agony experienced by people with cancer.
Surgery: Surgery is the fundamental method of treatment of most isolated cancers and may play a role in remedial measure and prolongation of survival. Biopsy is normally required. It is typically an important part of establishing the definitive diagnosis and staging the tumour required. Localized cancer surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along with the lymph nodes in the region(in some cases).
Radiation: Radiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation in an attempt to either cure or ameliorate the symptoms of cancer. It is used in about half of the cases and can be eitherfrom internal sources in the form of brachytherapy or external therapy.
Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy in addition to surgery has proven to be useful in a number of different cancer types including: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, and some lung cancers.
Stem cell transplants for treating cancer: Sometimes very high doses of chemotherapy are used, often with radiation therapy, in order to destroy the cancer cells. This treatment also kills the stem cells in the bone marrow. Soon after treatment, stem cells are replanted to replace those that were destroyed. These stem cells are given into a vein, much like a blood transfusion. Over time they settle in the bone marrow and begin to grow and make healthy blood cells. This process is called engraftment."
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/musculo-skeletal-bone-joints-/carpal-tunnel-syndrome,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a relatively common condition that causes pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers. The sensations develop gradually and then worsens during the night. They tend to affect the thumb, index finger, middle finger and half of the ring finger. It is generally caused by pressure on the median nerve in wrist.","The three main symptoms are:

Tingling
Numbness
Pain

These symptoms are generally seen in the thumb, index finger, the middle finger and half of the ring finger.
Other symptoms include:

A burning, prickling sensation (paraesthesia) in the hands similar to pins and needles
Dry skin, swelling or changes in the skin colour of the hand
Weakness in the thumb when trying to bend it at right angle, away from the palm (abduction)
Weakness and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles in the thumb","The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are caused by compression or pressure of the median nerve at the wrist.
Risk factors:

Family history: If there is any history of CTS in the family, there is increased chances of CTS in the person
Certain health conditions, such as diabetes and an underactive thyroid gland
Pregnancy
Certain injuries to the wrist: CTS can sometimes occur following a hand injury.
Injuries such as sprains, fractures and crush injuries can cause swelling, placing pressure on the median nerve.","Physical tests: Flexing the wrist for a minute or holding it elevated above the head for a minute are other commonly performed simple tests for CTS, and should stimulate the same pain, numbness or tingling in hand if you have the condition.
Electromyography (EMG): It provides useful information about how muscles respond when a nerve is stimulated, indicating any nerve damage.","Wrist Splints:A wrist splint is generally worn at night to support the wrist and keep it in the same position. The splint prevents the wrist from bending, which can place pressure on the median nerve and aggravate symptoms.
Corticosteroids:Steroids as strong chemicals help in reduction of inflammation.
Surgery:Surgery for CTS is known as carpal tunnel decompression or carpal tunnel release surgery. It is generally performed if the condition is persistent for 6 months. During surgery the roof of the carpal tunnel, known as the carpal ligament, is cut to reduce pressure on median nerve in the wrist."
Chickenpox,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/chickenpox,"Chickenpox is a viral infection and is highly contagious. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Chickenpox primarily occurs in children under 10 years of age but can affect the adults as well. The disease can be severe in adults. It causes different of skin eruption described as ‘pleomorphic rash’, besides itching, tiredness and fever.","It includes:

Rashes first appearing on the body then spreading to face, arms and legs
Itching
Sudden fever which can be mild to moderate 
Back pain
Headache
Loss of appetite
Feeling of un-wellness (Malaise)","Chickenpoxspreads from infected person to non-infected person (contagious disease). The virus spreads through coughing or sneezing of infected person. It can also be spread by touching the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters.
It usually takes about 10-21 days after the contact with an infected person to show the symptoms. This is called incubation period.","Chickenpox can be diagnosed with classical symptoms. However, Microscopic examination of the skin lesion can be done for laboratory confirmation of the disease.","Calamine lotion is used in in relieving the itching during checkenpox. Fingernails should be trimmed short so as to prevent skin infections caused by scratching blisters.

Pain killers (Analgesics) like Paracetamol, and ibuprofen help in relieving the pain.
Antiviral drugs may be given only in complicated cases or as prescribed by doctor.
The patient is advised to consume a plenty of fluids."
Chikungunya Fever,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/musculo-skeletal-bone-joints-/chikungunya-fever,"Chikungunya fever is a debilitating, but non-fatal, viral illness. It is spread by the bite of infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Aedes mosquito breeds in clean water collections. The water containers, tanks, discarded material such as buckets, utensils, tyres, flower-pots etc. are the breeding sites for these mosquitoes. The peak biting times of the Aedes aegypti mosquito are early morning or late evening. Chikungunya fever is caused by a virus of genus alphavirus in the family of togaviridae. It is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g. joint swelling), laboratory testing and the possibility of exposure to infected mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment for Chikungunya fever. The treatment is mainly supportive to ease the symptoms.
National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme

Chikungunya Fever","It is generally characterized by abrupt onset of fever, chills which is accompanied by joint pain. Other symptoms include:

Muscle pain
Fatigue and Nausea
Headache
Rash
The joint pain is often very debilitating, but usually ends within a few days or weeks.","Chikungunya virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person infected with Chikungunya virus. The incubation period (time from infection to illness) can be 2-12 days, but is usually 3-7 days. “Silent” Chikungunya virus infections (infections without illness) do occur, though rarely.","The clinical appearance of both chikungunya and dengue are similar. Therefore laboratory confirmation is important especially in areas where dengue is present. Enzyme-Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) may confirm the presence of IgM and IgG anti-Chikungunya antibodies.
Various reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) methods are also available but are of variable sensitivity. RT–PCR products from clinical samples may also be used for genotyping of the virus, allowing comparisons with virus samples from various geographical sources.","There is no specific treatment for chikungunya. Only supportive treatment is given to ease the symptoms

Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help in relieving pain.
Antiviral drugs like acyclovir are also given (but given only in complicated cases as prescribed by doctor).
Fluid intake: Plenty of fluids intake helps in keeping hydrated.
Infected persons should be isolated from mosquitoes as much as possible in order to avoid transmission of infection to other people."
Cholera,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/intestines/cholera,"Cholera is an intestinal infection which is caused when a person consumes contaminated food or water. It is generally caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, from one day to five days. After contamination, bacteria produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients.
The cholera bacteria are generally seen in water or food sources, that have been contaminated byfaecesfrom a person infected with cholera. Cholera is usually seen in places with inadequate water treatment, poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene.
The cholera bacterium may also live in the environment in salty rivers and coastal waters.","Cholera infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe.

Infected persons with severe disease will have:

Profuse watery diarrhea
Vomiting
Leg cramps.

In people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. If not treated it can lead to death within hours.","Cholera is a diarrhealillness caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. This species is not common to humans, and its presence in the human digestive system is not part of the natural life cycle of the bacteria.
A person can get infected by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium. In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the faeces of an infected person that contaminates water and/or food. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another therefore, casual contact with an infected person is not a risk for becoming ill.","Laboratory tests include stool gram stain (gram negative rods) culture, dark field microscopy or stool PCR. One must begin treatment even before diagnostic work-up.
Stool sample or a rectal swab is taken and is then send to a laboratory for the cholera bacterium.
Cholera cots:These are cots with openings to allow fecal output into a bucket, are used to measure volumes of stool loss and fluid replacement needs.","Have plenty of fluids:
It is important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS)is used to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices.
Medications:
Antibiotics can shorten the course and diminish the severity of the illness, but they are not as important as receiving rehydration.
Eating:
WHO recommends a child with diarrhea should be fed continuously. Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. In contrast, children whose food are restricted, have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly."
Coronary Heart Disease,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/cardio-vascular/heart/coronary-heart-disease,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the thinning or blockage of the coronary arteries, usually caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis (sometimes called “hardening” or “clogging” of the arteries) is the buildup of cholesterol and fatty deposits (called plaques) on the inner walls of the arteries. These deposits can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle by clogging the artery. This result in reduced supply of blood to the heart, thus heart becomes starved of oxygen and the vital nutrients it requires to work properly. This can lead to chest pain called angina. If blood supply to a portion of the heart muscle is cut off entirely, or if the energy demands of the heart become much greater than its blood supply, a heart attack (injury to the heart muscle) may occur. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death for both men and women living in urban areas as compared to rural India.","The most common feature of CHD is chest pain (angina) and heart attack. Generally pain occurs when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The intensity of pain is varies from person to person.

It may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing the heart. There may be an uneasy feeling under breast bone (sternum), but also in neck, arms, stomach, or upper back.
The pain usually occurs with activity or in emotional state, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin.
Other symptoms include shortness of breath and fatigue with activity (exertion). Women, elderly people, and people with diabetes are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as:
Fatigue
Shortness of breath
General weakness","Risk factors associated with the conditions are:

Obesity
Smoking
Stress
Hypertension
Sedentary lifestyle
Diabetes
Having a family history of CHD – the risk is increased
High cholesterol levels in the blood","Tests may include:

Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A stress test :
 Exercise stress test
 Echocardiogram stress test
 Nuclear stress test

Coronary CT angiogram
Coronary angiography - an invasive test that evaluates the heart arteries under x-ray

Cough,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/respiratory-tract/cough,"The cough is a sudden and often repetitively occurring reflex which helps to clear the large breathing passages from secretions, irritants, foreign particles and microbes. The cough reflex consists of three phases:

An inhalation
Aforced exhalation against a closed glottis
A violent release of air from the lungs following the opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound.

Cough can be either voluntary or involuntary. Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Coughing can be due to respiratory tract infection and can also be triggered by:

Choking
Smoking
Air pollution
Asthma
Gastro esophageal reflux disease(GERD)
Post-nasal drip
Chronic bronchitis
lung tumors
Heart failure and medications such as ACE inhibitors.

Types:

Acute cough: It begins suddenly and can be caused due to sinus, flu or sinus infection.
Sub acute cough: It lasts for 3-8 weeks
Chronic Cough: It lasts longer than 8 weeks.",No Symptoms.,"Acute cough: It is caused due to respiratory tract infection caused by a virus.

Post natal drip (mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose, caused by a condition such as rhinitis).
Respiratory tract infections like bronchitis or whooping cough.","If the cough persists for more than one week. It is advised to visit doctor.
Diagnostic tests An examination of the mucus from nose or throat. This test can show whether it is bacterial infection.
A chest x ray: A chest x ray takes a picture of the heart and lungs. This test can help diagnose conditions such as pneumonia and lung cancer.
Lung function tests:These tests measure how much air one breathes in and out, how fast one can breathe air out. Lung function tests can help diagnose asthma and other conditions.","Cough can generally be treated by treating the symptoms associated with it.
Decongestants: Decongestants relieve nasal congestion by shrinking swollen nasal tissue and reducing mucus production.
Cough suppressants and expectorants: Cough suppressant such as dextromethorphan, found in Delsym, DexAlone. In case of home remedy lemon and honey is very effective for acute cough."
Childhood Exotropia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/childhood-exotropia,"Childhood exotropia (outward deviation) is a horizontal exodeviation characterised by visual axis forming a divergent angle. It usually begins as exophoria. Exophoria is a condition in which eyes are straight without deviation when both eyes are open. However, eye under cover deviates on cover-uncover test or alternate cover test. It may progress to exotropia which may be latent (exophoria) or manifest (Exotropia). Fluctuation between phoria and tropia is common in exotropia.
Classification of childhood exotropia:
It is broadly classified as:

Intermittent exotropia

Constant exotropia:
Constant exotropia may be of following types:-

Congenital exotropia
Decompensated intermittent exotropia
Sensory deprivation exotropia
Consecutive exotropia

According to distance-near relationships, exodeviations may be further subdivided as (Duane classification):-
Convergence insufficiency exotropia: Due to convergence insufficiency, exotropia is worse for near vision.
Divergence excess: Due to divergence excess, exotropia is worse for distance vision.
Basic exotropia: Exotropia is equal for both near and distance vision.
Intermittent exotropia:
Intermittent exotropia frequently begins around the age of two years. A child with intermittent exotropia does not develop diplopia (double vision) due to bitemporal suppression, unlike acquired manifest exotropia in adults. With progressive suppression, constant exotropia may develop. Development of amblyopia (functional suppression of retina) is very rare. Manifest exotropia may be precipitated by factors such as fatigue, light glare, ill-health or visual distraction.
Congenital exotropia:
Congenital exotropia is rare and present at birth and may be associated with neurological abnormalities like cerebral palsy, midline defects or craniofacial syndromes. Infantile exotropia manifests during the first year of life.
Decompensated intermittent exotropia:
Manifest intermittent exotropia may increase with time and become constant exotropia.
Sensory deprivation exotropia:
Sensory deprivation exotropia is due to disruption of binocular reflexes by acquired conditions like opaque media due to a disease or cataract. It begins in children over five years of age or in adults.
Consecutive exotropia:
Consecutive exotropia may develop following surgical overcorrection of esotropia (inward deviation of eyes), especially in an eye which is amblyopic. Occasionally, a deeply amblyopic convergent eye may become divergent (acquire resting position of eye).
Secondary exotropia results from a primary sensory deficit (sensory deprivation exotropia) or occurs as a result of treatment for esotropia (consecutive exotropia).","Patient with Childhood exotropia may present with:-
- Patient may experience eyestrain following prolonged near work.
- Running together of words or missing of the word being read, due to divergence of eyes.
- Some patients may be aware of divergence and are able to control it voluntarily.
- Voluntary control of exodeviation may lead to accommodative convergence which makes letter appear small in size.
- Some patients have panoramic view i.e. increase in temporal visual field.
-   A child may close one eye (eye which diverges) in bright light.","Heredity appears to have role in exodeviation.
The cause of exodeviation is thought to be multi-factorial. However, successive generations in a family tend to have exotropia earlier and of greater severity.","For diagnosis of childhood exotropia:-
A complete eye examination is conducted including record of ocular motility.
Ocular deviation for gaze at near (33 centimeters), distance (6 meters) and far distance (beyond 6 meters) is recorded.
Assessment of the control of deviation is noted which helps in monitoring progression of intermittent exotropia. This deviation may be noted by the parents or is detected on eye examination.
The degree of deviation may be different in primary (straight gaze) and lateral (side) gaze positions. This is important to record from surgical point of view, to avoid post operative diplopia in lateral gaze.
Intermittent exotropia:
Patients with intermittent exotropia rarely have any complaints due to well developed suppression mechanism. Patient may have symptoms like eyestrain, headache, blurring of vision or difficulty in prolonged reading. However, these symptoms are quickly controlled by development of sensory adaptation. Not all intermittent exotropias are progressive. The deviation may remain stable for many years. The patient should be followed over time to know whether exotropia is stable or deteriorating.
Congenital Exotropia:
It is characterised by:
-Fairly large and constant angle of deviation.
-Since infant uses left eye in left gaze and right eye in right gaze (uncrossed homonymous fixation), development of amblyopia is uncommon. In some, if one eye is preferred for vision, then other eye may develop amblyopia.
-Infant has normal refraction.
- Adduction is not restricted.
-No lid involvement or pupillary abnormalities distinguishing it from oculomotor nerve palsy ( third cranial nerve).
Decompensated intermittent exotropia:
In some patients, exophoria progresses to intermittent exotropia that eventually may lead to constant exotropia. Deviations usually occur first for distance and later appear for near fixation. However, there are exceptions. The deviation remains constant or rarely may decrease.
Sensory deprivation exotropia:
An eye with poor vision (may be due to opaque media), or a blind eye drifts outwards into exodeviation. This usually occurs in children 2 to 4 years of age and in adults.
Consecutive exotropia:
Development of consecutive exotropia, after correction of esotropia, may take many years. Usual factors for surgical overcorrection of esotropia are excessive amount of surgery, amblyopia, high hypermetropia, and poor preoperative evaluation of patient.
Exotropia should be distinguished from conditions like oculomotor nerve palsy or pseudoexotropia. In pseudoexotropia, visual axis of both eyes is straight, but the eyes appear divergent.","Nonsurgical methods of correction are adopted in children having good control of deviation as well as in those where risks of overcorrection are undesirable.
- Correction of refractive errors: A trial of spectacle correction is given in all cases of refractive errors. Myopics, in particular, may control the deviation with glasses and may recover from intermittent exotropia.
- Prescription of overcorrecting concave (minus) glasses: Overcorrecting concave lenses stimulate accommodative convergence and may improve quality of fusion. It may decrease the exotropia.
- Part time occlusion: Part time occlusion of non deviating normal eye may treat suppression and amblyopia in deviating eye and thereby may correct exotropia and revert it to exophoria. Alternate occlusion of eyes may be done in cases showing equal preference. Part time occlusion has been found useful in very young children.
-  Use of prisms: Base-in prisms enforce bifoveal stimulation and help in relieving eyestrain. Prisms may be used to improve fusional control.
- Orthoptic treatment: Fusional convergence exercises may be employed in patients with symptoms of convergence insufficiency type of intermittent exotropia. Active anti-suppression and diplopia awareness techniques may be used in cases of suppression. Patient is encouraged to improve control on exotropia voluntarily.
- Botulinum toxin chemodenervation: It may be difficult to achieve long term alignment in cases of secondary exotropias. Botulinum toxin injection in extraocular muscles may be used in patients with constant exotropia who are at risk of postoperative diplopia and also who have undergone multiple operations. Preoperatively, if after botulinum injection, a patient develops intractable diplopia, then he may be advised against surgical correction.
In sensory deprivation exotropia, management involves elimination or reversal of treatable causes like removal of cataract. Prisms and botulinum toxin denervation do not play a significant role in the management.
Surgical management of exotropia:
Surgical management may be indicated in patients with:
- Poor control of intermittent exotropia: When manifest intermittent exotropia is present atleast half of the time during the day.
-Progressive deterioration of control of intermittent exotropia: Patients with increase in size of deviation, loss of control and a progressive inability to re-fuse images after manifest deviation may be considered for surgery.
- Severe eyestrain.
- Troublesome diplopia.
- Surgery may also be indicated to restore binocularity and also for cosmetic reasons. Surgical results are better for intermittent exotropia as compared to constant exotropia.
Surgical management options include lateral rectus muscle recession, lateral rectus muscle recession with ipsilateral medial rectus muscle resection and bilateral medial rectus muscle resection.
Surgery with preoperative conservative orthoptic or occlusion therapy gives the highest success rate.

Chalazion is a chronic inflammatory granuloma of the meibomian glands caused due to the obstruction of the gland orifices and thereby stagnation of the secretions.
Meibomian glands are the modified sebaceous glands present in the tarsal plates (thick fibrous tissue) of both upper and lower lids of each eye. There are about thirty to forty glands in the upper tarsal plate and about twenty to thirty in the lower tarsal plate. These glands secrete the outer lipid layer of the tear film covering the front surface of eyeball. The ducts of the glands are arranged vertically and open on the intermarginal strip (lying between posterior and anterior lid margin) behind the row of eyelashes. Similar modified sebaceous glands associated with eyelash follicles are known as glands of Zeis.
There may be acute infection of the secretions in Chalazion leading to small abscess formation known as Hordeolum internum. Similarly, glands of Zeis may develop acute infection and develop small abscess known as Hordeolum externum(stye).","Chalazion usually present as small, painless, firm roundish lesion over the tarsal plate area in the lid skin.
Chalazion may present as polypoid mass (pyogenic granuloma) by rupturing through the tarsal conjunctiva.
Marginal chalazion may present at the eyelid margin.
There may be a single or multiple chalazia (plural of chalazion).
A chalazion of the upper lid may press upon the cornea and may cause blurred vision due to induced astigmatism (a kind of refractive error).
An infected chalazion (Hordeolum internum) may cause painful inflamed swelling.
Chalazion may be recurrent. Meibomian gland carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma may present as ‘recurrent chalazion’ and therefore, requires further investigations.","Chalazion occurs due to blockage of the orifice of meibomian gland duct. Blockage of ducts may be potentiated due to certain associated conditions such as :-
Acne rosacea
Chronic blepharitis
Seborrhoeic dermatitis","A patient may have painless swelling present on the lids for days and weeks and may seek attention for cosmetic reason. There may be single or multiple swellings. Frequently, there is history of previous similar occurrences. A patient may present with diminution of vision especially with large centrally placed chalazion of upper lid pressing onto the cornea. It may lead to acquired with- the- rule astigmatism or acquired hypermetropia. 
It may present with painful inflamed swelling which may be infected. Severe infection may lead to preseptal cellulitis (swelling of the lids). Recurrent chalazion occurring at the same place may require further investigations to rule out any potential malignancy.
On examination, there is firm, nonerythematous, nonfluctuant and nontender swelling. Conjunctival surface under the lid may show dilated meibomian gland. A gentle compression of adjoining glands may produce inspissated toothpaste like material which is clear and oily otherwise. Conjunctiva adjacent to the dilated meibomian gland may be congested. Draining preauricular lymph nodes are not swollen unless there is secondary infection of the chalazion.
There may be features of associated conditions like acne rosacea, seborrhoea or chronic blepharitis. Rosacea shows characteristic features like facial erythema, spider naevus, telangiectasia or there may be associated rhinophyma. Seborrhoea is associated with excessive oily sebaceous secretion. There may be scales or ulcerative lesions on the lid margins in cases of chronic blepharitis.

Chalazion should be distinguished from conditions like:
- Squamous cell, basal cell and meibomian cell carcinoma
- Papilloma
- Capillary and cavernous haemangioma
- Molluscum contagiosum
Fine needle aspiration cytology in recurrent chalazia may help in ruling out any malignancy.
Infrared photographic imaging of the meibomian glands on everted eyelids may show dilated meibomian gland. Adjoining glands on imaging may show inspissated secretions.","Small, inconspicuous and nonsymptomatic chalazia may resolve on its own and may not require any treatment. Chalazion may be managed conservatively or by surgical means.

Conservative management:
1. Application of moist heat and lid massage may help in liquefaction of secretions, thereby facilitating drainage of sebaceous secretions.
2. Steroid injection into chalazion through transconjunctival route is a good alternative to surgery. It may be repeated in non responsive cases. A soluble aqueous preparation is preferred over crystalline suspension, to reduce side effects. Potential side effects are lid atrophy, hypopigmentation, visible depot of medicine if given subcutaneously.
3. Systemic antibiotics may be useful as prophylactic measure in patients with recurrent chalazia associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis, acne rosacea or chronic blepharitis.

Surgical management:
1. Incision and curettage is the procedure conducted under local anaesthesia to evacuate the contents of chalazion in most of the cases.
2. Biopsy may be performed on the remaining edge of gland after incision and curettage in cases of recurrent chalazion to rule out the possibility of sebaceous cell carcinoma."
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever-cchf,"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease caused by tick-borne virus (Nairovirus). It is a zoonotic (could be transmitted from animals to humans) vector-borne disease. CCHF causes severe illness in humans and has a case-fatality rate of up to 40%.
The disease was first described in the Crimea (former USSR) in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo and linkage of the both place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.
The disease is widespread in many countries in Africa, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia with sporadic outbreaks recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, and Turkey.
In India the first confirmed case of CCHF was reported during a nosocomial (Infections caught in hospitals) outbreak in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in January 2011.Subsquently outbreaks were reported from different districts of Gujarat every year. During 2012–2015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer). A CCHF case was also reported from Uttar Pradesh state. Pakistan reports 50-60 cases annually.
CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential (biological capacity of a pathogen to cause disease in a particular environment), its high case fatality ratio (10-40%), its potential for nosocomial (hospital acquired infection) outbreaks and the difficulties in its treatment and prevention.","Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).
There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).
Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena such as melaena (bleeding from the upper bowel, passed as altered blood in the faeces), haematuria (blood in the urine), epistaxis (nosebleeds) and bleeding from the gums.
There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness.
The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness.","CCHF is caused by virus belongs to family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus. Since it is enveloped virus, it can be readily inactivated. CCHF virus is stable for up to 10 days in blood kept at 400 C.
Vector (living organisms that can transmit infectious diseases between humans or from animals to humans) - The common vector of CCHF is the member of Hyalomma genus, the family Ixodidae. These are hard ticks and suck blood from animals and humans. Both male and female ticks can act as a vector for disease transmission.
CCHF virus may infect a wide range of wild animals and domestic ruminant animals such as hares, rats, camel, cattle, sheep and goats.
Environmental factors: Ecological changes, poverty, social instability, poor health services, and absence of standard infection control practices have contributed to increased transmission of the CCHF virus.
Mode of transmission-
Animal to human transmission-CCHF virus may be transmitted to human either by bite of hard tick or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.
Human to human transmission- Humans can become infected if blood, body fluids and wastes from patients with the disease comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, as occurs when medical care personnel sustain accidental needle stick injury. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.
Incubation periods-Incubation period depends on the mode of transmission of disease. It is usually one to three days when infected with tick bite with maximum nine days.
The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.
CCHF virus is highly infectious in the hospital settings. Nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections are common after exposure to blood and secretions of infected persons.","There are no rapid diagnostic tests.
Diagnosis of suspected CCHF is performed in specially-equipped, high bio-safety level laboratories.
IgG and IgM antibodies detection in serum by enzyme-linked immunoassay (the ""ELISA"" or ""EIA"" methods) from about day six of illness. IgM remains detectable for up to four months, and IgG levels decline but remain detectable for up to five years.
Virus detection in blood or tissue samples-Patients with fatal disease do not usually develop a measurable antibody response and in these individuals, as well as in patients in the first few days of illness, diagnosis is achieved by virus detection in blood or tissue samples. The virus may be isolated from blood or tissue specimens in the first five days of illness, and grown in cell culture. Viral antigens may sometimes be shown in tissue samples using immunofluorescence or EIA.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Real-Time PCR, a molecular method for detecting the viral genome, has been successfully applied in diagnosis.","CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a high mortality rate. Treatment for CCHF is primarily supportive.
General supportive therapy is the mainstay of patient management in CCHF. Intensive monitoring to guide volume and blood component replacement is required.
The antiviral drug has been used in treatment of established CCHF infection with apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective.
Appropriate treatment of secondary infections should be instituted."
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a term used to describe chronic lung diseases that cause limitations in lung airflow. The chronic airflow limitation characteristic of COPD is caused by a mixture of small airway disease (obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), the relative contributions of which vary from person to person.
COPD is preventable, but not curable. Treatment can slow the progress of the disease, but it worsens slowly over time. Because of this, it is most frequently diagnosed in people aged 40 years or older. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are terms that are no longer used and are now included within the COPD diagnosis. It is not a simple smoker's cough, but an under-diagnosed, life threatening lung disease.
At one time, COPD was more common in men, but because of increased tobacco use among women in high-income countries and the higher risk of exposure to indoor air pollution (such as biomass fuel used for cooking and heating) in low-income countries, the disease now affects men and women almost equally.
If urgent action is not taken to reduce underlying risk factors, especially tobacco use and air pollution, then total deaths from COPD are projected to increase in next twenty years. According to WHO, COPD will move from fifth leading cause of death in 2002, to fourth place in the rank projected to 2030 worldwide.","The most common symptoms of COPD are:

Breathlessness or a ""need for air""
Abnormal sputum (a mix of saliva and mucus in the airway),
Chronic cough,
Daily activities, such as walking up a short flight of stairs or carrying a suitcase, can become very difficult as the condition gradually worsens.

Systemic Features of COPD (extra-pulmonary effects) and co-morbidities:

Cachexia: loss of fat free mass
Skeletal muscle wasting
Osteoporosis
Depression
Anemia
Increased risk of cardiovascular disease
Lung cancer
Metabolic diseases and Diabetes mellitus

Stages of COPD- according tosymptoms:
Mild COPD- Symptoms of chronic cough and sputum production may be present, but not always. At this stage, the individual is usually unaware that his or her lung function is abnormal.
Moderate COPD-shortness of breath typically developing on exertion and cough and sputum may be present. This is the stage at which patients typically seek medical attention because of chronic respiratory symptoms or an exacerbation of their disease.
Severe COPD- greater shortness of breath, reduced exercise capacity, fatigue, and repeated exacerbations that almost always have an impact on patients’ quality of life.
Very Severe COPD–presence of chronic respiratory failure","Risk factors for COPD:
(I) Genes: COPD is a polygenic disease.The genetic risk factor that is best documented is a severe hereditary deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin.
(II)Environmental factors:
(a)Tobacco smoke: The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke (including second-hand or passive exposure). Cigarette smoking is most commonly encountered risk factor for COPD. Apart from cigarettes, people from India smoke tobacco using bidis, hookahs and chillums among several other forms of smoking. Bidis are more harmful than cigarettes (although they contain only one fourth the amount of nicotine, they produce four to five times more tar than cigarettes, making one bidi as harmful as one cigarette), hookahs are more harmful than bidis and the chillum is the most harmful of the lot. Smoking during pregnancy may also pose a risk for the foetus, by affecting lung growth and development of the foetus.
Passive exposure to cigarette smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke or ETS) may also contribute to respiratory symptoms and COPD.
(b) Indoor air pollution: Biomass (wood, animal dung, crop residues) and coal are used as the main source of energy for cooking, heating, and other household needs by some communities. In these communities, indoor air pollution is responsible for a greater fraction of COPD risk than smoking or outdoor air pollution. The other common indoor air pollutant is the burning of mosquito coils at homes to get rid of mosquitoes. Burning one mosquito coil in the night emits as much particulate matter pollution, as that is equivalent to around 100 cigarettes.
(c)Outdoor air pollution:Outdoor air pollution mainly from emission of pollutants from motor vehicles and industries is an important public health problem. High levels of urban air pollution are harmful to individuals with existing heart or lung disease.
(d) Occupationaldusts and chemicals(such as vapours, irritants, and fumes)
(e)Lung growth and Development-Any factor that affects lung growth during gestation and childhood has the potential for increasing an individual’s risk of developing COPD.
(f) Oxidative Stress(excess of oxidants and/or depletion of antioxidants are termed oxidative stress): An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants is considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD.
(g)Infections: Infections (viral and bacterial) may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. A history of severe childhood respiratory infection has been associated with reduced lung function and increased respiratory symptoms in adulthood. Tuberculosis is recognized as a risk factor for COPD.
(h)Socioeconomic Status: There is evidence that the risk of developing COPD is inversely related to socioeconomic status. It is not clear, however, whether this pattern reflects exposures to indoor and outdoor air pollutants, crowding, poor nutrition, or other factors that are related to low socioeconomic status.
(i)Nutrition:The role of nutrition as an independent risk factor for the development of COPD is unclear. Malnutrition and weight loss can reduce respiratory muscle strength and endurance, apparently by reducing both respiratory muscle mass and the strength of the remaining muscle fibers.
(j)Asthma: Asthma may be risk factor for the development of COPD, although the evidence is not conclusive.
The causes for COPD have opposite patterns according to the geographic areas. In high- and middle-income countries tobacco smoke is the biggest risk factor, meanwhile in low-income countries exposure to indoor air pollution, such as the use of biomass fuels for cooking and heating, is the main risk factor.","Diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who has symptoms of a chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnoea (difficult or labored breathing) and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease.
COPD is confirmed by a diagnostic test called ""spirometry"". It measures how much air a person can inhale and exhale, and how fast air can move into and out of the lungs. Because COPD develops slowly, it is frequently diagnosed in people aged 40 or older.
Where spirometry is unavailable, clinical symptoms and signs, such as abnormal shortness of breath and increased forced expiratory time, can be used to help with the diagnosis.
Chronic cough and sputum production often precede the development of airflow limitation by many years; although not all individuals with cough and sputum production go on to develop COPD.","An effective COPD management plan includes four components: (1) assess and monitor disease; (2) reduce risk factors; (3) manage stable COPD; (4) manage exacerbations.
Assess and monitor disease:
A clinical diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who has dyspnoea, chronic cough or sputum production, and /or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. The diagnosis should be confirmed by spirometry.
Reduce risk factors:
Tobacco smoke, occupational exposures, indoor and outdoor air pollution and irritants are various risk factors for COPD. Reductions of total personal exposure to these risk factors are important goals to prevent the onset and progression of COPD.
(a)Tobacco smoke-
Health care workers should encourage all patients who smoke to quit, even those patients who come to the health care provider for unrelated reasons and do not have symptoms of COPD. Counseling delivered by physicians and other health professionals significantly increases quit rates over self-initiated strategies. Pharmacotherapy is recommended in persons when counseling is not sufficient to help patients quit smoking.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has launchedNational Tobacco Control Programmewith the objective to bring about greater awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use. (www.nhp.gov.in/national-tobacco-control-programme)
With the involvement of mobile technologymCessation Programme- QUIT TOBACCO FOR LIFE“is initiated to reach out and support the tobacco users of all categories who want to quit tobacco use. (www.nhp.gov.in/quit-tobacco-programme)
(b)Occupational exposure -The main emphasis should be on primary prevention, which is best achieved by the elimination or reduction of exposures to various substances in the workplace. Secondary prevention, achieved through surveillance and early case detection, is also of great importance.
(c) Indoor and outdoor air pollution-Reduction of exposure to smoke from biomass fuel, particularly among women and children, is a crucial goal to reduce the prevalence of COPD worldwide. Public policy to reduce vehicle and industrial emissions to safe levels is an urgent priority to reduce the development of COPD.
Manage stable COPD:
The overall approach to managing stable COPD should be individualized to manage symptoms and thereby improvement in the quality of life. The approach consists of health education, medications, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, ventilatory support, surgical treatment.
(i)Health education- For patients with COPD, health education can play a role in improving skills, ability to cope with illness, and health status. It is effective in accomplishing certain goals, including smoking cessation. Education also improves patient response to exacerbations.
(ii)Pharmacologic treatment- Pharmacologic therapy is used to prevent and control symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, improve health status, and improve exercise tolerance.
a)Bronchodilators(medications that cause widening of airway) are given on an as-needed basis or on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms.
b)Glucocorticosteroids:The role of Glucocorticosteroids in the management of stable COPD is limited to specific indications.
c)Other pharmacological treatments-
Vaccines- Influenza vaccines containing killed or live, inactivated viruses are recommended to COPD cases. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for COPD patients 65 years and older.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy- It may be used in young patients with severe hereditary alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and established emphysema.
Antibiotics- antibiotics should be used for treating infectious exacerbations of COPD and other bacterial infections.
Mucolytic (mucokinetic, mucoregulator) agents-Although a few patients with viscous sputum may benefit from mucolytics, the overall benefits seem to be very small. Widespread use of these agents is not recommended. 
Antitussives-Cough, has a significant protective role, thus the regular use of antitussives is not recommended in stable COPD.
(iii)Non-pharmacologictreatment-
a) Rehabilitation- Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation programme includes exercise training, nutrition counseling, and education.

Exercise training- All patients with COPD benefit from exercise training programs, improving with respect to both exercise tolerance and symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue.
(b)Nutrition counseling- Nutritional state is an important determinant of symptoms, disability, and prognosis in COPD; both overweight and underweight can be a problem.

(iv) Oxygen Therapy-Oxygen therapy, one of the principal non pharmacologic treatments for patients with Severe COPD. It can be administered in three ways: long term continuous therapy, during exercise, and to relieve acute dyspnoea.
The long-term administration of oxygen (&gt; 15 h per day) to patients with chronic respiratory failure has been shown to increase survival.
(v)Ventilatory support- Noninvasive ventilation (using either negative or positive pressure devices) is now widely used to treat acute exacerbations of COPD.
(vi)Surgical treatment-

Bullectomy,
Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS),
Lung transplantation.

(vii) Manage exacerbations:
Exacerbations of respiratory symptoms requiring medical intervention are important clinical phases in COPD. The most common causes of an exacerbation are infection of the tracheobronchial tree and air pollution, but the cause of approximately one-third of severe exacerbations cannot be identified.
Inhaled bronchodilators (particularly inhaled B2-agonists or anticholinergics), theophylline, and systemic, preferably oral, glucocorticosteroids are effective for treatments for acute exacerbations of COPD.
Patients experiencing COPD exacerbations with clinical signs of airway infection (e.g., increased volume and change of color of sputum, or fever) may benefit from antibiotic treatment.
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in acute exacerbations improves blood gases and pH (a measure of acidity and alkalinity), reduces in-hospital mortality, decreases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and intubation, and decreases the length of hospital stay."
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19,"A cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019. On 7 January, Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as 2019-nCoV. Afterwards on 11February 2020, this virus is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease is named as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO).
To date, other six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. Out of these, four are globally circulated in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans. The other two viruses are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS Coronavirus) causing severe respiratory diseases. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, are zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals (civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively) to humans.
(SARS-CoV was first reported in 2002-2003 in Guangdong, China and MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012).
The precise zoonotic (animal) origin of the 2019‑nCoV is still uncertain. The virus has been identified in environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and some human cases have been epidemiologically linked to this market.
Epidemiological evidence shows that 2019‑nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another. In the previous outbreaks of other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS, human-to-human transmission occurred most commonly through droplets, personal contact, and contaminated objects. The modes of transmission of 2019‑nCoV are similar.
According to WHO, additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the geographic range of infection.
On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of WHO declared the 2019‑nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005).
COVID-19 outbreak was declared as pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. According to WHO it is a controllable pandemic and urged all countries to take a comprehensive approach considering their circumstances and with containment measures as the central pillar.

fever,
cough,
shortness of breath and
breathing difficulties.

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
Symptoms may appear2-14 days after exposureto the virus.
Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are high risk groups of developing serious illness.
People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately.","A novel coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that can cause mild illness in the form of common cold to severe respiratory diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, it means they can be transmitted between animals and people. Previous investigations showed that other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans.
The precise origin of the 2019‑nCoV is still uncertain. The virus has been identified in environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and some human cases have been epidemiologically linked to this market.
Mode of transmission:

The modes of transmission of 2019‑nCoV are likely to be similar.
The 2019-nCoV can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household, workplace, or health care centre.","Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19 diagnosis: tests for current infection (viral tests-molecular assays) and tests for past infection (antibody tests/serology tests).
Molecular assays:2019-nCoV can be diagnosed by molecular assays in samples from upper respiratory tract collected as nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and from lower respiratory tract by sputum (if possible for those patients with productive coughs) and or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with more severe respiratory diseases.
Molecular based tests consist of real time RT-PCR, TrueNAAT/CBNAAT. It only indicates the presence of viral material during infection and do not indicate if a person was infected and subsequently recovered.
Proper infection control measures should be maintainedwhen collecting specimens.
Serology tests: These are blood-based tests used to identify people who have been exposed to COVID-19 virus by looking at their immune response. These tests are used for surveillance purposes to know about the prevalence of a disease in a population by identifying individuals who have developed antibodies to the virus.
An antibody test may not be able to show a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks after infection to make antibodies.
National Institute of Virology, Pune, India is among the various laboratories have been identified internationally to provide reference testing support for 2019-nCoV.

Conjunctivochalasis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/conjunctivochalasis,"Conjunctivochalasis (CCh) is defined as the presence of redundant non-oedematous conjunctiva that may be asymptomatic, or it may be symptomatic due to unstable tear film or mechanical disruption of tear flow. Conjunctivochalasis is usually found in older people and is often overlooked, and is classified as a normal variant of eye due to ageing. However, it has been seen in patients as early as first decade of life with an increase in prevalence and severity with age. It is usually bilateral condition and consists of an elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva over the lower lid margin, most commonly in the infero-temporal region. However, in addition to temporal region, it may involve bulbar conjunctiva along nasal, central lid-margin or any combination of these areas. The presence of loose redundant tissue causes disruption of inferior tear meniscus. This conjunctival prolapse may impede tear outflow through the inferior punctum, resulting in epiphora (watering from eyes). It may also involve upper bulbar area with loose conjunctiva, but it is less common.
Descriptions of conjunctivochalasis were noted as early as 1908 by Elschnig. Braunschweig in 1921 and Wollenberg (1922) also described this condition. The term conjunctivochalasis was coined by W L Hughes in 1942. (Hughes WL. Conjunctivochalasis. Am J Ophthalmol 1942; 25: 48-51).They described more severe findings of CCh such as pain, subconjuntival haemorrhage and exposure keratopathy. Later works described mild/ moderate symptoms of CCh like dry eye and excessive lacrimation.
Other conditions causing tearing and ocular irritation must be ruled out as causative or contributory agents. Similar symptoms may be present in:

Isolated dry eye syndrome.
Dry eye syndrome with CCh.
Lid diseases e.g. blepharitis.
Allergic eye disease.
Autoimmune thyroid eye disease.
Contact lens wearers.","Conjunctivochalasis may be asymptomatic.
Symptoms are non-specific and the onset is insidious.
Ocular (eye) symptoms of conjunctivochalasis may be:

Irritation.
Foreign body sensation.
Discomfort.
Burning.

Symptoms of CCh tend to worsen with both down gaze and digital pressure.","No true aetiology is known for conjunctivochalasis. Senile changes involving the subcutaneous, elastic or supporting tissue in the conjunctiva was suggested as the cause. Eye rubbing, mechanical irritation or trauma to conjunctiva, and abnormal eyelid position were all implicated.
Francis et al. based on clinical and histopathological study suggested that the development of CCh is multi-factorial, which includes local trauma, ultra-violet radiation and delayed tear clearance as inciting factors (Francis IC, Chan DG, Kim P, et al. Case- controlled clinical and histopathological study of conjunctivochalasis. Br J Ophthalmol 2005; 89:302-305).
Watanabe et al. showed microscopic lymphangiectasia of the subconjunctiva without any inflammation. There was loss of typical fiber patterns with fragmented elastic fibers and sparse collagen fibers. They suggested that mechanical forces between the lower eyelid and conjunctiva gradually impaired lymphatic flow, resulting in lymphatic dilatation and clinical CCh (Watanabe A, Yokoi N, Kinoshita S, et al. Clinicopathologic study of conjunctivochalasis. Cornea 2004; 23:294-298).
Yokoi et al. by immunestaining, compared conjunctival samples of CCh patients with those of known normal and known inflammatory ocular surface disease and showed negligible role of inflammation in CCh (Yokoi N, Komuro A, Nishii M, et al. Clinical impact of conjunctivochalasis on the ocular surface. Cornea [Clinical Trial] 2005; 24(Suppl.8):S24-31).
More recent studies have suggested a mechanistic approach to the development of CCh. Mechanistic evidence suggests a shift in the normal balance of conjunctival matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are enzymes that modify or degrade extracellular matrix, possibly contributing to the pathogenesis of CCh. MMP-1 and MMP-3 enzymes have been noted to be over-expressed in conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts in tissue culture, while enzyme levels of TIMPs are unchanged (Li DQ, Meller D, Liu Y, Tseng SC. Over-expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 by cultured conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2000; 41: 404- 410). This interaction or change in balance of MMPs and their inhibitors, which normally participate in connective tissue degradation and remodelling, leads to clinically evident redundant conjunctiva observed in conjunctivochalasis.","CCh is one of the most common under diagnosed and misdiagnosed ocular surface disease. Non-specific symptoms along with intermittent findings of conjunctival oedema often lead to misdiagnosis. Due to fluctuation in findings of disease process, several clinical exams may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis of CCh is mainly clinical.
Slit lamp biomicroscopy (by an eye specialist) shows prolapsed or folds of conjunctiva in temporal, nasal or central part of lower lid-margin. Presence of redundant conjunctiva over lower lid margin suggests CCh. Prolapsed conjunctiva causes a disruption of tear movement and outflow through inferior lacrimal punctum resulting in epiphora.
Signs on slit lamp examination are:

Presence of redundant conjunctiva.
Altered tear meniscus.
Dryness of eyes on Schirmer test.
Reduced tear film break up time (BUT).
Fluorescein sodium/ rose bengal dye stain shows conjunctival staining in non-exposure zone.
Inferior punctum blockage in nasal CCh, resulting in epiphora, in spite of normal and patent lacrimal passage.
Anterior migration of muco-cutaneous junction caused by overspill of aqueous tears due to obliteration of tear meniscus.
Regional lid-margin inflammation, again due to overspill of aqueous tears.

Prior to correct diagnosis, patients with CCh are often diagnosed with more common ocular surface diseases, such as

Dry eye
Anterior blepharitis
Meibomian gland disease or
Allergic eye conditions.


Often CCh is not considered a significant clinical entity, or significance of the conjunctival finding is not recognised.

Many patients are first diagnosed when epiphora develops due to blocked puncta caused by redundant conjunctiva.

Grading systems:
Höh et al., looked at the number of lid-parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF) (Höh H, Schirra F, Kienecker C, et al. Lid-parallel conjunctival folds are a sure diagnostic sign of dry eye. Ophthalmologe 1995; 92: 802-808). They noted the number of LIPCOF had a high predictive value for diagnosis of keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
At present, the most widely used grading system was proposed by Meller and Tseng in 1998 who adapted the scale by Höh and associates, and included the extent of CCh, changes with down-gaze and digital pressure, and presence of punctal occlusion (Meller D, Tseng SCG. Conjunctivochalasis: literature review and possible pathophysiology. Surv Ophthalmol 1998; 43: 225-232).
Accordingly, the grades of severity of conjunctivochalasis, based on the number of folds and their relationship to the tear meniscus height are:

Grade 1: No persistent fold.
Grade 2: Single, small fold.
Grade 3: More than two folds and not higher than the tear meniscus.
Grade 4: Multiple folds and higher than the tear meniscus.

The newest grading system proposed by Zhang et al. in 2011 further modified Meller and Tseng’s approach by including three symptoms (epiphora, feeling of dryness, and foreign body sensation) and unstable tear film break-up time (BUT) (Zhang X, Li Q, Zou H, et al. Assessing the severity of conjunctivochalasis in a senile population: a community-based epidemiology study in Shanghai, china. BMC Pub Health 2011; 11:198). These modifications rule out asymptomatic, normal older people from the noted very high prevalence rates of CCh. The validity of this requires further studies.

Histopathology:
Most common histopathologic findings are elastosis or chronic non-granulomatous inflammation (Yanoff Myron, Sassani Joseph W. Ocular Pathology. Seventh Edition. Elsevier Saunders. 2015. P. 216.).
Microscopic lymphangiectasia is typically present.

Conjunctivochalasis should be differentiated from:

Dry eye syndrome: 

In dry eye, symptoms are worse in the evening, aggravates in up-gaze, Fluorescein sodium/ rose bengal dye stains inter-palpebral exposure zone, increased blinking and punctal occlusion improves it.
In conjunctivochalasis, symptoms are same throughout the day, aggravates in down-gaze, Fluorescein sodium/rose bengal dye stains non-exposure zone, increased blinking and punctal occlusion worsens it, unlike dry eye disease.

Sjögren syndrome.
Meibomian gland dysfunction.
Conjunctival infection.
Conjunctival inflammation.
Chemosis of conjunctiva.
Entropion.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Asymptomatic conjunctivochalasis requires no treatment.
Treat associated ocular diseases such as:

Dry eye
Anterior blepharitis
Meibomian gland disease or
Allergic eye conditions.

Therapeutic modalities for symptomatic patients:
Medical therapy:

Topical artificial tears lubrication: Topical artificial tears help in lubrication and may provide temporary relief.
Topical steroids: Similar to artificial tears, topical corticosteroids also provide some relief and may be used for mild presentations.
Antihistamines: Antihistamines are useful if there is a component of allergic conjunctivitis.


Surgical therapy:
Surgical therapy is indicated when conservative medical therapy fails and other associated ocular disease has been ruled out.
Surgical methods are directed against the redundant conjunctival folds.

Conjunctival excision: Conjunctival excision of the redundant tissue is the most commonly employed procedure for CCh. Conjunctival resection is customised according to degree of conjunctival laxity. Sutures or fibrin glue is utilised for apposition. Complete involvement of bulbar conjunctiva may require 360 degrees of resection.
Conjunctival fixation to sclera: Conjunctival fixation to sclera may be done after excision of redundant conjunctiva.
Amniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation has been described as a treatment with either suture fixation of the amniotic membrane or fixation through the use of fibrin glue. Since CCh is a condition of redundant conjunctiva, many feels that addition of tissue, such as amniotic membrane is not warranted.
Superficial thermocautery: Minimally invasive superficial thermocautery of the inferior conjunctiva, helps in CCh by improving conjunctival laxity. Cautery applied over redundant conjunctiva causes contraction of it to restore tear outflow.

Extensive conjunctival resections should be avoided in order to minimise complications, such as contraction of fornices, cicatricial entropion, and restriction of extra-ocular movement.
Prognosis:
Prognosis is generally good when the correct treatment is adopted according to the symptom complex in each individual patient."
Conjunctival Concretions,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/conjunctival-concretions,"Conjunctival concretions (Conjunctival lithiasis) are small vascular, granular, yellowish-white deposits being produced due to conjunctival degeneration and are found in the sub-epithelium of palpebral conjunctiva and fornix (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) in the elderly group or in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Deposits were found in patients as young as 20 years old, with the range of occurrence from 30-80 years old. Concretions appear as multiple tiny inclusion cysts containing yellowish-white deposits of inspissated mucous and degenerated epithelial debris including keratin. They are frequently discrete, but confluent concretions are not uncommon. In one study, no significant difference was found between the lacalisation on the upper and lower eyelids, right or left eye, and most of the concretions were superficial and hard, and mainly single. Associated dysfunction of meibomian glands was also noticed in some patients.
A recent article has emphasised how patients with conjunctival concretions are potentially affected with dry eye disease.
They are usually idiopathic, but they have also been associated with:

Chronic atopic keratoconjunctivitis.
Following post-trachomatous degeneration.
Sulphadiazine eye drop administration.

Degenerations of the conjunctiva are common conditions that, in most cases, have relatively little effect on ocular function and vision. These conditions increase in prevalence with increasing age as a result of past inflammation, of long-term toxic effects of environmental exposure causing deposition, or of ageing itself. Conjunctival degenerations may be associated with chronic irritation, dryness, or previous history of trauma.
Identification of corneal and conjunctival degenerations has improved with the use of confocal microscopy, immuno-histochemical staining, and genetic testing.","Concretions are almost always asymptomatic because they usually remain hidden into the palpebral conjunctiva, not noticed by patients, until they become large and protrude through the palpebral tissues.
Concretions may irritate eyes, but only if they erode the overlying conjunctival epithelium and come in contact with the cornea.
Protruding concretions may cause symptoms such as:

Foreign body sensation.
Lacrimation (watering).
Discomfort.
Irritation.
Redness.
Corneal abrasion (less common).","Concretions are formed due to the accumulation of epithelial cells and inspissated mucous in depressions called Henle glands.
The causes and risk factors for conjunctival concretions are variable but are associated most commonly with ageing and chronic inflammation of conjunctiva.
Causes and risk factors are:

Ageing process.
Chronic conjunctival inflammation (e.g. trachoma).
Tear film deficiency (present as decreased values of the Schirmer’s test and tear film break-up time).
Severe atopic keratoconjunctivitis.
Meibomian gland dysfunction (e. g. chronic meibomitis).
Re-crystallisation of certain eye drops (e.g. sulphadiazine).","Diagnosis of conjunctival concretions is often incidental. Patients are usually asymptomatic and conjunctival concretions are noted on ocular examination. Some patients with protruding concretions may complain of irritation and foreign body sensation in eye. Patients may or may not give history of chronic conjunctivitis.
Clinical examination:

Conjunctival concretions are small 1- 2 mm, yellow-white lesions typically present on palpebral conjunctiva and fornices (plural of fornix).
Concretions may be single, multiple, or confluent rarely.

Histology and Electron Microscopy:
The primary components of conjunctival concretions are degenerating epithelial cells and inspissated secretions from conjunctival glands. Following inflammation, the debris get trapped in sub-conjunctival depressions (Henle glands), and they often undergo calcification. The histology shows mucinous secretion from conjunctival glands. Occasionally, epithelial cysts are located on top of the concretions.
Conjunctival concretions are finely granular and membranous debris. These concretions were thought to be calcifications, thus the misnomer ‘conjunctival lithiasis’.
Staining properties:

Strong staining: In contrast to calcium staining, concretions stain strongly for phospholipid and elastin.
Weak staining: Concretions stain weakly for neutral polysaccharides and lipids.
No staining: Concretions stain negative for amyloid, collagen, glycogen, iron, muco-polysaccharides, calcium, RNA, and DNA.

Electron Microscopy:
Although conjunctival concretions may have substantial calcification, they are not typically calcareous hard and do not show crystalline pattern under electron microscope, therefore, the term lithiasis should not be applied.
Conjunctival concretions should be differentiated from:

Epidermal inclusion cysts.
Lymphoid follicles.","Management of conjunctival concretions:

Non-symptomatic conjunctival concretions: Since concretions are located in sub-epithelial space and are asymptomatic, management is usually unnecessary and is not required.
Symptomatic conjunctival concretions: If concretions erode through the epithelium and produce symptoms, they can often be removed with a small-gauge needle under topical surface anaesthesia at the slit lamp (bio-microscope), by an eye specialist."
Congenital anomalies (birth defects),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/congenital-anomalies-birth-defects,"Congenital anomalies (birth defects) can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (e.g. metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth or later in life. Congenital anomalies are also known as birth defects, congenital disorders or congenital malformations. Congenital anomalies are the major cause of new born deaths within four weeks of birth and can result in long-term disability with a significant impact on individuals, families, societies and health-care systems.
In nearly 50% of cases the exact cause of congenital anomaly could not be identified, although there are some known risk factors which can be linked with the causation of malformation. Congenital anomalies can be caused by single gene defects, chromosomal disorders, multifactorial inheritance, environmental teratogens (an agent, which can cause a birth defect) and micronutrient deficiencies.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, an estimated 270 000 deaths during the first 28 days of life were reported due to congenital anomalies globally.
According to March of Dimes (MOD) global report on birth defects 7.9 million births (6% of total births) occur annually worldwide with serious birth defects and 94% of these births occur in the middle and low income countries. According to joint WHO and MOD meeting report, birth defects account for 7% of all neonatal mortality and 3.3 million under five deaths. 
The prevalence of birth defects in India is 6-7% which translates to around 1.7 million birth defects annually. The common birth defects include congenital heart disease (8-10 per 1000 live births), congenital deafness (5.6-10 per 1000 live births), and neural tube defects (4-11.4 per 1000 live births) (March of Dimes report, 2006).
Some birth defects are clinically apparent at birth; others may only be diagnosed later in life. The structural defect such as spina bifida is obvious at birth whereas haemophilia a functional defect (a bleeding disorder) is not usually obvious until infancy or childhood.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has addressed the problem with the implementation of various national health programmes. In 2013, National Child Health Screening and Early Intervention Services covered 30 health conditions of the children aged 0-18 years through various approaches.
India Newborn Action Plan (INAP) formulated in September 2014, has integrated the approaches for the prevention and care of newborn with birth defects into primary health care, with an emphasis on maternal and child health. INAP is India’s committed response to the Global Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) by WHO with a vision to eliminate preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.",Some birth defects are clinically apparent at birth; others may only be diagnosed later in life. The structural defect such as spina bifida is obvious at birth whereas haemophilia a functional defect (a bleeding disorder) is not usually obvious until infancy or childhood.,"Approximately in 50 percent of birth defects a specific cause is not known. However, known causes can be divided broadly into two groups:

Preconception causes are genetic and partially genetic, originating mostly before conception. Birth defects are due to abnormalities of the genetic material--chromosomes and genes including chromosomal abnormalities, single gene defects and multifactorial disorders (which are caused by the interaction of genes and the environment).
Post-conception causes develop after conception, but before birth. Birth defect is caused by an intra-uterine environmental factor. This includes teratogens that interfere with normal growth and development of the embryo or foetus, mechanical forces that deform the foetus, and vascular accidents that disrupt the normal growth of organs.

Risk factors-
Socioeconomic and demographic factors:

Congenital anomalies are more frequently seen among low income families and countries.
About 94% of severe congenital anomalies occur in low- and middle-income countries due to poor access to sufficient and healthy food, increased exposure to various infections and alcohol (cause foetal alcohol syndrome) and insufficient health care delivery system.
Maternal age: advanced maternal age increases the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome.

Genetic factors:
Consanguinity (when parents are related by blood) increases the prevalence of rare genetic congenital anomalies; it nearly doubles the risk for anomalies in first-cousin unions. Consanguinity rates in India vary from 1% to 4% in the northern region to 20-30% in the southern region (especially uncle niece marriage). Consanguineous marriage in Indian Muslim communities is 20-30%. Some ethnic communities (e.g. Ashkenazi Jews or Finns) have a comparatively high prevalence of rare genetic mutations, leading to a higher risk of congenital anomalies.
Infections:                                                                                                                              Some Maternal infections during pregnancy can increase the risk of birth defects such as:

Rubella infection (German measles-a viral infection) to pregnant mother can result in to miscarriage, deafness, intellectual disability, heart defects and blindness in newborn.
Toxoplasmosis (disease caused by parasite found in soil) infection during pregnancy can cause birth defects such as hearing loss, vision problems and intellectual disability.
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs): such as syphilis, cytomegalovirus can cause serious birth defects.
Zika virus infection: during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects (microcephaly and other abnormalities).

Maternal nutritional status and medical conditions:

Iodine deficiency, folic acid deficiency, excessive Vitamin A intake may affect the normal development of an embryo or foetus, for example, folic acid insufficiency increases the risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect.
Obesity, diabetes mellitus and seizure disorders may increase the risk of certain birth defects.

Environmental factors:
Maternal exposure to certain medications, psychoactive drugs, tobacco, radiation and pesticides during pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital anomalies in foetus or neonate. Working or living near, or in, waste sites, smelters or mines may also be a risk factor.
Certain drugs when taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects; these drugs are called teratogenic drugs (Category ‘X’ drugs). Categories ‘X’ drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy. (Drugs are categorized into 5 categories according to the development of adverse effects on the foetus, category A, B, C, D and X.)
Foetal age at drug exposure determines the foetal damage as:

Before the 20th day after fertilization: there is all-or-nothing effect, either killing the embryo or not affecting it at all.
During organogenesis (between 20 and 56 days after fertilization):teratogenic effects may occur at this stage.
After organogenesis (in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters): teratogenic effects are unlikely, but drugs may alter growth and function of normally formed fetal organs and tissues.

Easy availability of drugs along with inadequate health services, intake of non-prescribed drugs and self-medication are some common problems.","For the detection of congenital anomalies screening can be done during preconception period, during pregnancy and after child birth.
Preconception screening: to identify those at risk of conceiving a child with a birth defect since inherited disorders tend to cluster within families.

Using family history to identify individuals at risk of having affected children.
Carrier screening for common recessive disorders (e.g. thalassaemia and sickle cell disorders).

Peri-conception screening: offering genetic counseling to women 35 years or older. Along with routine ultrasound other tests can be used for screening during the first trimester and the second trimester of pregnancy.
According to maternal characteristics/risk factors appropriate screening method can be used:
First trimester screening: is a combination of two tests performed between 11th and 13th weeks of pregnancy:

Nuchhal translucency test: with the help of ultrasound thickness of the area at the back of the neck (foetus) is measured. An increase in the thickness can be a sign of Down syndrome.
First trimester blood test: high levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) hormone and low levels of pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) are related with certain birth defects.

When during first trimester screening nuchhal translucency test and maternal blood tests are used together, they have a greater ability to determine the chances of foetus might have a birth defect, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) andtrisomy 18.
Second trimester screening: Second trimester screening tests are advised between 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy.

Triple screen test/ quad screening: The triple screen test is a maternal blood screening test that involvesthree specific substances: Alpha-fetoprotein test (AFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), and estriol estimation. When a test forthe hormone inhibin A is added, it's called a quad screening.
Anomaly Ultrasound: The ultrasound is used to know about different parameters of foetus and looks for any birth defects.

The integrated test (first trimester screening tests plus the quad screening in thesecond trimester) correctly finds Down syndrome in about most of the cases. If the results of first trimester screening tests are abnormal, genetic counseling is recommended. Additional testing such as amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, cell-free fetal DNA or other ultrasounds may be needed for accurate diagnosis.
Amniocentesis: during pregnancy foetus is surrounded by amniotic fluid that can be used to detect genetic disorders in the foetus. It is not routinely advised to all pregnant women and is recommended in pregnancies with high risk factors for the congenital disorders, such as (pregnancies at advanced age) for Down syndrome, muscular dystrophy, sickle cell anaemia, thalassemia and cystic fibrosis.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): in this test cells from the chorionic villi (tissues from placenta) are examined for chromosomal disorders such as Down syndromes. CVS isn't routinely offered to all pregnant women. It's only advised for further diagnosis when antenatal screening tests/ routine ultrasound show abnormality.
Cell-free fetal DNA- It is a noninvasive prenatal screening that uses cell-free DNA from the plasma of pregnant women as a screening method for fetal aneuploidy. It can be used in women 35 years or older, ultrasonographic findings indicative of an increased risk of aneuploidy, women with a history of trisomy-affected offspring, and women with positive first-trimester or second-trimester screening test results.
Cordocentesis: also called percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, a small sample of the foetal blood is withdrawn from the umbilical cord for detection of foetal abnormalities after 17 weeks of pregnancy. It is an invasive diagnostic test. This test detects chromosome abnormalitiesand certain blood disorders.
Genetic services: There are 77 genetic counseling centers, 78 laboratories, and 37 prenatal diagnostic centers in India as listed on the national website*.","Management includes:
Neonatal screening including physical examination of all neonates and screening for functional disorders such as congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria, sickle-cell disease and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency by trained primary health care providers can be performed. Neonates with birth defects may be further referred to appropriate level of medical/surgical facilities.
Effective life-saving medical treatment is available for several birth defects with functional disorders such as thalassaemia (inherited recessive blood disorders), sickle cell disorders and congenital hypothyroidism (reduced function of the thyroid).
Many structural congenital anomalies (about 50%) can be corrected with paediatric surgery in early life, such as simple congenital heart defects, cleft lip and palate, club foot, congenital cataracts, and gastrointestinal and urogenital abnormalities. Simple, cost-effective, and non-invasive treatment also exists for certain conditions such as clubfoot. 
Appropriate treatment is also needed for congenital disorders manifesting themselves after the neonatal period. This includes the early detection and treatment with rehabilitation services.
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India has made a provision for prevention, early diagnosis and management of birth defects under India Newborn Action Plan (INAP), 2014 along with basic mother and child care*."
Cervical cancer,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/reproductive-system/female-gynaecological-diseases-/cervical-cancer,"Cervical cancer
Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of body cells and can start almost anywhere in the human body. When cancer develops in the cervix of female it is termed as cervical cancer or cancer cervix. Cervix is the lower part of the uterus and connects the body of the uterus to the vagina (birth canal).The lower part of the cervix (ectocervix) lies within the vagina and the upper two thirds of the cervix (endocervix) lies above the vagina. Most cervical cancers originate in the area where the endocervix and ectocervix join.
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 530 000 new cases of cervical cancer globally (estimations for 2012), with approximately 270 000 deaths (representing 7.5% of all female cancer deaths). More than 85% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.
The highest estimated incidence rates for cervical cancer are in sub-Saharan Africa, Melanesia, Latin America and the Caribbean, south-central Asia and south-east Asia.
India has a population of 436.76 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Every year 122844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 67477 die from the disease (estimations for 2012). In India cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and also the second most common cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of age.
Nearly all cases of cervical cancer can be attributable to Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a group of viruses and one of the causative agents in the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and women with and without clinical lesions. HPV types (16 and 18) cause 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions worldwide.
Based on Indian studies about 82.7% of invasive cervical cancers showed the presence of HPVs 16 or 18 (Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literatures by ICO HPV Information Centre)*.
Other epidemiological risk factors for cervical cancer are early age at marriage, multiple sexual partners, multiple pregnancies, poor genital hygiene, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives, and lack of awareness.
India also has the highest (age standardized) incidence rate as 22 (per 100,000 women per year) of cervical cancer in South Asia (estimations for 2012), compared to 19.2 in Bangladesh, 13 in Sri Lanka, and 2.8 in Iran.
Cervical cancer can be prevented by vaccinating all young females against the HPVs and by screening and treating precancerous lesions in women. In addition if cervical cancer is detected early and treated in earlier stages it can be cured.","Women with early cervical cancers and pre-cancers usually have no symptom. Symptoms of cervical cancer appear only after the cancer has reached an advanced stage.
Symptoms may be:

irregular, intermenstrual (between periods) or abnormal vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse or bleeding after menopause;
bleeding after douching, or after a pelvic exam;
vaginal discomfort or odorous discharge from vagina, the discharge may contain some blood and may occur between periods or after menopause;
pain during sex;
back, leg or pelvic pain;
fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite;
a single swollen leg.

These signs and symptoms are not specific, may be present in other conditions also, but still it is advised to consult health care professional at earliest. More severe symptoms may develop at advanced stages of cervical cancer.","There are several risk factors which increase the chances of developing cervical cancer.
The most important risk factor for cervical cancer is infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV).

HPV is mainly transmitted through sexual contact and most people are infected with HPV shortly after the onset of sexual activity. Skin-to-skin genital contact can transmit the infection; penetrative sex is not required for transmission.
HPV infections usually clear up without any intervention within a few months after acquiring the infection, and about 90% clear within 2 years.
A small proportion of infections with certain types of HPV can persist and progress to cancer. The time period between the oncogenic (cancer causing) HPV infection and occurrence of the invasive cervical cancer is 15–20 years.

Risk factors that may lead HPV infection to persist and progress to cancer:

Early first sexual intercourse
Multiple sexual partners
High parity
Long-term use of hormonal contraceptives
Tobacco use
Immune suppression (for example, HIV-infected individuals are at higher risk of HPV infection and are infected by a broader range of HPV types)
Low socioeconomic status, poor hygiene and diet low in antioxidants
Co-infectionwith Chlamydia trachomatis and Herpes simplex virus type-2","Most of the cervical cancer and HPV infections in the early stages show no clinical signs and symptoms; precancerous lesions and early cancers can be detected by screening tests.
Screening for cervical cancer-There are 3 different types of screening tests:

Conventional (Pap) test and liquid-based cytology (LBC) - The Pap test is used to detect abnormal cells that may develop into cancer if left untreated. In a conventional Pap test, the specimen (or smear) is placed on a glass microscope slide and a fixative is added. In an automated liquid-based Pap cytology test, cervical cells collected with a brush or other instrument are placed in a vial of liquid preservative. One advantage of liquid-based testing is that the same cell sample can also be tested for the presence of high-risk types of HPV, a process known as “Pap and HPV co-testing.
Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) - Doctor may apply a dilute acetic acid solution (vinegar solution) to the cervix, which causes abnormal areas to turn white. Further a biopsy can be taken from abnormal area.
HPV testing for high-risk HPV type- HPV testing is used to look for the presence of high-risk HPV types in cervical cells.

Screening is recommended for every woman from aged 30 to 49 years at least once in a lifetime and ideally more frequently (WHO). Women living with HIV are advised to follow a different screening schedule.
Women who test negative with VIA or cytology, re-screening is advised at an interval of three to five years; whereas women who test negative with HPV testing, re-screening should be done after a minimum interval of five years.
If cancer is suspected in women during screening, they should be referred to a facility for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
Women who screen positive for cervical pre-cancer can be treated with Cryotherapy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and should receive post-treatment follow-up after 12 months.

Diagnostic tests for detection of cervical pre-cancer: some times, a diagnostic test is used for definitive diagnosis or confirmation of pre-cancer or cancer subsequent to positive screening results. Colposcopy, biopsy and endocervical curettage (ECC) are the commonly used diagnostic tests for cervical pre-cancer.

Colposcopy is the examination of the cervix, vagina and vulva with an instrument called colposcope. It is used in patients with positive screening results.
Biopsy is the removal of small sample of abnormal tissue for microscopic examination. Biopsies can be taken from areas of the cervix that are VIA-positive or from areas that appear suspicious for cancer.
Endocervical curettage (ECC) is a simple procedure in which some surface cells are gently scraped from the endocervical canal with a special thin instrument or spatula and examined under microscope. An endocervical cytobrush specimen may also be used for examination.

Cervical cancer stages-

Stage 0: The cancer is found only in the first layer of cells lining the cervix, not in the deeper tissues. The tumor is called carcinoma in situ and not considered to be an invasive cancer.
Stage I:The cancer has spread from the cervix lining into the deeper tissue but is still just found in the uterus. It has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.
Stage II:The cancer has spread beyond the cervix to nearby areas, such as the vagina or tissue near the cervix, but it is still inside the pelvic area. It has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.
Stage III:The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and vagina but not to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.
Stage IV: The disease has spread to nearby organs or other parts of the body.","If abnormal cells or lesions detected during screening tests, treatment is needed to excise them. It includes cryotherapy (destroying abnormal tissue on the cervix by freezing it) or Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) when the patient is not eligible for cryotherapy.
When cancer is diagnosed, the treatment frequently requires a multidisciplinary approach with the involvement of a gynecologic oncologist, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist. The treatment of cervical cancer varies with the stage of the disease.

For early invasive cancer, surgery is advised.
In more advanced cases, radiation combined with chemotherapy and in patients with disseminated disease, chemotherapy or radiation provides palliative management of symptoms.
Palliative care is given to help people with advanced disease to have dignity and peace during difficult and final phases of life."

Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever-cchf,"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease caused by tick-borne virus (Nairovirus). It is a zoonotic (could be transmitted from animals to humans) vector-borne disease. CCHF causes severe illness in humans and has a case-fatality rate of up to 40%.
The disease was first described in the Crimea (former USSR) in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo and linkage of the both place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.
The disease is widespread in many countries in Africa, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia with sporadic outbreaks recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, and Turkey.
In India the first confirmed case of CCHF was reported during a nosocomial (Infections caught in hospitals) outbreak in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in January 2011.Subsquently outbreaks were reported from different districts of Gujarat every year. During 2012–2015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer). A CCHF case was also reported from Uttar Pradesh state. Pakistan reports 50-60 cases annually.
CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential (biological capacity of a pathogen to cause disease in a particular environment), its high case fatality ratio (10-40%), its potential for nosocomial (hospital acquired infection) outbreaks and the difficulties in its treatment and prevention.","Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).
There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).
Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena such as melaena (bleeding from the upper bowel, passed as altered blood in the faeces), haematuria (blood in the urine), epistaxis (nosebleeds) and bleeding from the gums.
There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness.
The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness.","CCHF is caused by virus belongs to family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus. Since it is enveloped virus, it can be readily inactivated. CCHF virus is stable for up to 10 days in blood kept at 400 C.
Vector (living organisms that can transmit infectious diseases between humans or from animals to humans) - The common vector of CCHF is the member of Hyalomma genus, the family Ixodidae. These are hard ticks and suck blood from animals and humans. Both male and female ticks can act as a vector for disease transmission.
CCHF virus may infect a wide range of wild animals and domestic ruminant animals such as hares, rats, camel, cattle, sheep and goats.
Environmental factors: Ecological changes, poverty, social instability, poor health services, and absence of standard infection control practices have contributed to increased transmission of the CCHF virus.
Mode of transmission-
Animal to human transmission-CCHF virus may be transmitted to human either by bite of hard tick or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.
Human to human transmission- Humans can become infected if blood, body fluids and wastes from patients with the disease comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, as occurs when medical care personnel sustain accidental needle stick injury. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.
Incubation periods-Incubation period depends on the mode of transmission of disease. It is usually one to three days when infected with tick bite with maximum nine days.
The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.
CCHF virus is highly infectious in the hospital settings. Nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections are common after exposure to blood and secretions of infected persons.","There are no rapid diagnostic tests.
Diagnosis of suspected CCHF is performed in specially-equipped, high bio-safety level laboratories.
IgG and IgM antibodies detection in serum by enzyme-linked immunoassay (the ""ELISA"" or ""EIA"" methods) from about day six of illness. IgM remains detectable for up to four months, and IgG levels decline but remain detectable for up to five years.
Virus detection in blood or tissue samples-Patients with fatal disease do not usually develop a measurable antibody response and in these individuals, as well as in patients in the first few days of illness, diagnosis is achieved by virus detection in blood or tissue samples. The virus may be isolated from blood or tissue specimens in the first five days of illness, and grown in cell culture. Viral antigens may sometimes be shown in tissue samples using immunofluorescence or EIA.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Real-Time PCR, a molecular method for detecting the viral genome, has been successfully applied in diagnosis.","CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a high mortality rate. Treatment for CCHF is primarily supportive.
General supportive therapy is the mainstay of patient management in CCHF. Intensive monitoring to guide volume and blood component replacement is required.
The antiviral drug has been used in treatment of established CCHF infection with apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective.
Appropriate treatment of secondary infections should be instituted."
Chemical Injuries to the Eyes,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/chemical-injuries-to-the-eyes,"Chemical Injuries to the Eye constitutes an ophthalmic emergency, due to the potential for permanent visual impairment and threat to the structural integrity of the eye. Severe injury may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium.
Chemical injuries cause tissue destruction created from a wave of strongly dissociated ions flooding the eyelid and/or tear film and reservoir, penetrating the cornea and adjacent tissues, thereby reaching to the aqueous humour. Immediate shrinkage of the collagenous envelope of the eye results in a rapid rise in intraocular pressure, followed by a second rise which lasts longer and is produced by prostaglandin release. At any time, rise in pressure can occur due to clogging of the trabecular meshwork by necrotic debris, and from organisation of inflammatory components, followed by cicatricial closure of the chamber angle, especially inferiorly.
Inflammatory cells, most importantly, neutrophils, pour into the damaged tissue, releasing superoxide radicals and tissue degrading enzymes. There may be development of corneal ulcerations, perforations, and vascularisation.
Responsible chemicals producing injury are numerous and include cleaning agents, fertilisers, refrigerants, cement, preservatives and fireworks. Alkali injuries occur more frequently than acid injuries, due to alkalis being more commonly present in household and industrial products. Ocular burns caused by detergents and thermal agents are less common.
Fortunately, the majority of chemical injuries are classified as mild. Injured patients are usually young, male and exposure most commonly occurs in a variety of agricultural, industrial and domestic settings, or less commonly in association with a criminal assault. Unfortunately, there is a rise in number of patients presenting with chemical eye injuries resulting from assault.
The final visual prognosis is influenced by the nature of the chemical insult, the extent of ocular damage, and the timing and efficacy of treatment.
Regarding terminology, the literature is full with expressions like alkali ‘burns’, potentially confusing the alkali-injury terminology with a, usually non-existent, thermal, or even open flame component. When both chemical and thermal injuries occur simultaneously, the terms ‘alkali-thermal injury’ or ‘thermal-alkali injury’ might be used, with the most prominent injurious agent stated first. Acid injuries should be referred to in a similar way.","Most common immediate symptoms are:

Severe pain.
Red eyes.
Watering or epiphora.
Foreign body sensation.
Blurring of vision.
Reduced visual acuity.
Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light).
Blepharospasm (sustained involuntary closure of eyelids).","More than 25,000 chemical products with the potential to cause chemical eye injuries have been identified, many of which may be classified as acids or bases, oxidising or reducing agents, or corrosives. Acids and bases are the most frequently implicated chemical agents. The severity of the injury is related to the nature, concentration, quantity and pH of the chemical involved. It also depends upon the duration of contact and surface area of exposure. History of high-velocity (explosive) chemical injury should always raise suspicion of an associated intraocular foreign body.
Causative agents of chemical injury are:
Alkalis:
Most common causes of alkali injury to the eye are lye, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lime, wet/dry cement and ammonia. Most severe injuries are typically caused by ammonia and lye which are both capable of rapid penetration into the eye. The severity of the injury is dependent on the anion concentration, the dissociation of the alkali, and the quantity of fluid. A wave of hydroxyl ions rapidly advances through ocular tissues, causing massive cell death by saponification of cellular membranes and extensive hydrolysis of glycosa-aminoglycans and collagen within the corneal matrix. Damage caused by lime injuries is reduced by the precipitation of calcium soaps that hinders further penetration. Presence of magnesium hydroxide in fireworks results in a combined chemical and thermal injury.
The most important agents causing alkali injuries to the eye are:

Ammonia (NH3): Ammonia (NH3) is available as a fertiliser and refrigerant, and is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. Ammonium hydroxide ranks high in severity in causing injuries to eyes. It is commonly used as a household cleansing agent. Even 7% solution of ammonia is capable of causing major ocular damage, due to its high solubility and penetrability.
Lye: Lye, caustic soda or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), penetrates into the interior of the eye in 3-5 minutes. Solid sodium hydroxide, often used as a drain cleaner, can cause pressure to develop within the drainpipe, resulting in an explosion of lye into the face and eyes. Warmed lye is also commonly used to straighten curly hair. Caustic soda is also used in the manufacture of pulp, paper, textiles and soaps. Due to easy availability in home, it is a common chemical being used by paramours during attack. Lye injuries rank second in severity to those produced by ammonium hydroxide.
Potassium hydroxide (KOH): Potassium hydroxide (KOH) or caustic potash penetrates the eye slightly less rapidly than sodium hydroxide. Dissolution of potassium hydroxide in water is strongly exothermic (produces heat) and it is corrosive.
Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2): Magnesium hydroxide(Mg(OH)2) also penetrates the eye slightly less rapidly than sodium hydroxide. Magnesium hydroxide is found in sparklers and flares; the combination of thermal injury and chemical injury accounts for more severe injury than that being produced by either type alone.
Lime (Ca(OH)2): Lime, fresh lime or quicklime, calcium hydrate, plaster, cement , mortar and whitewash penetrates the eye less rapidly because it reacts with epithelial cell membranes, forming calcium soaps that precipitate and hinder further penetration. Lime, found in cement and plaster, is the most common cause of alkali injury. Retained particulate matter provides sump for on-going injury. Despite this, these injuries can be quite severe, with the corneal opacity visible before the opacity in case of ammonium or sodium hydroxide.
Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide: Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is a catalyst, and commonly used in various industries. It can cause both immediate and delayed corneal injury. There may be exacerbations and remissions of limbal and corneal disease lasting for more than twenty years.

Acids:
Weak acidic compounds precipitate proteins within the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, thus acting as a partial barrier to further penetration of the chemical. It leaves a greyish white epithelium, which often obscures all tissue underneath it. Stripping off this opacified epithelium often reveals a relatively clear underlying corneal stroma. As long as the corneal stem cells near the limbus are not damaged, epithelial recovery is likely, with little or no stromal cloudiness.
Hydrofluoric, sulphuric, sulphurous, chromic, and hydrochloric acids are the most common causes of acid burns. Strong acids ionise completely in an aqueous solution. The strength of an acid depends on its ability to dissociate and lose a proton. The primary mechanism of damage by acids is due to the action of dissociated proton. Hydrofluoric acid causes most severe acid injury due to its unique properties. Hydrofluoric acid has a unique dissolving action which allows it to quickly penetrate into deeper tissues. Moreover, hydrofluoric acid chelates all calcium and magnesium from cells, thereby halting cellular biochemical activity.
Although alkalis typically cause the most serious chemical injuries, the presence of an acid injury does not preclude an equally severe ocular injury. Very strong acids, however, overcome this precipitated obstacle and progress through tissue, much as alkalis. Indeed, there is no clinically significant difference in course of injury and prognosis between severe acid and alkali burns. The end result of a very severe acid injury is often indistinguishable from that of an alkali injury.
The most important agents causing acid injuries to the eye are:

Hydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride (HF): Hydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride (HF) is a weak inorganic acid but a strong solvent, widely used in industries. HF is used in polishing and etching of glass and silicone, in the pickling or chemical milling of metals, and in the refining of uranium, tantalum, and berrylium. In the semiconductor industry it is essential in the manufacture of silicon chips.

HF produces severe ocular injury because of its high degree of activity in dissolving cellular membranes. It chelates calcium/ magnesium ions and penetrates rapidly due to its low molecular weight. It is highly toxic so that as little as 7 ml of HF, or 2.5% burn of the body surface, is sufficient to cause death from uncontrolled hypocalcaemia.
It is found either in pure form or mixed with agents like nitric acid, ammonium difluoride, and acetic acid.

Sulphuric acid (H2SO4): Sulphuric acid is commonly used in batteries and also as industrial chemical. The most common cause of acid burns is sulphuric acid. Sulphuric acid produces injuries varying in degree from mild to very severe. Most of the injuries, especially the more severe ones, occur as a result of battery explosions. Hydrogen and oxygen are produced by electrolysis when sulphuric acid combines with water in the battery. This gaseous mixture explodes on contact with flame. Matches or cigarette lighters used as illumination sources or sparks produced by jumper cables are the most common modes of ignition. Injuries that result from battery explosions are usually combination of acid burn and contusion from particulate matter, but may also show laceration or intraocular foreign body penetration.

Injury with sulphuric acid may be compounded by thermal burns from heat generated by the reaction of acid with water on the corneal tear film. Dissolution of concentrated sulphuric acid in water results in release of heat, which causes tissues charring.

Sulphurous acid (H2SO3): Sulphur dioxide (SO2) forms H2SO3 when it combines with water in the eye. It may be present as sulphurous anhydride or sulphurous oxide; a fruit and vegetable preservative, bleach, and refrigerant. Sulphurous acid denatures protein and inactivate various enzymes. Sulphurous acid penetrates the tissue easily, because it is highly soluble in lipid and water.

At first, visual acuity is not severely affected after exposure to sulphurous acid, but it worsens greatly over hours to days as the ocular condition deteriorates.

Hydrochloric acid (HCl): Hydrochloric acid (present in gastric juices as well) is used in household cleaning and in production of plastics. Fumes of hydrogen chloride gas, act as irritant to the eye and produce profuse tearing which serves to limit ocular damage. At high concentrations and with prolonged exposure, liquid HCl produces severe ocular damage.
Nitric acid (HNO3): Injuries produced by nitric acid (HNO3) are similar to those produced by HCl, except that the opacity in epithelium produced by nitric acid is yellowish rather than white, as it is in other types of acid burns.
Chromic acid: Chromic acid is a strong agent derived from chromic oxide and chromium trioxide. Ocular injuries caused by chromic acid result from exposure to droplets of the acid in the chrome-plating industry. It produces chronic conjunctival inflammation and a brown discolouration of the epithelium, in the exposed interpalpebral fissure.
Acetic acid (CH3COOH): Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a relatively weak organic acid, and is also known as vinegar and glacial acetic acid. The various forms of acetic acid, especially vinegar, typically produce only minor ocular damage, unless exposure is prolonged. Exposure to a solution in strength more than10% produces severe injury due to corrosive action, unless the time of exposure is exceedingly short. ‘Essence of vinegar’ (80% acetic acid) and glacial acetic acid (90%) are the most concentrated forms of acetic acid, and most likely to produce severe ocular injury.

Other toxic chemicals: 
Other types of ocular chemical injuries are usually less severe than alkali and acid injuries.
Lacrimatory agents: Lacrimatory agents are aerosol dispersed chemicals which produce ocular irritation.
Common lacrimatory agents are:

Tear gas: Common agents used in tear gas are chloroacetophenone, chlorobenzylidene nalononitrile or dibenzoxazepine. Tear gas is used in riot control. Exposure to these chemicals causes ocular stinging, pain, excessive watering and inability to open eyes.
Chemical Mace (nonlethal spray containing purified tear gas and chemical solvent): Chemical Mace and similar compounds can cause minor to severe ocular injury, depending on a number of factors. The ocular injury associated with the original Chemical Mace is caused by the lacrimator chloroacetophenone.Degree of severity depends upon proximity of spray can to the eye, quantity of chemical entering the eye, duration of exposure, state of normal reflex mechanisms, and the mechanism of propelling the chemical.Extensive exposure leads to damage including loss of ocular surface epithelium, severe persistent stromal oedema, presumably secondary to endothelial damage, stromal clouding, and corneal neovascularisation.

Pepper spray (Oleoresin capsicum): Pepper spray (Oleoresin capsicum) is used for riot control or self defence. Exposure to these chemicals causes ocular stinging, pain, excessive watering and inability to open eyes.
Mustard gas (Dichlorodiethyl sulphide): Mustard gas (Dichlorodiethyl sulphide) is a poisonous agent used as a chemical warfare agent. It causes irritation of conjunctiva and sore sticky eyes on exposure or a chronic and delayed mustard gas keratitis manifesting as recurrent corneal erosions.

Chemicals and Festivals in India:
Holi: The colourful festival of Holi is celebrated in Phalgun month of Indian calendar, which falls in February end or month of March, every year. It is also known as festival of colours. Instead of using natural colours, people mix harmful chemicals in colours. Most of these chemical colours are oxidised metals or industrial dyes mixed with inferior quality oil e.g. engine oil. Many water colours have an alkaline base which is harmful.
Chemicals used to impart different colours may be:

Copper sulphate: It imparts green colour.
Chromium iodide: It imparts purple colour.
Aluminium bromide: It produces white to yellowish red shade to the colour.
Mercury sulphide: Mercury sulphide gives red colour.
Powdered glass: Powdered glass is used to produce shiny colour.

Diwali (Deepavali): Diwali is an important Indian festival celebrated by lighting lamps and bursting crackers. Diwali festival also marks end of Ashwin and beginning of Kartik month of Indian calendar and it falls in the month of October or November. The chemicals released by the firecrackers are harmful.
Chemical in firework includes:

Sulphur dioxide.
Cadmium.
Copper.
Lead.
Magnesium.
Nitrate.
Nitrite.

Magnesium hydroxide is found in sparklers and flares. The combination of thermal and chemical injury accounts for more severe injury.
Firecrackers release chemical pollutants such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

Pathophysiology:
Alkalis:
The severity of an ocular chemical injury is determined by the ability of the chemical to penetrate the eye. Alkalis, characteristically, penetrate the eye more rapidly than acids.
The hydroxyl anion (OH) saponifies plasma membranes, resulting in cell disruption and death, while the cation is responsible for the penetration by the alkali. Stronger alkalis are associated with more rapid penetration and the penetration rate increases in ascending order from calcium hydroxide, Potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide to ammonium hydroxide. Changes in aqueous humour pH are observed within a few seconds of contact with ammonium hydroxide and within 3-5 minutes after sodium hydroxide injury. Irreversible tissue damage occurs when the pH rises above 11.5.
In injuries with alkalis, cations react with the carboxyl (COOH) groups of stromal collagen and glycosa-aminoglycans. Hydration of glycosa-aminoglycans results in loss of clarity of the stroma, whereas, hydration of collagen fibrils causes distortion of trabecular meshwork and the release of prostaglandins, these sequelae combine to produce rise in intraocular pressure (IOP).
Acids:
In general, acids penetrate the corneal stroma much less readily than alkalis. The hydrogen ion mediates damage due to pH alteration, while the anion causes precipitation and denaturation of proteins in the corneal epithelium and anterior stroma. Precipitation of the epithelial proteins produces a degree of protection by providing a physical barrier against further penetration. However, when an acid penetrates the stroma, the damage to ocular structures is similar to that observed in alkali injury.
Acid injury produces:

Precipitation of extracellular glycosa-aminoglycans.
Corneal opacification.
Distortion of the trabecular meshwork.
Changes in anterior chamber pH.
Damage to anterior chamber structures.
Reduced aqueous ascorbate levels.
Vascular damage resulting in ischaemic injury.

Both acids and bases may mediate osmolar damage to the cornea. Chemical damage may initiate large changes in osmolarity, which gives rise to cellular dysfunction and destruction. There is little protection against a variety of chemical and toxic insults due to limited buffering capacity of the cornea. In the event that the buffering capacity is exceeded, there is an immediate cessation of biochemical activity e.g. protein synthesis.
Injury, repair and differentiation:
Ocular surface:
Following injury, recovery is dependent upon centripetal migration of cells from the most proximal region of viable epithelium. The extent of the injury determines the source of regenerating epithelium. Epithelial defect involving small area, or the entirety of cornea are replenished by adjacent corneal epithelium and limbus, respectively. In the event of complete corneal and limbal epithelial loss, the conjunctiva is the only source of regenerating epithelium. The source of regenerating epithelium influences the rate of re-epithelialisation and the type of restored epithelium.
Factors retarding rate of re-epithelialisation, following chemical injury:

Robust and persistent inflammatory response.
Structural damage to the epithelial basement membrane.

Non-healing corneal epithelial wounds pose a significant risk as they expose the cornea to potential microbial infection.
Stroma:
Severe chemical injuries deplete stromal keratocytes, and initiate collagenolytic process which degrade collagen fibrils. These processes disrupt structural integrity and may result in corneal ulceration and perforation. Keratocytes are important for maintenance and regeneration of the corneal stroma. Following corneal injury, keratocytes migrate into areas of damaged stroma from adjacent tissue. Keratocytes are responsible for collagen synthesis. Collagen production is maximal between days 7 and 56, with a peak at about day 21 after injury. Collagen synthesis requires ascorbate and thus, may be significantly impaired following severe chemical injury.
Inflammation:
Chemical injury to the eye is associated with release of inflammatory mediators and the infiltration of inflammatory cells into injured tissue. Regulation of this inflammatory response is crucial, since a robust and prolonged inflammatory response may affect wound healing.
Severe chemical injuries are characterised by two waves of inflammation; the first wave occurs in the first 24 hours and the second wave begins at approximately 7 days and peaks 2 to 3 weeks after injury. The intensity of the first wave may be critical for the recruitment of the second wave. The second wave of inflammation coincides with the period of maximal corneal degradation and repair, and may facilitate sterile enzymatic digestion of the corneal stroma. Sterile ulceration is associated with the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The exclusion of inflammatory cells from the corneal stroma is associated with cessation of sterile ulceration.","The severity of eye injury depends upon:

Toxicity of the Chemical.
Duration contact of chemical with eye.
Depth of penetration.
Area of involvement.

Diagnosis requires:
Clinical history: Patient should be asked for:

When the injury occurred.
Whether the eye was rinsed and for how long.
Mechanism of injury (was the chemical under pressure).
The nature of chemical.
Whether there was any eye protection or not.

Clinical Examination: 
Prior to clinical eye examination, pH of both the eyes should be checked. Eye must be irrigated to bring the pH to a safer range between 7 and 7.2.
Early assessment includes careful documentation of the extent and severity of limbal, corneal and bulbar/ palpebral conjunctival involvement, since it provides baseline reference in subsequent evaluation and treatment.
Palpebral fissures should be examined and fornices should be swept to remove a retained particulate matter, which can cause persistent damage. Eye should be examined under fluorescein dye. Intraocular pressure should be documented as well to exclude any rise.
Emergency treatment of the chemically injured eye must precede any attempt at classification. Once the condition has been stabilised, determine the anticipated course of the chemical injury by examining the critical features. Understanding and documenting the salient features of an alkali injury of the eye permits proper classification so that appropriate treatment can be initiated and accurate prognosis deduced. Photographic documentation may be obtained, if possible.

Clinical grading of chemical Injuries:
Epithelial defect: Measure the size and draw the shape of the defect after instilling 2% fluorescein dye. Include any conjunctival epithelial defects as well, particularly concerning the palisades of Vogt (limbal stem cells). Document all epithelial defects, including those extending into the fornices of the eye.
Corneal stromal opacity: Grade corneal stromal opacity on the basis of penlight examination:

Grade 0: Grade 0 is clear cornea.
Grade 1: Grade 1 has mild corneal haze.
Grade 2: Grade 2 represents mild to moderate opacity.
Grade 3: Grade 3 has moderate opacity.
Grade 4: Grade 4 represents moderate to severe opacity. Details of iris trabeculae can be seen and pupils are visible.
Grade 5: Grade 5 severe corneal opacity, pupils are not visible with penlight.

Perilimbal ischaemia: To document perilimbal ischaemia, note the clock hours where the conjunctiva is whitened. The conjunctiva and episclera are devoid of blood vessels in these areas. This whitening should not be confused with less severe injury, where there is chemosis and thrombosed blood vessels, but some of the conjunctiva is still viable. Perilimbal whitening is a useful parameter by which the extent of corneal stem cell damage, and indirectly, injury of the underlying ciliary body and trabecular meshwork, may be judged. Documentation of these findings allows for more accurate determination of the necessity for corneal stem cell transplantation.
Adnexa: Measure and document the blinking pattern, corneal exposure, and/or lagophthalmos.
These measurements and findings can be applied to the classification of alkali injuries as described by Hughes, and later modified by Ballen (1963), Roper- Hall (1965) and Pfister et al (1982). This classification, with accompanying drawings and photographs, represents the span of damage encountered after alkali injury. The accuracy of early assessment becomes important in prognostication and treatment plans.

Classification of chemical injury to the eye:
Dua (2001) provides a classification of ocular surface burns giving prognosis based on corneal appearance, conjunctival involvement and analogue scale recording the amount of limbal involvement in clock hours of affected limbus/ percentage of conjunctival involvement. The conjunctival involvement should be calculated only for the bulbar conjunctiva, up to and including the conjunctival fornices.

Grade I: In Grade I, there is 0 clock hours of limbal involvement, 0% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0/0%, and the prognosis is very good.
Grade II: In Grade II, there is less than 3 clock hours of limbal involvement, less than 30% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0.1- 3/ 1- 29.9%, and the prognosis is good.
Grade III: In Grade III, there is between 3- 6 clock hours of limbal involvement, 30- 50% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 3.1- 6/ 31- 50%, and the prognosis is good.
Grade IV: In Grade IV, there is between 6- 9 clock hours of limbal involvement, 50- 75% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 6.1- 9/ 51- 75%, and the prognosis is good to guarded.
Grade V: In Grade V, there is between 9- 12 clock hours of limbal involvement, 75- 100% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 9.1- 11.9/ 75- 100%, and the prognosis is guarded to poor.
Grade VI: In Grade VI, there is total limbal (12 clock hours) involvement, total conjunctival (100%) involvement, analogue scale reading of 12/ 100%, and the prognosis is very poor.

McCulley (1987) has divided the clinical course of chemical injury in four distinct phases:

Immediate.
Acute phase (0- 7 days).
Early reparative phase (7- 21 days).
Late reparative phase (after 21 days).

The clinical findings immediately following chemical exposure may be used to assess the severity and prognosis of the injury.
Hughes (1946) classification (modified by Ballen in 1963, Roper- Hall in 1965 and Pfister et al in 1982) provides a prognostic guideline based on corneal appearance and extent of limbal ischaemia. The Roper-hall classification system was introduced in the mid-1960s and is the most established and commonly applied system.

Grade I injury: In Grade I injury, there is corneal epithelial damage, no corneal opacity, no limbal ischaemia, and the prognosis is good.
Grade II injury: In Grade II injury, the cornea is hazy but the iris details are visible. There is also ishaemia involving less than one third of the limbus and the prognosis is good.
Grade III injury: In Grade III injury, there is total epithelial loss, stromal haze with obscuration of iris details, ischaemia of one third to one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is guarded.
Grade IV injury: In Grade IV injury, the cornea is opaque with no view of the iris or pupil, the ischaemia is greater than one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is poor.

In the acute phase (during first week), Grade I injuries heal while Grade II injuries slowly recover with corneal clarity. Grade III and Grade IV injuries have little or no epithelialisation, with no collagenolysis or vascularisation. Intraocular pressure may be elevated due to inflammation or decreased due to damage to ciliary body.
During early reparative phase (7- 21 days), in Grade II injuries, re- epithelialisation is completed with clearing of opacification. In more severe cases, there may not be a change in clinical appearance and there may be delayed or arrested re- epithelialisation. Keratocyte proliferation occurs with production of collagen and collagenase, resulting in progressive thinning with potential of perforation.
In late reparative phase, re- epithelialisation patterns divide injured eyes into two groups:

First group: In the first group, epithelialisation is complete or is nearly complete with sparing of limbal stem cells. Corneal anaesthesia, goblet cell/ mucinous abnormalities, and irregular epithelial basement membrane regeneration may persist.
Second group: In the second group, limbal stem cell damage results in corneal re- epithelialisation from conjunctival epithelium. This group has the worst prognosis with severe ocular surface damage characterised by vascularisation and scarring, goblet cell/ mucinous deficiency, and recurrent and persistent erosions. There may be cicatricial entropion (inward turning of eyelid), trichiasis (misdirected eyelashes), and symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation. A fibro-vascular pannus may form if there is no ulceration, and it compromises visual rehabilitation.

Differential diagnosis:

Thermal burns to the eyes.
Ultraviolet radiation keratitis.
Other causes of corneal opacification.
Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Preparation for vision restoration: Preparation for vision restoration must begin immediately after the injury. Deliberate and timely treatment determines successful outcomes in the rehabilitative process.
In succession, management consists of emergency treatment, pressure control, suppression of inflammation, enhancing stromal repair, and establishing eyelid-globe congruity during the early days, weeks, and months after the injury.
Topical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and topical beta blockers continue to form the mainstay of intraocular pressure control. Fibroblast inhibiting mitomycin C may improve the success of filtration surgery for glaucoma. Drainage procedures may be done if one or more filtration surgeries fail.
Operative procedures include amniotic membrane transplant, corneal epithelial stem cell transplants, keratoplasty, large-diameter lamellar keratoplasty, and keratoprosthesis.
Medical therapy:
Emergency management:

Irrigation of eyes: Emergency management requires prompt irrigation and the removal of residual chemical debris from the eye. The objectives are to minimise penetration of the chemical into the anterior chamber, and to remove a potential reservoir for ongoing injury. Immediate copious irrigation should begin at the scene of the incident and this is an important intervention. Irrigation with the lids kept open should be initiated and maintained at least for 30 minutes, which may require 1- 2 liters of solution. Irrigation should be continued until pH neutralisation is achieved. Patients with immediate copious irrigation have less severe injury, as compared to eyes which are not irrigated. Although there may be an advantage in the use of amphoteric buffering solution, any available neutral irrigation solution may be used in emergency. Solutions available for irrigation include normal saline, normal saline with bicarbonate, Ringer’s lactate, balanced salt solution (BSS), and BSS- plus. No therapeutic differences have been noted among these solutions. After copious irrigation, necrotic corneal epithelium should be débrided to promote re-epithelialisation.
Where possible, topical anaesthetic drops should be instilled to reduce pain and blepharospasm, thereby facilitating irrigation. Remove all particulate matter, and this may require eyelid eversion (double eversion may be necessary) and cleaning of the fornices. Lime particles should be removed with forceps and a cotton-tipped applicator soaked in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) may help with the removal of stubborn particles. Few patients may require general anaesthetic or sedation to effectively remove particulate matter.
Aqueous humour replacement: External irrigation is of limited value in eliminating chemicals once they have reached the anterior chamber. Role of paracentesis (removal of aqueous from anterior chamber) and irrigation of the anterior chamber is controversial. Nonetheless, it may be reasonable to consider aqueous humour replacement in patients with severe injuries presenting within first two hours following exposure.

Acute and Reparative phases:
After irrigation, better outcomes may be expected with prompt re-epithelialisation, while delayed or absent re-epithelialisation may require surgical intervention.

Corticosteroid therapy: Intensive corticosteroid therapy during first two weeks decreases the inflammatory response (which can delay epithelial migration), and thus enhances re-epithelialisation. Corticosteroids use during first 10 days of injury has no adverse effect on outcome. Prolonged use of corticosteroids beyond two weeks may lead to stromal ulceration, since steroids blunt stromal wound repair by decreasing keratocyte migration and collagen synthesis.
Medroxyprogesterone: Medroxyprogesterone is a pogestational steroid that has weak anti- inflammatory activity as compared to corticosteroids. Medroxyprogesterone inhibits collagenase but, unlike corticosteroids, minimally suppresses stromal wound repair. Medroxyprogesterone may be substituted for corticosteroid after two weeks if worsening corneal ulceration is of concern.
Topical and systemic sodium ascorbate (10%): Topical and systemic sodium ascorbate (10%) replenish depleted levels from the aqueous humour, following injury with alkali. Ascorbate is a cofactor in the rate- limiting step of collagen synthesis, and thus decreases the incidence of stromal ulceration. The molecular events responsible for the failure of collagen to assemble properly occur because of the deficiency of the reducing agent ascorbate.
Topical Citrate (10%): Topical buffered citrate is a calcium chelator that decreases intracellular levels of calcium in neutrophils and thus impairs chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and release of lysosomal enzymes. Topical citrate also reduces corneal ulceration and perforation of eye.
Oral tetracyclines: Oral tetracyclines offer protection against collagenolytic degradation.

Topical antibiotics may be required to prevent superadded infections. Cycloplegics provide comfort to the eye. Artificial tears, preferably preservative free, may provide general lubrication for ocular comfort.

Surgical therapy:
Surgical intervention that may help stabilising the ocular surface in severe chemical injury includes:

Tenonplasty: Tenonplasty attempts to re-establish limbal vascularity in severe injuries and to promote re- epithelialisation. In this, all necrotic conjunctival and episcleral tissues are excised. Tenon’s capsule is dissected with blunt instrument, and the resultant flap with its preserved blood supply is advanced to the limbus.
Tissue adhesives (tissue glue): Tissue adhesives preserve integrity in the event of corneal thinning with impending or actual perforation of the globe. This is usually accompanied by the application of a soft bandage contact lens, which prevents glue dislodgement. Tissue glue can stop further melting by excluding inflammatory cells and their mediators. Tissue adhesives also provide a means of delaying penetrating keratoplasty.
Amniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation may be used as supplement to surgical procedures where coverage of raw surfaces or suppression of inflammation is required. Amniotic membrane has anti-angiogenic (inhibitors of blood vessels growth) and anti-inflammatory proteins capable of suppressing the inflammatory response. Amniotic membrane can create a new basement membrane and promote epithelial healing. Amniotic membrane might be applied very early after a chemical injury following emergency services, usually weeks later. Despite benefits, amniotic membrane cannot replace the need for corneal stem cells.
Corneal stem cell transplantation: Replacement of the corneal stem cells lost due to injury is important in the restoration of an intact and normal corneal epithelial cell layer. These primitive, slow-cycling stem cells are located in the limbal area. 

Monocular injuries allow for procurement of stem cells from the uninjured eye. When the injury is bilateral, Pfister (1993) showed that allografted limbal tissue was capable of restoring the stem cell population from an unrelated donor. Allografted corneal stem cells must be protected from the recipient immune process by systemic immune-suppression e.g. cyclosporine.

Corneal transplantation (Keratoplasty):

 Success in restorative corneal surgery is governed by:
- Lid-globe congruity with normal blinking and the absence of corneal exposure. Preparatory procedures to lyse symblepharon, expand cul-de-sacs, and to eliminate lagophthalmos are often required to re-establish normal lid functioning.
- Quality and quantity of tear film.
- The presence of epithelial stem cells phenotypic for cornea.
- The absence of any current ulceration, inflammation, and/or uncontrolled glaucoma. Secondary glaucoma must also be controlled with medications or filtration surgery.
- Flawless surgical technique.
- Fresh corneal transplant tissue.
The value of preoperative use of LASER for blood vessels at the limbus in high-risk patients is controversial, but at least it reduces bleeding at the time of surgery.
If corneal surgery is delayed 18 months to 2 years after a chemical burn, it increases the chances of success, especially without pre-existing ulceration, perforation, or glaucoma.
Penetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty refers to the full- thickness replacement of the affected cornea with a healthy donor. Penetrating keratoplasty may be used to provide tectonic support (such as in corneal thinning and perforation), and to improve visual outcome (such as in the replacement of corneal scarring).
Large-diameter penetrating keratoplasty: Replacement of the entire cornea and adjacent stem cells by large-diameter penetrating keratoplasty may be performed. One potential danger might be that such large transplants might interfere with the trabecular outflow channels and hence increase the likelihood of glaucoma. Proximity to the limbal blood vessels makes an immune rejection more likely.
Large-diameter lamellar keratoplasty: A very promising technique in corneal transplantation for chemical injuries includes the use of 12 or 13 mm lamellar corneal transplants, along with the limbal epithelial stem cell population. Smaller lamellar transplants are useful to fill in deep corneal ulcerations, descemetoceles, or frank corneal perforations.

Keratoprosthesis (Artificial cornea): In the most severe cases, implantation of a keratoprosthesis might afford the only means by which vision can be restored.

Indications for keratoprosthesis are:
- Corneas exhibiting exuberant vascularity.
- Repeated failures of fresh transplanted corneal tissue.
- Chronic limbal stem cell deficiency.
- Inability to restore normal lid anatomy.
The operation is usually advised in patients with severe bilateral injuries where serviceable vision is not present in either eye. A surprising degree of success may be achieved with keratoprosthesis. Critical to the visual outcome of a keratoprosthesis is the control of intraocular pressure at all times after the chemical injury.

Conjunctival transplantation: Conjunctival transplantation is a means of restoring conjunctival fornices following fibrosis. This provides compatible tissue with a basement membrane, unlike other mucosal replacements. The procedure involves taking a sample of upper bulbar conjunctiva from the contralateral (other uninvolved) eye.
Buccal and Nasal mucosa transplant: Buccal mucosa grafts may be used to treat symblepharon (adhesion between bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva), trichiasis (misdirected eyelashes), distichiasis (partial or complete second row of eyelashes), or entropion. The graft is usually obtained from the posterior aspect of the upper or lower lip. The advantage of nasal mucosal grafts lies in the ability to obtain large sized grafts.


Stages of ocular recovery following chemical injury (Colby, 2010):

Initial phase (day 0): Clinical findings relate to the severity of injury and can be graded according to degree of limbal, corneal and conjunctival involvement.
Acute phase (day 0- 7): Epithelial re-growth begins to occur if there is sufficient amount of undamaged limbal stem cells. Treatment should be directed at encouraging growth while suppressing inflammation.
Phase of early repair (days 7- 21): Corneal/ conjunctival epithelium and keratocytes proliferate during this stage. Mild injuries show complete re-epithelialisation while more severe injuries can have persistent epithelial defects. Activity of collagenases peaks by day 14- 21 while collagen synthesis continues. Treatment should attempt to maximise collagen synthesis while minimising collagenase activity.
Phase of late repair (after day 21): In mild injuries, where the limbal stem cell population is intact, repair is completed. In injuries, where there is focal stem cell loss, there may be a focal growth of conjunctiva on the cornea. In more severe injuries, there is delayed re-epithelialisation of the cornea, ultimately leading to either repopulation by conjunctival epithelium or stromal ulceration and permanent scarring. In cases of severe limbal damage, despite optimal management, the eye cannot be salvaged.


Management of exposure to lacrimatory agents:

Tear gas and Chemical Mace: Following exposure to tear gas and Chemical Mace, thorough rinsing/ irrigation provides immense relief.
Pepper spray (Oleoresin capsicum): Irrigation with fresh water, although recommended, has little effect as capsicin is not soluble in water. Flushing the eye with a solution containing half liquid antacid (of aluminium or magnesium hydroxide base) and half water (LAW) is more effective.
Mustard gas (Dichlorodiethyl sulphide): Prompt irrigation of eyes with running water or normal saline is useful. Topical antibiotic, cycloplegic and lubricant may be used for associated corneal erosions.

Exposure to chemicals used for festivals in India also requires thorough rinsing/ irrigation with running water or normal saline for relief.

Prognosis:
The prognosis for severe injury is typically poor and may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium, cornea and anterior segment. However, in recent years, the prognosis of severe ocular burns has improved, with advances in the understanding of the physiology of the cornea and the resultant development of enhanced medical and surgical treatments. The final visual prognosis is influenced by:

The nature of the chemical insult.
The extent of ocular damage.
The timing and efficacy of treatment."
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov,"A cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019. On 7 January, Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as 2019-nCoV. Afterwards on 11February 2020, this virus is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease is named as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO).
To date, other six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. Out of these, four are globally circulated in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans. The other two viruses are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS Coronavirus) causing severe respiratory diseases. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, are zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals (civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively) to humans.
(SARS-CoV was first reported in 2002-2003 in Guangdong, China and MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012).
The precise zoonotic (animal) origin of the 2019‑nCoV is still uncertain. The virus has been identified in environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and some human cases have been epidemiologically linked to this market.
Epidemiological evidence shows that 2019‑nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another. In the previous outbreaks of other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS, human-to-human transmission occurred most commonly through droplets, personal contact, and contaminated objects. The modes of transmission of 2019‑nCoV are similar.
According to WHO, additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the geographic range of infection.
On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of WHO declared the 2019‑nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005).
COVID-19 outbreak was declared as pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. According to WHO it is a controllable pandemic and urged all countries to take a comprehensive approach considering their circumstances and with containment measures as the central pillar.

Key Messages and Actions for COVID-19 Prevention and Control in Schools","Common symptoms of infection may be in the form of respiratory symptoms such as-

fever,
cough,
shortness of breath and
breathing difficulties.

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
Symptoms may appear2-14 days after exposureto the virus.
Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are high risk groups of developing serious illness.
People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately.","A novel coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that can cause mild illness in the form of common cold to severe respiratory diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, it means they can be transmitted between animals and people. Previous investigations showed that other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans.
The precise origin of the 2019‑nCoV is still uncertain. The virus has been identified in environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and some human cases have been epidemiologically linked to this market.
Mode of transmission:
Epidemiological evidence shows that 2019‑nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another. In the previous outbreaks of other coronaviruses such as Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred most commonly through droplets, personal contact, and contaminated objects. The modes of transmission of 2019‑nCoV are likely to be similar.
The 2019-nCoV can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household, workplace, or health care centre.","Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19 diagnosis: tests for current infection (viral tests-molecular assays) and tests for past infection (antibody tests/serology tests).
Molecular assays:2019-nCoV can be diagnosed by molecular assays in samples from upper respiratory tract collected as nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and from lower respiratory tract by sputum (if possible for those patients with productive coughs) and or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with more severe respiratory diseases.
Molecular based tests consist of real time RT-PCR, TrueNAAT/CBNAAT. It only indicates the presence of viral material during infection and do not indicate if a person was infected and subsequently recovered.
Proper infection control measures should be maintainedwhen collecting specimens.
Serology tests: These are blood-based tests used to identify people who have been exposed to COVID-19 virus by looking at their immune response. These tests are used for surveillance purposes to know about the prevalence of a disease in a population by identifying individuals who have developed antibodies to the virus.
An antibody test may not be able to show a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks after infection to make antibodies.
National Institute of Virology, Pune, India is among the various laboratories have been identified internationally to provide reference testing support for 2019-nCoV.

Computer Vision Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/computer-vision-syndrome,"Computer vision syndrome (CVS), also referred to as digital eye strain,describes eye and vision-related problems that result from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader and cell phone use. Many individuals experience eye discomfort and vision problems when viewing digital screens. The level of discomfort appears to increase with the amount of digital screen use.
The main visual symptoms reported by visual display terminal (VDT) users include eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, burning sensation, redness, blurred vision, and double vision, thus termed the phrase ‘computer vision syndrome’ (CVS). Vision problems and symptoms associated with the use of the eyes are the most frequently occurring health problems among VDT users. CVS not only causes pain and discomfort to the individual, but also reduces overall efficiency by reducing the time that a person can effectively work.
Majority of VDT patients had symptoms that were different than other near-point workers, especially as related to glare, lighting, and spectacle requirements. Greater frequency and severity of symptoms were also noted. One study shows higher degree of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) in symptomatic computer users than in computer users who have lesser degrees of ocular surface complaints.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the US Government (OSHA) has defined CVS as a ‘complex of eye and vision problems that are experienced during and related to computer use; it is repetitive strain disorder that appears to be growing rapidly, with some studies estimating that 90% US workers using computers from more than three hours per day experience CVS in some form’ (Nilsen, 2005). Anshel (2006) have defined CVS as the ‘complex of eye and vision problems related to near work, which are experienced during or related to computer use’. Chakrabarti (2007) defined CVS as the ‘excessive viewing of visual display terminal (VDT) screens without proper attention to practical visual hygiene’. The American Optometric Association (AOA) has defined CVS as ‘a complex of eye and vision problems related to activities, which stress the near vision and which are experienced in relation or during the use of computers’. It has now been concluded that CVS is characterised by visual symptoms which result from interaction with a computer display or its environment. In most cases the symptoms occur because the visual demands of the task exceed the visual abilities of the individual for comfortable performance of task.
Office work involves a range of activities including typing, reading, and writing. Each activity was adequately varied in the requirements of posture and vision. Computers have combined these tasks to where most can be performed without moving from the desktop, thereby improving quality, production, and efficiency. The popularity and affordability of personal computers with the internet capabilities at home introduced more computer users.
Studies have not clearly indicated a negative effect on computer user due to radiation levels from VDTs. VDTs are known to emit many types of radiation, including soft X-radiation, optical radiation, radiofrequency radiation, very low frequency radiation, and extremely low frequency radiation. Most women in offices, who work with VDTs, do not increase their risk of miscarriage.
It may well be that high computer usage raises the number of dry eye sufferers and/or increases the severity of symptoms, but studies have not produced any direct comparison of groups that would allow us to conclude that computer use bears a long- term causal relation to ocular surface disease. There needs to be more prospective studies to elucidate direct relationship between ocular surface disease (e.g. MGD) and CVS.","Symptoms of CVS may include:

Dry eyes.
Even watering of eyes by some computer users.
Eyestrain.
Redness.
Burning sensation.
Blurred vision.
Double vision.
Foreign body or gritty sensation.
Blurred distant vision even after work.
Headache.
Musculo-skeletal problems such as pain in neck, back pain, and shoulder problems.

The symptoms may be aggravated by poor lighting, improper work station design, uncorrected refractive errors, glare, bad posture and long periods of sitting. Playing electronic games for long periods, especially in children has also been linked to obesity.","Risk factors for CVS include:
I. Factors influencing surface disease: 
There are several factors that contribute to CVS and dry eye syndrome (DES). They include the following:

Environmental factors: The cornea is very sensitive to drying and chemical imbalances from environmental factors such as dry air, ventilation fans, electrostatic build up, airborne paper dust, laser and photocopy toner, and building contaminants.
Reduced blink rate: Most individuals blink normally 10- 15 times/ minute. Studies have shown that the blink rate at the computer is significantly less. A reduced blink rate at the VDT contributes to a poor-quality tear film and temporary as well as long-term stress upon the cornea and ocular surface. This results in symptoms of DES.
Duration of computer use: Longer duration of the computer work tends to result in long-lasting complaints that persist, even when the work is completed.
Height and inclination of monitor: Increased odds ratio (eye strain) for certain eye symptoms is observed when the computer monitor is kept at about the eye level instead of below the eye level. The VDT should be at least 5 to 6 inches below the straight line of the viewer’s vision. Such measures reduce not only dry eye, but also the severity of the spasm of neck muscles. OSHA has recommended that the center of computer monitor should normally be located 15 to 20 cm below the horizontal eye level and that the entire visual area of the display screen should be located such that the downward viewing angle is greater than 60 degrees.
Taking frequent breaks: Taking frequent breaks from computer use is shown to increase the efficiency because the breaks relax eye accommodative system, thus decreasing eye fatigue and headache.
Distance of VDT from the eyes: Distance of VDT from the eyes is an important risk factor for CVS. Closer the VDT to the eyes, it is more difficult for the eyes to accommodate. Excess accommodation results in overwork on ciliary muscles which manifest as eye fatigue and headache.
Increased exposure due to position of monitor: Normally reading of text on paper is done while looking downwards and it results in the eyelid covering a good deal of the front surface of the eye. This covering minimises the evaporation of tears. On the other hand, computer users look at their reading material in straight ahead gaze. This result in a wider opening between the eyelids, and an increased surface area exposed to the effects of evaporation.
Gender: The prevalence of DES is twice as frequent in females as compared to males.
Age: Tear production normally decreases with age. Although DES can occur at any age in both men and women.
Menopause: Hormonal changes have been identified as contributing to DES. Postmenopausal women represent the group of individuals affected most by DES. Sometimes it is difficult to assess the relative contributions of menopause and ageing.
Systemic diseases and disease syndromes: DES is associated with various systemic diseases. In the case of Sjӧgren’s syndrome, dry mouth and rheumatoid arthritis can assist in making the diagnosis. Several autoimmune diseases also have association with DES.
Systemic medications: There are several systemic medications which contribute to ocular drying. Most prominent among them are diuretics, antihistamines, and anti-hypertensives.
Spectacle wear: CVS with eye redness has significant association with the use of spectacles.
Contact lens wear: Contact lens comfort is highly dependent on the fit of the lens and lubrication of the eye. If the eye is dry, the lenses dry easily and adhere to the upper eyelid during the blink. This ‘friction effect’ from DES produces discomfort.
Cosmetics: Cosmetics may block the openings of the oil-secreting meibomian glands and create debris and inflammation. This leads to rapid evaporation of the water component of the tear film and deposition of foreign bodies from cosmetics in the tear film or on the ocular surface with resultant discomfort.
Cholesterol: There may be statistically significant decreased prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in patients with moderate to severe MGD. The cause of this is unknown, but the findings suggest that elevated HDL may be a risk factor for the development of MGD, despite being known as ‘good cholesterol’ with its cardio-protective effects.

II. Visual effects of display features: 

Display quality: Visual performance is affected by a number of display parameters, such as character size, structure, and style; and by image contrast and stability.

The images produced on a VDT consists of thousands of tiny, bright spots (pixels) or horizontal lines (rasters), which collectively form unresolved images that blur together and lack sharp edges. The more the dots or lines displayed on a monitor to produce a picture, the sharper and clearer the image will appear. With time, the resolution of monitors has improved drastically, producing displays approaching that of typeset documents.
Many factors affect readability and legibility of characters on the screen. Words containing upper case in combination with lower case are more easily interpreted than all upper case documents. The spacing between characters and lines also affects picture quality. High levels of contrast and brightness are known to represent the most common causes of character blur. Screens should contain dark characters against a light background display screen, rather than the opposite. Switches from a light background hard copy to dark background display causes fatigue of the iris muscle.

Lighting and glare: Improper lighting conditions of a workstation can also adversely affect ocular comfort. Constant and bright illumination from surrounding sources of light creates reflection and glare. These problems do not produce chronic visual disorders but are sources of annoyance and possibly visual fatigue.

In cases where it is not practical to reduce surrounding light, reduction of reflections and increase in contrast may be obtained from antiglare filters.
Recent studies demonstrate differing results in the efficacy of symptoms relief with screen filters. One recent study revealed that people who used a screen filter reported less occurrence, shorter duration, and less intensive eye and musculoskeletal complaints after one month of use. It was concluded that screen filters could improve the conditions for visual perception and thus relieve eyestrain. Another study showed that filters by themselves do not reduce the occurrence of asthenopia (rapid fatigue of the eyes). More research is needed to determine whether screen filters are effective in the relief of ocular symptoms.

Refresh rates: The refresh rate of a VDT represents the number of times per minute (measured in Hertz) the screen is repainted to produce an image. If the refresh rate is too slow, the characters on the screen may appear to flicker. Perceived flicker has resulted in subjective complaints of annoyance, fatigue, and headache. The critical fusion frequency is the refresh rate at which humans can no longer distinguish the pulsating beams of light as separate entities. In most viewing situations, this rate is 30- 50 Hertz.

Studies have shown that much higher refresh rates may decrease ocular symptoms and increase user functionality.

Radiation: The potential of health risk concerns that radiation emissions from VDTs could be responsible for hazardous effects to the computer user. However, VDTs neither produce nor emit alpha, beta, gamma, or hard X-radiation. Small amount of soft X-rays is produced, but almost all of the radiation is contained by the glass screen of the monitor.

Numerous studies have shown that there is no evidence to support that VDT operators face health hazards or have exposure to electric, magnetic, or ionizing radiation fields significantly above ambient levels.

Pathophysiology:
Eye focusing mechanism in human beings responds well to images with well defined edges with good background and contrast between the background and letters. Visual work on computer involves continuous muscular activity and it includes frequent saccadic eye movements (ocular motility), accommodation (focusing) and vergence (alignment demands).
Characters on computer screen are made up of tiny dots called pixels. Each pixel is bright at its center and decreases in brightness towards the outer edges. This causes electronic characters to have blurred edges as compared to letters on a paper with sharply defined edges. This makes very difficult for eye to maintain focus on pixels, and the eye relaxes to focus behind the screen. This is called the resting point of accommodation (RPA) or dark focus. Thus, eye constantly relaxes to RPA and strains to refocus on to the screen thereby leading to eyestrain.","Diagnosis depends upon the symptoms being faced by the patients and the clinical features.
A complete ocular surface examination is imperative to rule out local and systemic features associated with DES, blepharitis, inflammation, and lid margin disease. Patients with significant aqueous deficiency with basal or Schirmer test 1 value less than 5 mm should be evaluated.
CVS and meibomian gland disease (MGD):
The rate at which people blink decreases by more than 60% when they stare at a computer screen, suggesting that the acute decrease in blinks can acutely increase symptoms of Dry eye syndrome (DES) or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS).Computer users often complain that their eyes feel dry, burning, gritty, or heavy after an extended period at VDT. Their eyes may even reflexively tear in an attempt to properly lubricate and rewet the front surface of the eye. DES may be a primary cause of ocular fatigue, such as experienced when using a VDT, where the blink rate is decreased and the exposed ocular surface area is increased. Blink rate is decreased further in dark where it is difficult to read.
The tear film, which overlies and protects the cornea, consists of, from anterior surface inward, a lipid layer, an aqueous gel layer, and a mucin layer. DES results from evaporation of the aqueous component. The lipid surface layer protects the aqueous layer from evaporation. It is secreted as meibum by the meibomian glands embedded in the eyelids. The normal physiological mechanism of meibum secretion is associated with blink reflex. The normal blink expresses meibum from the glands and spreads it evenly on top of the aqueous layer. Several studies have shown that computer use produces considerable reduction of the spontaneous blink rate. Hence, computer use reduces meibum secretion and exposes tear film to increased aqueous evaporation. Because the tear film is maintained by a balance of secretion of the lipid meibum layer and the aqueous layer, reduction of secretion of either results in a tear film imbalance that can lead to symptoms and signs of DES.
An immediate reduction in blink rate acutely alters the ocular surface because it causes poor tear spreading and dessication. Longer term reduction of blinking may alter meibomian gland. Eventually, MGD may worsen, causing further reduction of the outflow of meibum, alteration in the normal bacterial flora, increase in inflammation, and obstruction of the glands. Thus, reduced blink rate at the computer contributes to poor tear film quality and increased evaporation, which reduces the overall efficiency and comfort of work. Furthermore, the positive correlation between lifetime computer usage and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score shows that people who use the computer tend to have more significant ocular surface symptoms.
CVS and asthenopia:
Many individuals have marginal vision disorders, such as difficulties with accommodation, or binocular vision problems that do not cause symptoms when performing less demanding visual tasks.
Use of VDT creates asthenopia or a feeling of ocular discomfort or tiredness. In fact, symptomatic visual complaints were reported by 75% of VDT operators working 6-9 hours in front of their screens compared to 50% of the other workers (Mutti et al. 1996).
After working with the monitor, the most important changes are:

Diminished power of accommodation.
Removal of the near point of convergence.
Deviation or phoria for near vision.

These results suggest that the weakness of important visual functions could be the cause of eyestrain in computer operators. Prolonged work at a VDT has been reported to result in changes in both relative accommodation and vergence.
One study noted a high prevalence of exophoria, convergence insufficiency, and low fusional convergence among VDT workers. They also found that the accommodative amplitude decreased significantly more for VDT users than for non-users.
VDTs are a major source of near work for many adults, but do not appear to result in losses of accommodative and vergence functions beyond the ordinary effects of age.
CVS and transient myopia:
Accommodative effort during near work is thought to be a causative factor in the development of myopia. It is clear that near work with VDTs result in a small, temporary myopic shift. In a cross-sectional comparison of VDT users and typists, VDT users experienced a myopic shift of about -0.12 Diopters after the work period, while the refractive error of typists was unchanged.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
The treatment of CVS requires a multidirectional approach due to the variety of complaints by the users. When treating a patient, it is important to consider ocular therapy as well as adjustment of workstation and habits of users.
Local ocular surface disorders should be treated aggressively and on a long term basis. Eye care providers and patients need to understand the chronicity of this disorder in order to maintain compliance to treatment.
Treatment includes: 
Restoring aqueous deficiencies with 
- Lubrication.
- Partial or complete punctal occlusion.
Short- and long- term inflammation control with 
- Topical steroids.
- Omega 3.
- Topical cyclosporine A.
Isolation technique, that is, microenvironment glasses (MEGS) or specialised contact lenses, are helpful if the patients are moderately to severely symptomatic or have significant findings of dry eye or lid margin disease on clinical examination.


VDT positioning: Computer users often assume uncomfortable positions in order to properly view the screen which leads to pain. It is thus important to keep monitor at proper distance and height.

Previously, it was recommended that the eye should be 16- 30 inches from the screen. Recent data suggest that further distances may be more favourable to ocular symptoms. These studies suggest that distances of 35- 40 inches may produce fewer complaints of visual strain.
It is recommended that the screen should be placed 10-20˚ below (or the middle of the screen 5- 6 inches below) the eye level. When the screen is higher than this level, VDT users often tilt back their heads, causing muscle strain in the neck. Lowering the monitor allows the VDT user to gaze downward, thus exposing less ocular surface to ambient air and reducing tear film loss.

Lighting: Proper lighting within the computer workstation area improve visual comfort and performance while eliminating annoyance and visual fatigue. An ideal environment would allow equalised brightness throughout the visual field. Intense fluorescent lights can be diminished by removing a few of them. Excessive window lighting should be filtered with blinds, window coverings, or window tinting.

The actual type of lighting also appears to be important. One study focused on the visual work capacity with different sources of illumination. It was found that sodium lamps were the most adequate for high functional capacity of the visual analyser.
It is important to position the light carefully so that it does not throw bright light into the eyes.
Antiglare filters may not reduce symptoms of asthenopia, but have been shown to reduce glare and improve contrast from the screen. This provides an effective means to eliminate reflections and therefore improve visual comfort.

Work breaks: It is shown that when regular breaks are implemented, work efficiency improves, which compensates for the time lost during the break. Short frequent breaks decrease in worker discomfort and increase in productivity compared to the historical 15-minute morning and afternoon breaks. A quick walk around the office provides stretching of strained and fatigued muscles and gives relaxation.

Long periods of work without breaks are thought to be detrimental to ocular symptoms. Frequent breaks are recommended to restore and relax the accommodative system, thereby preventing eyestrain. It is believed that looking away at a distant object at least twice in an hour during computer usage is sufficient for prevention of visual fatigue.

Lubricating eye drops: Lubricating eye drops relieve the symptoms of dry eyes due to decreased blink rates. A tear substitute can periodically rewet the ocular surface, contribute to tear volume, and maintain the proper balance of salts and acidity while viewing a terminal. One study shows that higher viscosity eye drops may be more beneficial than balanced salt solutions. They normalised the inter-blink interval and relieved ocular discomfort more efficiently than balanced salt solutions following VDT use.
Cyclosporine A drops: While artificial tears are effective, cyclosporine A drops may be needed long term to effectively treat chronic ocular surface inflammation.


Omega 3 and topical steroids have also been used for control of inflammation.

Computer eye glasses: Studies show that it is effective to reduce evaporation rate by providing a physical barrier to air currents, evaporation, and an increased relative humidity via an enclosed environment with glasses. Isolation techniques with swim or workshop goggles or modified spectacles surrounding the eye decrease entry of particulate matter and prevent desiccation.

Occasional computer viewers may be able to get away with using their general eyewear, but those who spend several hours a day, may benefit from the use of micro-environment glasses (MEGS). MEGS, unlike swim goggles, can be optically modified and still create an increase in humidified microenvironment that successfully reduces dry eye symptoms and signs as well as symptoms in symptomatic computer users.
Presbyopes need the right format of eyewear. Conventional bifocals are designed for viewing at 16 inches at an angle of 20˚ below primary gaze. Computer screens are usually 24 inches away and only slightly below primary gaze. Occupational progressive lenses are now available, which incorporate a large area in the top half of the lens for mid-distance viewing (i.e. VDT) and a bottom half of the lens for near distance (i.e. keyboard and desktop). Some lenses even contain a small area for distance viewing, usually at the top of the lens.

Partial or complete punctal occlusion: Partial or complete punctal occlusion may be resorted to restore aqueous deficiencies."
Child maltreatment (child abuse),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/paediatric/child-maltreatment-child-abuse,"Child maltreatment is abuse to children under 18 years of age by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (e.g., clergy, coach, teacher). World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power. Child maltreatment can be distinguished in to:
Physical abuse, that is intentional use of physical force against a child such as inflicting physical injury by hitting, beating, shaking, biting, scalding, burning, kicking, poisoning and suffocating.
Sexual abuse involves engaging a child in sexual acts. It includes fondling, rape, and exposing a child to other sexual activities.
Emotional and psychological abuse refers to behaviors that harm a child’s self-worth or emotional well-being such as name calling, shaming, rejection, withholding love, and threatening.
Neglect is the failure to meet a child’s basic needs. These needs include housing, food, clothing, education, and access to medical care.
Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious life-long consequences. International studies reveal that 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused. Additionally, many children are subject to emotional abuse (sometimes referred to as psychological abuse) and to neglect. Every year, there are an estimated 41000 homicide deaths in children below 15 years of age (WHO).
In Asia due to high population density, poverty, illiteracy, caste system and landlessness, lack of economic opportunities, rural-urban migration, population growth, political instability and weak implementation of legal provisions the issues of child labour and child sexual exploitation are high.
According to the 2011 Census, some 470 million people in the country are aged below eighteen years and constitute 41 percent of India's total population. Problem of child abuse is prevalent in India as in many other countries and there was a need to understand its dimensions and complexities. Study on child abuse: India 2005*, was conducted by Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India. In the study group physical abuse was found in 69% of child respondents, sexual abuse in 53% children and emotional abuse in 48% children.
(*child abuse: physical abuse, sexual abuse and emotional abuse and girl child neglect in five different evidence groups-children in a family environment, children in school, children at work, children on the street and children in institutions).
Now that the scale and impact of all forms of violence against children is becoming better known, children must be provided with the effective prevention and protection to which they have an unqualified right.","Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Symptoms can be physical, psychological, or both.
Physical signs:

unexplained bruises on the face, throat, upper arms, buttocks, thighs or lower back in unusual patterns or shapes,
unexplained burns, cigarette burns, especially burns found on palms, soles of feet, abdomen, buttocks; immersion burns producing ""stocking"" or ""glove"" marks on hands and feet; ""doughnut shaped"" on buttocks or genital area,
infected burns indicating delay in treatment; burns in the shape of common household utensils or appliances.

Children who are sexually abused may:

stay away from certain people,
show sexual behaviour that's inappropriate for their age,
have physical symptoms.

If a child looks or acts as older than their age or, a child develops more slowly than others of similar age with no physical or learning disability this could be cause of concern.
Along with physical signs certain general symptoms may be:
Withdrawn, behave differently, anxious, depressed, problem sleeping, eating disorders, wets the bed, soil the clothes, take risks, misses school, changing in eating habits, obsessive behavior, nightmares ,drug and alcohol misuse.","Some factors can increase the risk for abuse or neglect. The presence of these factors does not always mean that maltreatment will occur.
Risk factors for victimization: Child

Children younger than 4 years of age or an adolescent,
unwanted, or failing to fulfill the expectations of parents,
special needs that may increase caregiver burden (e.g., disabilities, mental retardation, and chronic physical illnesses).

Risk Factors for Perpetration: 
Individual Risk Factors: Parent or caregiver

A number of characteristics of a parent or caregiver may increase the risk of child maltreatment. These include:
having been maltreated themselves as a child,
misusing alcohol or drugs, including during pregnancy,
physical/mental illness such as depression or post-traumatic disorder,
being involved in criminal activity,
parents' lack of understanding of children's needs, child development and parenting skills,
parental characteristics such as young age, low education, single parenthood, large number of dependent children, and low income,
non-biological, transient caregivers in the home (e.g., mother’s male partner).

Family environment: Relationship difficulties within families or among intimate partners, friends and peers may increase the risk of child maltreatment. These include:

physical, developmental or mental health problems of a family member,
family breakdown or violence between other family members,
being isolated in the community or lacking a support network,
a breakdown of support in child rearing from the extended family.

Community and societal factors: A number of characteristics of communities and societies may increase the risk of child maltreatment. These include:

gender and social inequality,
lack of adequate housing or services to support families and institutions,
high levels of unemployment or poverty,
the easy availability of alcohol and drugs,
on-going community violence, and weak social connections between neighbours,
social and cultural norms that promote or glorify violence towards others, support the use of corporal punishment, demand rigid gender roles, or diminish the status of the child in parent–child relationships.","If there is suspicion of child abuse a detailed account of the events leading to the injury should be obtained and documented. The child should be fully undressed, and the whole body should be examined thoroughly, including the anogenital region. The growth parameters should also be measured. Child abuse may be suspected when-

The injury is unusual or is not likely to be an accident, especially for the child's age.
The parents or caregivers say no one saw the injury happen.
Similar injuries or patterns of neglect have occurred in the past also.
The parents or caregivers are reluctant to take medical advice.
The parents or caregivers don't have a good explanation, or the explanation changes.
The doctor finds signs ofsexual abuse.

The following tests can reveal type of injuries-

Blood tests for detecting bleeding disorder or organ damage
Eye examination
Specialized test for samples taken such as skin, hair, fluid
Bone X-ray- all of the child bones, including the skull,
Ultrasonography
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or CT scan(computerized tomography)","If child abuse is suspected, report it immediately to concerned person.
Early detection of child maltreatment and early intervention can help to minimize the likelihood of further violence and the long-term health and social consequences.
Medical management can range from inpatient care to outpatient treatment with close follow-up by a physician, a social worker, and child protective services."

Corneal Abrasion,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/corneal-abrasion,"Corneal Abrasion is superficial disruption of corneal epithelial surface, usually produced by trauma. Many corneal abrasions, are prevented due to inherent brisk protective reflexes, like closure of eyelids. Corneal abrasion is also prone to infection, like any other soft tissue injury. Corneal abrasions are more common among older children who wear contact lenses for visual improvement.
Cornea is important for normal vision. Scarring or corneal opacity may affect vision. Corneal abrasions may be prevented by wearing protective glasses, while performing activities which may put eyes at risk of injury.","Symptoms of corneal abrasion include

Pain
Sensitivity to light (Photophobia)

Chalcosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/chalcosis,"Chalcosis or chalcosis bulbi refers to mild ocular inflammation due to an intraocular foreign body containing copper between about 70 to 85%. Chalcosis results in deposition of copper on lens capsule (sunflower cataract), Descemet’s membrane (Kayser- Fleischer ring), iris (green discolouration), sluggish pupillary response, vitreous degeneration and liquefaction, yellow retinal plaques and degeneration.
The intensity of inflammatory response due to copper containing foreign body depends upon the copper content. It may lead to

Severe endophthalmitis if copper content is more than 85%
Chalcosis if less than 85%

Foreign body containing less than 70% is relatively inert in the eye.
Chalcosis may be acute or chronic.

Acute Chalcosis: Intraocular copper containing foreign bodies may produce purulent, sterile inflammatory response, which can arise within few days and lead to severe necrosis or abscess formation.
Chronic Chalcosis: Intraocular foreign body, if not removed by operation or is too large to dissolve spontaneously, may lead to severe intraocular degenerative changes.

Intraocular copper rarely may be resorbed, but a longstanding Chalcosis may produce similar clinical features as are seen in Wilson’s disease (hepato-lenticular degeneration) with endogenous copper deposition. This includes characteristic Kayser-Fleischer ring and sunflower cataract (impregnation of copper within lens capsule in the pupillary area).
Intraocular foreign bodies containing copper are notorious for their destructive effect on the eye. The reason that they are non-magnetic generally makes them more difficult to remove as compared to iron or steel foreign bodies.","Symptoms vary according to the size, location and content of copper in intraocular foreign body.
There may be no reaction, if the copper content is less than 70%. The most intense reactions are associated with copper content more than 85%. Larger foreign bodies offer more surface area from which to liberate copper ion. A foreign body in mid- vitreous may not incite inflammation or it may be quietly encapsulated. Locations near vascularised retina and ciliary body are more prone to incite inflammation.
Acute Chalcosis presents rapidly with

Inflammation
Deteriorating vision
Hypotony
Retinal detachment.

Chronic Chalcosis may present with

Low-grade intraocular inflammation
Variable or no changes in visual function
Gradual diminution of vision.","Copper containing foreign bodies are the most common non-magnetic foreign bodies.
Copper diffuses within the eye in its ionised form. Foreign bodies containing more than 85% copper typically form diffuse deposits, whereas foreign bodies with lower copper content usually causes more localised response. Copper has affinity for intraocular basement membranes e.g. Descemet’s membrane and Lens capsule.
Causes of Chalcosis includes

Penetrating ocular injuries
Wilson’s disease (hepato-lenticular degeneration)","Diagnosis is based on clinical features such as

Sclera: May show softening or abscess formation
Cornea: There may be Kayser- Fleischer ring (usually superior and/or inferior). It may be circumferential as well.
Anterior chamber: There may be cells and reactions. Copper- coloured metallic particles may be present.
Iris: It may show greenish tinge.
Lens: Sunflower cataract (chalcosis lentis) in anterior and posterior central lens capsule as a green- grey, almost metallic, disciform opacity, often with serrated edges and lateral radiations. There may be yellow or copper tinge.
Vitreous: Greenish or reddish- brown deposits with degeneration.
Retina: Granular deposits, retinal detachment or degeneration.
Optic nerve: Papillitis.

There may be diminution of vision, visual field defects, abnormal electroretinogram, or ocular hypotension.

Histology
Histologically, no stain specific for copper exists. However, copper itself functions as a vital stain and shows as tiny opaque (black) dot in unstained sections.

Laboratory tests

Visual field. 
Electroretinogram. 
Dark adaptometry, if required.
B- scan ultrasonography to define status of vitreous and retina.
Computed tomography to localise a foreign body.
Radiographic spectrometry to check for the presence of intraocular copper ions.","Management involves
Systemic therapy
Prophylaxis for endophthalmitis should be given.
Oral steroids suppress inflammatory response.
Initial local therapy
Initial therapy involves closure of an open Eyeball due to injury.
Surgical therapy
Foreign bodies with copper content of 85% or more may incite acute inflammatory response. It requires prompt removal of foreign body.
Vitrectomy with or without lensectomy and scleral buckle may be done.
Peribulbar dexamethasone suppresses both inflammation and encapsulation of intraocular copper."
Commotio Retinae,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/commotio-retinae,"Commotio Retinae orBerlin’s Oedema is grey-white discolouration of the retina due to disruption of outer segment photoreceptor layer following blunt trauma. This is caused due to contrecoup injury. Shock waves caused due to impact traverses the fluid- filled eye and then strike retina.
Commotio retinae or Berlin’s oedema was first described by a German physician, Rudolph Berlin in the year 1873, as a transient grey-white opacification of the macular/ peripheral retina following blunt trauma to eye.
Commotio retinae may involve any part of retina and may be accompanied by choroidal rupture or retinal haemorrhage. Macular oedema reduces central vision, but vision usually improves as the oedema resolves. After an acute attack of oedema, there may be scarring of retina with pigment dispersal. Vision may be acutely reduced or normal depending upon whether the macula is involved or not. It may permanently reduce vision if the fovea centralis is involved.","Symptoms
Symptoms of Commotio retinae may be

Acute diminution of vision
Permanent diminution of vision","Commotio retinae is caused due to pressure waves emanating from blunt trauma to the eye resulting in retinal injury. There may also be associated choroidal rupture or retinal haemorrhage. Following acute episode of oedema, retina may develop scarring and pigment dispersal. Macular commotio retinae reduces central vision. The vision usually improves on resolution of oedema, unless there is development of macular hole or disruption of retinal pigment epithelium of the fovea.
Studies suggest that commotio retinae is probably caused due to disruption of the photoreceptor outer segments, and is not a true extracellular oedema.
This is more common in young males.","Diagnosis depends upon the history of injury to the eye and clinical features.
There are two variations of commotio retinae depending upon the severity of injury to the eye.

Retinal concussion: Retinal concussion is a mild injury with less dramatic grey-white retinal changes and is less frequently associated with retinal haemorrhage. The retina usually recovers spontaneously without leading to permanent loss of vision.
Retinal contusion: Retinal contusion is produced due to more severe trauma to the eye. It causes more dramatic retinal whitening and haemorrhage. It may lead to permanent loss of vision, especially with involvement of macula.

Clinical features on examination may include:

Retinal whitening in macular area or retinal periphery
‘Cherry red’ spot at the macula
Retinal haemorrhage
Choroidal haemorrhage
Chronic alterations in foveal retinal pigment epithelium
Macular hole
Retinal dialysis
Avulsion of vitreous base
Vitreous haemorrhage

Commotio retinae is a self-limiting opacification of retina following direct ocular trauma, and is characterised by transient whitening at the level of deep sensory retina. Retinal whitening may take hours to develop before it may be seen with the help of ophthalmoscope. The lesion may affect both central or peripheral retina.

Investigations

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) suggests and confirms that the major site of retinal trauma appears to be at the level of photoreceptor outer segment and retinal pigment epithelium interface.
Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA): Fundus Fluorescein Angiography may show early blockage in areas of white retina and no alteration in vascular permeability.There may be leakage of fluorescein dye with associated retinal pigment epithelium changes. A ‘salt and pepper’ fundus may be seen in cases with more severe injury.


Histopathology
Histopathologically, animal models have suggested that there is disruption of photoreceptor outer segments with associated damage to retinal pigment epithelium.
Histologic studies do not separate cases into retinal concussion or contusion.

Differential diagnosis
Differential diagnosis includes

Traumatic macular hole
Choroidal rupture
Retinal artery occlusion
Retinal detachment
Purtscher retinopathy","There is no approved medical therapy for commotio retinae. The patient should be observed closely during first few days to weeks following trauma, to monitor development of any complication and its treatment thereof.
The cases which do not resolve spontaneously may be tried with intravenous steroids. This may reduce retinal swelling and thus may help in improvement of vision.

Prognosis
Most patients recover spontaneously, but some with more severe trauma may remain visually impaired with reduced vision or paracentral scotoma.
Most of the cases resolve within four weeks of injury, although some improvement may continue for up to even six weeks. Some patients have permanent macular damage with absolute or relative scotoma. Patients with involvement of macular area have poor prognosis."
Cavities,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/cavities,"Cavities commonly called as “Tooth decay” is damage to the outer protective layer of the tooth i.e. enamel.
It is the most prevalent chronic disease in both children and adults. Tooth Decay (Dental caries) happens when bacteria in mouth make acid that attacks the enamel. It can lead to cavities, which are holes in the teeth. If it is not treated well in time, it can cause pain, infection, and even tooth loss.
In most developing low-income countries, the prevalence rate of dental caries is high and more than 90% of caries is untreated. An estimated 5 billion people worldwide suffer from dental caries.
HOW DO CAVITIES OCCUR?
Tooth surfaces are rough, uneven and a favourite place for cavity-causing bacteria to hide andwhere leftover food also gets accumulated. These bacteria combine with food and constantly form a soft, sticky film called plaque. When we eat or drink foods containing sugars, the bacteria in plaque produce acid that attacks the tooth enamel. Due to stickiness of the plaque this acid remains in contact with our teeth and over time damages tooth enamel and causes cavities.
The development of caries requires sugars and bacteria to be present. It is influenced by the susceptibility of the tooth, the bacterial profile, quantity and quality of the saliva, low levels of fluoride, and the time for which dietary carbohydrates are available in the oral cavity for bacterial fermentation (i.e. the frequency of sugar intake).
Salvia and fluorides, helps the enamel to repair itself by replacing the minerals. Teeth go through this natural process of losing minerals and regaining minerals all day long. But if we don't take care of our teeth and/or eat and drink lot of sugary things, enamel will keep losing minerals leading to tooth decay.","In the beginning, there may not be any symptom at all. As the decay extends, it may cause signs and symptoms:

White or brown spots on tooth appear where minerals have been lost as an early sign of tooth decay.
Sensitivity to hot, cold or even sweet foods
Difficulty in chewing food
Toothache
Visible holes or pits in teeth
Food trapping in between teeth
It can also harm the nerves in the teeth and the roots.","Main causes and risk factors for tooth decay are:
1. Not taking care of your teeth like-

not brushing twice daily
not rinsing mouth after meals
having too much sugary or starchy foods and drinks.

2. People at higher risk of tooth decay are those who:

drink from bottles (babies and toddlers), especially if they are given feeders with sugar mixed milk or juices at bedtime. This exposes their teeth to sugars for long periods of time. Their gum pads should be cleaned with a neat cotton cloth after feeding.
Don't get enough fluorides.
Have reduced saliva because of some drugs, certain diseases, or some cancer treatment.

3. Back teeth (molars and premolars) have uneven surface that can trap food particles and are more prone to decay.
4. Sticky foods such as toffees, chocolates, ice cream, honey, sugar, soda, dried fruit, cake, cookies, hard candy and mints, dry cereal, and chips increase chances of tooth decay.
5. Frequent snacking and sipping sugary drinks provide mouth bacteria more carbohydrates to produce acid that attacks teeth and causes decay.",No Diagnosis.,No Management.
Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/cleft-lip-and-cleft-palate,"INTRODUCTION
Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate are common congenital malformations (birth defects), also known as oral clefts or orofacial clefts. Birth defects are health conditions that are present at birth and they change the shape or function of one or more body parts. During the development of lip and palate in early pregnancy period, incomplete fusion of upper lip and palate leads to the formation of cleft lip and palate in a child.
A child can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate or both because development of lips and palate occur at different times during gestation. Children with these birth defects have difficulty in feeding and talking. They are also prone to ear infections, hearing loss, and dental problems.
Cleft lip and cleft palate are common birth defects and happen very early in the pregnancy. Asian population have highest frequency, often 1 in 500 or higher. Cleft lip with or without cleft palate is more common in males than in females. Isolated cleft palate is more common in females whereas males have more severe defects.
Cleft lip is an opening in the upper lip due to incomplete formation of the upper lip before birth. It may be unilateral or bilateral (on both sides of lip).
Cleft palate is an opening of the hard palate or soft palate (roof of the mouth) due to its incomplete fusion. It may also be unilateral or bilateral.

Cleft lip and Cleft palate can be easily identified at birth as these may appear as:

An opening in the upper lip and roof of the mouth (palate) that may be unilateral or bilateral.
Only a small notch in the upper lip or extended from the upper lip through palate into the bottom of the nose.
An opening in the palate (roof of the mouth) that doesn't affect facial appearance.


Children with the cleft lip and palate deformities face several problems such as:

Difficulty in feeding: new born child is not able to breast feed properly due to child’s inability to suck efficiently. Nipples for bottle feeding present the same problem.
Difficulty in swallowing, as liquids or foods come out the nose.
Nasal speaking voice and various speech problems.
These children are more prone to chronic ear infections and fluid accumulation in the middle ear.
May have malformed and missing teeth.


Certain otherbirth defectsthat may be associated with cleft lip and palate are - Common cardiac defects, Pyloric stenosis (narrowing of stomach as it connects to the small intestine), Club foot, and Scoliosis.

Definite aetiology of cleft lip and palate is still unknown but heredity is the most important factor. Environmental factors also play an important role.

Heredity: If there is a family history of cleft lip and cleft palate there are more chances of a baby having these birth defects.
Smokingordrinking alcoholduring pregnancy increases the risk of having a baby with cleft lip and palate.
Nutritional disturbances may also have a role in causing these birth defects.
Strean and Peer reported that physiologic, emotional, or traumatic stress may play an important role in development of human clefts. 
Epilepsy and anti-seizure medicines during the first trimester of pregnancy, may cause cleft lip (with or without cleft palate) or isolated cleft palate.


Other possible causes of CLP are:

Defective blood supply to the area involved
Infections
Alcohol, certain drugs, and toxins
Lack of inherent developmental forces

Most of the children are diagnosed with cleft lip or cleft palate after birth. The diagnosis of cleft lip at birth is obvious whereas to rule out cleft palate, direct illuminated examination of the infant's hard and soft palate is done. Palpation of hard and soft palate is also done to ensure that a partial cleft is not missed. Prenatal ultrasound may demonstrate deformities like cleft lip and palate.

Diarrhea,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/intestines/diarrhoea,"As per WHO, Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual). Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhoea, nor is the passing of loose, ""pasty"" stools by breastfed babies.
It is usually the symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by a variety of viral, parasitic and bacteria organisms.As per UNICEF report, diarrhoeal diseases account for nearly 1.3 million deaths a year among children under-five years of age making them the second most common cause of child deaths worldwide. Over half of the deaths occur in just five countries: India, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Ethiopia. It is both preventable and treatable. Severe diarrhoea leads to fluid loss and may be life-threatening particularly in young children and people who are malnourished or have impaired immunity. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene. Diarrhoea caused by contaminated food or water while travelling is often known as traveller’s diarrhoea.","Diarrhea is associated with symptoms depending on the cause and who is affected.
Symptoms include:

Watery stools
Abdominal cramps
Thin or loose stools
Sense of urgency to have a bowel movement
Nausea and vomiting

In addition to the symptoms described above, the symptoms of complicated diarrhoea include:

Persitent diarrhoea can lead to dehydration
Blood, mucus, or undigested food in the stool
Weight loss
Fever","Diarrhoea usually occurs when fluid cannot be absorbed from the contents of bowel or when extra fluid is secreted into bowel causing watery faeces.
Short-term diarrhoea : Diarrhoea is usually a symptom of gastroenteritis (a bowel infection). It can be caused by:

A virus, such as a Norovirus or Rotavirus
A Parasite , such as the Giardia intestinalis, that causes Giardiasis
Bacteria, such as Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella and Shigella: they all may cause food poisoning

Other causes of short-term diarrhoea include:

Emotional upset or anxiety
Intake of too much coffee or alcohol
Any food allergy
Appendicitis (painful swelling of the appendix)
Damage to the lining of the intestines due to radiotherapy.

Diarrhoea can also sometimes be a side effect of medicineslike :

Antibiotics
Antacid medicines that contain magnesium
Some medicines that are used in chemotherapy
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs)
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
Statins - cholesterol-lowering medicines
Laxatives - medicine used to help empty bowels, if constipated

Long-term diarrhoea

Bowel cancer - which can cause diarrhoea and blood in stools
Chronic pancreatitis - inflammation of the pancreas, a small organ that produces hormones and digestive juices
Coeliac disease - a gastrointestinal tract disorder where one is intolerant to the protein gluten
Crohn's disease - a condition that causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - a poorly understood condition where the normal functions of the bowel are disrupted
Microscopic colitis - a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes watery diarrhoea
Ulcerative colitis - a condition that affects the colon (large intestine)
Cystic fibrosis - an inherited condition that affects the lungs and digestive system
Persistent diarrhea can also sometimes occur following a gastrectomy. This is a surgical operation to remove part of the stomach - for example, as a treatment for stomach cancer.

Diarrhea can also sometimes be caused by bariatric surgery (weight loss surgery that is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese).","The following diarrhoeal conditions should be further investigated:

In infants
Moderate or severe diarrhoea in young children
Associated with blood
Associated non-cramping abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, etc.
In travellers
In food handlers, because of the potential to infect others;
In institutions such as hospitals, child care centers, or geriatric and convalescent homes.

Stool sample: To know the cause of the infection
Blood test: Blood test is generally done to test the signs of inflammation which may suggest disease like inflammatory bowel disease If the cause of diarrhoea is still not clear, then patient may be advised for further investigations. Like:

Sigmoidoscopy-Where an instrument called a Sigmoidoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light on one end) is inserted into rectum and up into sigmoid colon, S-shaped last part of the colon.
Colonoscopy - A similar procedure that uses a larger tube, called a colonoscope, to examine large intestine called colon.","Drink fluids : It is important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) : ORS should be used to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yoghurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given.
Medications: Antibiotics are beneficial in certain types of acute diarrhoea, they are usually not used except in specific situations. Over the counter drug Pepto-Bismol ( Bismuth subsalicylate ) , or anti-motility drug Imodium plus ( Loperamide hydrochloride with simethicone ) are few of medicines for diarrhoea.
Eating : WHO recommends a child with diarrhoea should continue to be fed. Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. In contrast, children whose food is restricted, have diarrhoea of longer duration and recovery of intestinal function is slow."
Deafness,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/deafness,"As per WHO, ‘A person who is not able to hear as well as someone with normal hearing – hearing thresholds of 25 decibel(a unit to measure intensity of sound) or better in both ears – is said to have hearing loss’. Hearing impaired people can be hard of hearing (HOH) or deaf. ‘Hard of hearing’ refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. They usually communicate through spoken language. If a person cannot hear at all, then they have deafness. They are unable to hear and understand even a shouted voice.  

Hearing impairment may be inherited, or caused by diseases like maternal rubella or complications at birth, certain infectious diseases such as meningitis,use of ototoxic drugs(drugs toxic to ears), exposure to excessive noise and ageing.

Impact of hearing loss
Functional impact
One of the main impact of hearing loss is on an individual’s inability to converse with others. Children with hearing loss often suffer in spoken language development .
Hearing loss and ear diseases such asotitis mediacan have a significant adverse effect on the educational of children. However, If people suffering from hearing loss are provided a chance to communicate they can participate on an equal footing with others.
The communication can be through spoken/ written language or through sign language.
Restricted access to communicate can have a significant impact on everyday life, causing feelings of solitude, seclusion and dissatisfaction, particularly among older people with hearing loss.

Economic impact
In developing countries, children with impaired hearing or deafness rarely receive any schooling. Adults with hearing loss are also subjected to higher unemployment rate. Among those who are employed, a higher percentage of people with hearing loss are in the lower grades of employment compared with the general workforce.
National Programme for Prevention and Control of Deafness

Management of Common Ear Conditions","Early signs and symptoms of hearing loss may include:
In Adults

Trouble in hearing other people clearly
Requesting people to say again
Listening to music or watching television with the high volume
Not being able to hear telephone or door bell

In Children

Child is slow in learning, how to talk, or is not clear while speaking
Child asks you to repeat again
Child talks very loudly
Child watches TV at high volume

All these signs may point towards hearing impairment and should be discussed with a physician without delay.","The causes of hearing loss and deafness can be either congenital or acquired
Congenital causes
Congenital causes leading to hearing loss include:

Infections like maternal rubella, syphilis or certain other infections during pregnancy;
Low birth weight
Birth asphyxia (lack of oxygen at the time of birth);
Inappropriate use of ototoxic drugs (such as aminoglycosides, cytotoxic drugs, antimalarial drugs and diuretics) during pregnancy
Severe jaundice in the neonatal period, can damage nerve for hearing in a newborn infant, leading to defness.

Acquired causes
Acquired causes lead to hearing loss at any age.

Infectious diseases such as meningitis, measles and mumps can lead to loss of hearing especially in childhood but can also occur in later life.
Chronic ear infection, which commonly presents as discharging ears, can lead to hearing loss. In certain cases this condition can also lead to serious, life-threatening complications, such as brain abscess or meningitis.
Collection of fluid in the ear (otitis media with effusion) can cause hearing loss.
Use of ototoxic drugs at any age, such as antibiotic like Gentamicin or antimalarial medicines, can damage inner ear.
Head injury or injury to the ear can cause hearing loss.
Working in excessive noise or loud music or other loud noises, such as gunfire or explosions, can affect hearing.
Age-related hearing loss (presbyacusis) is caused by degeneration of sensory cells.
Wax or foreign bodies blocking the ear canal can cause hearing loss at any age","One should visit doctor as soon as they have hearing problem. The doctor may examine your ear with an instrument called auriscope to look for anything abnormal.
*NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. As the disease progress may vary from person to person so consult your physician for actual diagnosis &amp; treatment.","Treatment depends upon the cause of the condition like:

Hearing impairment due to blockage of ear can be treated by drops or suction.
Bacterial infection can be treated by antibiotics
However, hearing loss cause by damage to inner ear or to the nerves is permanent.

Hearing aids doesn't treat the disease but helps in hearing.
It is not suitable for everyone and should be used with the advice of your physician.
*NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. As the disease progress may vary from person to person so consult your physician for actual diagnosis &amp; treatment."
Dementia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/dementia,"Dementia is an illness of old age, usually characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive functions from the previous level. Loss of memory for the recent events is a classical feature. A number of cognitive functions including new learning, intelligence, decision making, executive functioning and language are affected, besides the memory. In the later stages, the patient may not even be able to take care of self, and the illness affects the basic personal and social skills.
Advances in the medical field have been associated with increase in life expectancy leading to increasing number of old age population. As per the 2011 census, India is home to about 65 million people of age 65 and above, constituting 5.5% of the total population. Prevalence of dementia in India is reported to be 2.7%. As the age increase, prevalence of dementia increases. For example, nearly 20% of people above 80 suffer from dementia. Mean age of presentation is relatively younger at 66.3 years in India, about 10 years lesser than in the developed countries.
Unlike the West, in India most of the elderly people live with their families and most patients with dementia are taken care of by the families. With the increasing elderly population and reducing joint family system in our country, dementia poses a great challenge.","One of the earliest symptoms of dementia is impairment of memory for recent events. Onset is usually slow and gradual, though it is sudden in vascular dementia. There is a progressive deterioration of various intellectual abilities. Often the family members observe that the patient starts forgetting about his daily use belongings, such as purse, pen or shoes and about recent events and whom he met the day before. He forgets about conversations, events of the day, telephone numbers, etc. A distinguishing feature is that the person himself is often not aware of this development. Interestingly, memory for remote events even going back to his early life is preserved.
In later stages, he may even forget names of close relatives, their occupations and places of stay. The patient may even have difficulty recalling the names of grandchildren. The progressive memory impairment may lead to faulty orientation to time and place. Symptoms often worsen at night. Ability to learn new tasks and skills gets impaired. In later stages, judgment also gets affected.
In the early phases, the patient may feel anxious and concerned over the memory disturbance, and may also feel depressed. But as the disturbance increases, the person does not accept memory loss. Sometimes it may progress on to suspiciousness. The patient may become impulsive and socially disinhibited. He may cut coarse jokes without caring for the consequences. In later stages, the patient may be unable to take care of his personal needs, may become sleepless and restless. He may get lost in surroundings familiar to him. In later stages, person may not even be able to take care of basic personal needs and need supervised care.
Focal neurological deficits like fits, weakness of limbs or body, aphasia or dysarthria and failing vision may appear in later stages of dementia.
Behavioural and psychological symptoms like apathy, depression, irritability, agitation/aggression are also common in subjects with dementia. Some patients may also develop paranoid symptoms and disorganized behaviour in later stages of illness.
Thus dementia often starts off with just memory problems, but later involves:

Difficulty communicating (recognizing, identifying, naming, finding words to explain)
Difficulty planning and carrying out day-to-day tasks (using household appliances like microwave or washing machine, leaving the gas stove on after cooking, etc)
Ability to learn, reason, retain or recall past experience
Changes in mood, personality and judgement

Dementia is differentiated from delirium, which is an acute illness characterized by altered sensorium or decreased level of consciousness, disorientation for time and place, fluctuating course with worsening in evening. Perceptual disturbances like illusions and hallucinations are characteristic features of delirium. Delirium is a medical emergency and is usually short lasting unlike dementia.","Dementia is a result of degenerative changes in the brain. The most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. One study from India analyzing types of dementia found Alzheimer’s disease in 38.3%, vascular dementia in 25.4%, fronto-temporal dementia in 18.7%, diffuse Lewy body disease in 8.9%, and mixed dementia in 8.6% of the patients. In dementia, the brain cells tend to degenerate and die more rapidly than the normal ageing process.
Some of the important characteristics of these different types of dementia are discussed as below:
Alzheimer’s disease: Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, contributing to about 40% cases of dementia in India. Loss of memory for recent events is initial manifestation, worsening slowly over time and involving other cognitive functions. Though there is difficulty in remembering the events that have happened recently, the patient is able to recall the events of remote past. The patient has also difficulty in recalling particular words and naming objects.
Family members would give history of the patient having:

Difficulty in learning new things.
Difficulty remembering appointments or phone messages.
Inability to remember the names of people or places and difficulty communicating with others.
Forgetting where they have put things of daily use like watch, purse, etc. The patient may also worry that someone has taken away.
Denial of the memory problem, The person may attempt to cover up the deficit.

Cause lies in degenerative changes in the brain. The damaged tissue in brain builds up to form deposits called 'plaques' and 'tangles'. These cause brain cells around them to die.
Vascular dementia: Vascular dementia, also called multi infarct dementia, is the second commonest cause of dementia. Compared to the West, it is more common in India. It is usually caused by blockage in the blood vessels supplying the brain, leading to ischemia or infarct. MRI of brain would reveal multiple infarcts. Sometime vascular dementia develops after an attack of stroke. Memory disturbances come in form of step ladder pattern, increasing with a fresh infarct. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes or high cholesterol.
Some of the important characteristics of vascular dementia are:

Memory loss and difficulty concentrating.
Language problems like aphasia
Mood swings, depression
Episodes of confusion, aggressive behaviour, hallucinations
Physical deficits like paralysis or weakness of limbs

Both vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can also co-exist.
Lewy body dementia: Lewy body dementia is a relatively less common type of dementia, compared to the Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. It is characterized by development of protein deposits (Lewy bodies) building up in the brain. Some of the symptoms overlap with Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
Characteristic features of Lewy body dementia are

Fluctuating level of attention and alertness
Vivid visual hallucinations (seeing human or animal figures)
Trembling of hands, muscle stiffness, falls or difficulty with walking.

Fronto-temporal dementia: In fronto- temporal dementia, the front part of the brain consisting of frontal and temporal lobes is predominantly involved. It is slightly more common than Lewy body dementia. It is seen in relatively younger people compared to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, usually starting in 50s and 60s. Personality deterioration, social disinhibition, and behavioural disorganization are common. A person, who was usually very polite and proper, might become irritable or rude. Memory may remain reasonably intact for a long time.","Any patient developing memory disturbance or personality deterioration in the age group above 50, occurring over a period of few months needs to consult the physician, psychiatrist or neurologist. The person needs to be examined in detail to rule out dementia. Mini Mental Sate Examination (MMSE) or its Hindi adaptation called Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE) are commonly used to screen for dementia. Both can be administered in a clinic setting and take about 10 minutes.
Detailed physical and neurological examination is conducted. The person needs to be investigated for basic haematology, liver function, kidney function, thyroid, nutritional deficiencies especially vitamin B12 and folate. Sometimes, nutritional deficiencies or hypothyroidism may be responsible for the dementing changes. Once corrected, the memory disturbance improves. Similarly chronic alcohol use can also lead to dementia.
A CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) are also performed to detect the degenerative changes. Diagnosis of dementia is, however, mainly clinical.","Dementia, being a degenerative illness, is mostly untreatable. Investigations are generally performed to find out a treatable cause, which if identified (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiency ), can be corrected. Certain measures like good nutrition, regular exercise and adequate sleep can improve the quality of life of the patient, and also help in slowing the progression of disease. Simplifying activities or modifying expectations to the cognitive and skill level of the patient can eliminate frustration. The home environment may need to be modified (lighting, positioning of bed, toilets, etc) to compensate for the patient's deficits.
The family members caring for the patient with dementia also face tremendous stress and burden in the care giving role and also need psychological support, guidance and help. They need to be educated about the problem and guided how to deal with it. Family therapy, group therapy and counselling are used to help them. Some of the NGOs like HelpAge India also run self help groups.
Certain medications like donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine (also called cholinesterase inhibitors) are useful in early stages of the Alzheimer’s disease, and slow down the progress of dementia. These increase the acetylcholine levels in the brain. Memantine is another drug which improves symptoms.
In vascular dementia, blood pressure needs to be kept under control and anticoagulant therapy is used to reduce the risk of further infarction."
Dengue Fever,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/musculo-skeletal-bone-joints-/dengue-fever,"Dengue is a viral disease, transmitted by the infective bite of a particular mosquito known as Aedes Aegypti. Human being develops disease after 5 – 6 days of being bitten by an infective mosquito. It occurs in two forms: Classical Dengue fever also known as “break bone” fever and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which is life threatening. It is very common after rainy season. It is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another through mosquito bites. It is widespread in tropical and sub-tropical regions.
It is a very common disease in India since last two decades. Dengue can affect everybody, irrespective of their age and gender. However, deaths are common amongst children during DHF outbreak.

The disease is endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The America, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected.
In the year 2015, According to National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) maximum numbers of cases were reported from Delhi followed by Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, Gujarat , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Telangana and other states.

FAQs","Symptoms usually develop within 3-14 days after being exposed to the dengue virus (also known as incubation period). The average incubation period is around 4-7 days.
Symptoms of dengue are:

Sudden-onset fever
Headache (typically located behind the eyes)
Muscle and joint pain
Rash
Chills (shivering)
Facial flushing
Loss of appetite
Sore throat
Abnormal bleeding such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums and/or blood in your urine.","Dengue virus is an RNA virus. Transmission of this virus occurs in a cycle. An infected human is bitten by a female mosquito. The infected mosquito then bites another human, and the cycle continues.
MOSQUITO
Aedes aegyptimosquitoes most commonly bite at dusk and dawn, indoors, in shady areas, or when the weather is cloudy. They can bite and spread infection at any time of day and all year long.
The mosquitoes prefer to breed in areas ofstagnant water, such as flower vases, uncovered barrels, buckets, water coolers and discarded tires. Some of the dangerous areas are wet floors and toilet tanks, as they allow the mosquitoes to breed in the residence.
Although the lifespan of an adultA. aegyptiis two to four weeks depending on conditions, the eggs can be viable for over a year in dry state. This allows the mosquito to reappear after a cold winter or dry spell.
There are four serotypes of the virus that cause dengue (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4)
Some facts about Ades mosquito-

Ae. aegyptiis closely associated with human environments and can breed in indoor (flower vases, concrete water tanks in bathrooms), and artificial outdoor (vehicle tyres, water storage vessels, discarded containers) environments.
The eggs can survive up to 1 year without water. Once water is available (even small quantities of standing water), the eggs develop into larvae and then adult mosquitoes.
Aedesmosquitoes are active during daylight hours, and usually bite during the morning and late afternoon/evening hours.
FemaleAedesmosquito acquires the virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person.
FemaleAedesmosquito usually flies anaverage of 400 metres. But it may be transported accidently by humans from one place to another (e.g. in the back of the car, plants).","A probable diagnosis is based on occurrence of fever along with some of the following symptoms.

Nausea and vomiting
Rash
Generalized pain

The diagnosis also takes into account whether the suspected person lives in endemic (high prevalence) area.
Blood test-

Microscopic examination: This is done in order to detect dengue. The earliest change detectable is a low white blood cell count which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis.
Haematocrit -Haemoconcentration, as estimated by an increase in haematocrit of 20% or more compared with convalescent values, is suggestive of hypovolaemia due to vascular permeability and plasma leakage.

Virus isolation - Cell culture is the most widely used method for dengue virus isolation
Nucleic acid detection- Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays offer better sensitivity compared to virus isolation. Dengue virus (Nucleic acid) can be detected in the blood about first 5 days after onset of symptoms.
Detection of antigen-NS1 antigen test (non-structural protein 1) -Dengue NS1 antigen test is useful in the diagnosis of dengue fever in the first week of the illness.
Serological tests-

MAC-ELISA -IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC- ELISA) can be used for detection of IgM antibody five days or more after the onset of fever. According to WHO ELISAs performed better than rapid tests.
IgG ELISA- the IgG ELISA is used for the detection of recent (if paired sera are collected within the correct time interval) or past dengue infections. A fourfold or greater increase in IgG antibodies in acute and convalescent paired sera can be used to detect recent infections. These tests are not in wide use.

PRNT-Plaque Reduction and Neutralization Test (PRNT) and the microneutralization PRNT can be used to detect specific serotype of dengue virus.
Rapid diagnostic test:It is a method for specifically detecting anti-dengue IgG and IgM antibodies. The test can detect all four serotypes of dengue.","There is no specific medication for treatment of a dengue infection. Persons suspected of dengue can use analgesics (pain relievers) and avoid those containing aspirin. They should take plenty of fluids, rest and consult a physician at the earliest possible. If condition does not improve after 3-5 days, then one should seek further medical advice."
Diabetes Mellitus,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/pancreas/diabetes-mellitus,"Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar) level either due to inadequate insulin production or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin or both. The term ""Diabetes Mellitus"" describes a metabolic disorder of multiple etiology characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat (dyslipidaemia) and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The main symptoms are: -

Polyuria (frequent urination)
Polydipsia (increased thirst)
Polyphagia (increased hunger


The main types of diabetes are:
Type 1 diabetes: It is due to the body's malfunction to produce insulin in the body, and requires the person to inject insulin. This form was previously referred to as ""Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus"" (IDDM) or ""Juvenile Diabetes"".
Type 2 diabetes: It is due to insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency. This form was previously referred to as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or ""adult-onset diabetes"".
Type 2 diabetes can be prevented after following healthy life style such as healthy diet, proper exercise or maintaining healthy weight.
The third main form, Gestational diabetes occurs when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes develop a high blood glucose level. It may lead to type 2 DM.
Other types of diabetes include those caused by:

Diseases of the pancreas or conditions that damage the pancreas, such as pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis
Excess amounts of certain hormones resulting from some medical conditions such as cortisol in Cushing’s syndrome that work against the action of insulin 
Medications that reduce insulin action, such as glucocorticoids, or chemicals that destroy beta cells","The main symptoms of diabetes are:

Polyuria: urinating frequently (particularly at night)
Polydipsia: feeling very thirsty
Polyphagia: feeling hungry frequently
Weakness
Weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
Frequent episodes of thrush
Cuts or wounds that heal slowly
Blurred vision


Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly, over weeks or even days. Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realizing because early symptoms tend to be common.","Type 1 Diabetes:The immune system of body attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As no insulin is produced, glucose levels further increase, which can seriously damage the body's organs. Type 1 diabetes is often known as insulin-dependent diabetes.It is also sometimes known as juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes because it usually develops before the age of 40, often during the teenage years. Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 Diabetes:Type 2 diabetes is where the body does not produce enough insulin or the body's cells do not respond to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes, and is far more common than type 1 diabetes.
Risk factors for type 2 diabetes:

Obesity or being overweight
Impaired glucose tolerance
High blood pressure
Dyslipidemia - Low levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (""good"") cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, high low-density lipoproteins (LDL)
Gestational diabetes
Sedentary lifestyle
Family history
Age

Gestational Diabetes:Some women tend to experience high levels of blood glucose as during pregnancy due to reduced sensitivity of insulin receptors.","The clinical diagnosis of diabetics is often prompted by symptoms such as increased thirst and urination and recurrent infections.
Blood Tests - Fasting plasma glucose, two-hour postprandial test and oral glucose tolerance test are done to know blood glucose levels.

Down's Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/down-s-syndrome,"Down syndrome (DS) or Down's syndrome is also known as trisomy 21. It is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of extra chromosome 21 .It is typically associated with a delay in cognitive ability (mental retardation or MR) and physical growth and a particular set of facial characteristics.
The average IQ of young adults with Down syndrome is around 50 whereas young adults without the condition typically have an IQ of 100.","People with Down syndrome share a number of physical characteristics. Not everyone suffering from the syndrome will have all of them but they may include:

Decreased muscle tone resulting in floppiness (hypotonia)
Small nose and flat nasal bridge
Small head, ears and mouth
Eyes slant upwards and outwards
Groove between the first and second toe (sandal gap)
Broad hands with short fingers
Palm may have only one crease (palmar crease)
Below average weight and length at birth","Down syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs as a result of an extra chromosome (chromosome 21). Usually, cells contain 46 chromosomes. 23 are inherited from the mother and 23 from the father. People with Down syndrome, may contain 47 chromosomes as there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. The additional genetic material causes physical and developmental characteristics associated with Down syndrome. There are three forms of Down syndrome, although the effects of each type are usually similar.

Trisomy 21 is the most common type. Trisomy 21 is generally seen due to every cell in the body has an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy is a Greek word that means ‘third copy’).
Translocation is caused when a piece of chromosome 21 attaches itself to another chromosome in a cell.
Mosaicism is the least common type. Here, only some of the cells have an extra copy of chromosome 21. People with mosaic Down syndrome may experience less delay with some aspects of their development.","Antenatal/ Pre natal screening: Pregnant women of any age should be offered screening for genetic conditions such as Down syndrome. Antenatal screening is a way of assessing the likelihood of baby developing or already having developed an abnormality during pregnancy. The screening test used for Down syndrome is known as the ‘combined test’. It includes a blood test and ultrasound scan.
A sample of blood is taken and tested to check the levels of certain proteins and hormones. If blood contains abnormal levels of these substances then there may be an increased chance of having a baby with Down syndrome.
A special type of ultrasound scanknown as nuchal translucency that measures the pocket of fluid behind the baby’s neck. Babies with Down syndrome usually have more fluid in their neck than normal. Measuring the thickness of fluid will help determine whether baby is likely to have Down syndrome.
Post natal diagnosis: Clinical examination by a paediatrician can often confirm or refute this suspicion with confidence. Systems of diagnostic criteria for such an examination include Fried's diagnostic index which includes the following 8 signs:

Flat face
Ear dysplasia
Tongue protrusion
Corners of mouth turned down
Hypotonia
Neck skin excess
Epicanthic fold
A gap between 1st and 2nd toes.

With 0 to 2 of these characteristics, the newborn can likely be said to not have Down syndrome (with less than one in 100 false negatives), with 3 to 5 of these characteristics, the situation is unclear (and genetic testing is recommended) and with 6 to 8 characteristics, the newborn can confidently be said to have Down syndrome (with less than one in 100.000 false positives).
*NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis/ treatment purpose please consult your physician.","There is no cure for the down's syndrome yet but there is much that can be done to help someone with the condition to lead a healthy, active and more independent life. Management strategies such as:
Early childhood intervention: Early intervention is a system of coordinated services that promotes the child's growth and development and supports families during the critical early years like Early communication intervention promote linguistic skills.

Screening for common problems.
Medical treatment when required
A conducive family environment
Vocational training that can improve the overall development of children with Down syndrome.
Education and proper care will improve quality of life significantly

Plastic surgery: Plastic surgery has sometimes proved to promote and performed on children with Down syndrome based on the assumption that surgery can reduce the facial features associated with Down syndrome, therefore, decreasing social stigma and leading to a better quality of life.
Cognitive development: Individuals with Down syndrome differ considerably in their language and communication skills. It is routine to screen for middle ear problems and hearing loss, low gain hearing aids or other amplification devices can be useful for language learning.
Music therapy is useful in some patients for social and motor development.

Dacryoadenitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/dacryoadenitis,"Dacryoadenitis is an inflammation of the lacrimal gland. Dacryoadenitis may be acute or chronic.
Lacrimal gland is located in the superotemporal part of the orbit. It consists of two parts, palpebral lobe, which is visible on eversion of the eyelid and orbital lobe. Secretions of gland form the aqueous layer of the tear film. Dacryoadenitis may be infectious or has systemic aetiology.
Lacrimal gland belongs to the lymphoid tissue system and is called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). It contains Immunogobulin A (IgA) plasma cells, T cell lymphocytes and few B cell lymphocytes.
Dacryoadenitis often lacks the inflammatory signs and may present with enlargement only, then it has to be distinguished from the neoplasm of the gland.","Symptoms at presentation depend upon whether the disease process is acute or chronic.
Acute dacryoadenitis: It may present acutely with:-
- Swelling of the lateral third of the upper lid.
- Pain in the lid with associated feeling of pressure in the eye.
- Redness of the lid.
- Conjunctival swelling.
- Conjunctival redness.
- Mucopurulent discharge from the eye.
- Swelling of the lymph nodes (submandibular).
- Bulging of the eyeball.
- Downward and inward displacement of the globe.
- Difficulty in eye movements.
Patient may have associated systemic features like fever, malaise, upper respiratory tract infection.
Chronic dacryoadenitis: Chronic dacryoadenitis has less severe presentation than acute dacryoadenitis. It is usually not associated with pain and the ocular signs are minimal. It may show:-
- Enlarged lacrimal gland which is mobile.
- Mild to severe features of dry eye.","The causes of lacrimal gland inflammation may be classified as:-
- Infectious.
- Idiopathic.
- Autoimmune.
- Lymphoproliferative.
Infectious dacryoadenitis: It may be:-
Viral dacryoadenitis: Viral dacryoadenitis is more common than bacterial, particularly in children and young adults. Viruses affecting lacrimal gland may be:-
- Epstein-barr and mumps viruses (common causative agents).
- Infectious mononucleosis.
- Adenovirus.
- Herpes zoster virus.
- Herpes simplex virus.
- Rhinovirus.
- Cytomegalovirus.
- Coxsackievirus A.
- Echovirus.
Bacterial dacryoadenitis: Acute suppurative bacterial dacryoadenitis is less common. Bacteria affecting lacrimal gland are:-
- Staphylococcus aureus.
- Streptococcus.
- Haemophilus influenzae.
- Klebsiella pneumoniae.
- Pseudomonas.
- Moraxella.
- Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
- Treponema pallidum.
- Mycobacterium leprae.
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
- Borrelia burgdorferi.
- Diptheroids.
- Micrococcus.

Fungal dacryoadenitis: It is rare and may be caused by:-
- Histoplasmosis.
- Blastomycosis.
Protozoal dacryoadenitis: It may rarely be caused by organisms like acanthamoeba.
Idiopathic dacryoadenitis:
Idiopathic is a nonspecific dacryoadenitis and is the most common histopathological diagnosis made for the lacrimal gland lesions. It causes inflammation and fibrosis in the gland. As the name suggests, the cause is unknown and bacterial or viral antigens are not identified. There is increased co-morbidity with autoimmune diseases that are not known to be related with lacrimal gland disease.
Autoimmune dacryoadenitis:
The lacrimal gland is often affected by autoimmune disorders and may be the first or only presentation. Lacrimal gland may be affected as:-
- Sarcoidosis dacryoadenitis.
- Sjögren’s dacryoadenitis.
- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener granulomatosis) dacryoadenitis.
- Immunoglobulin G4-related (IgG4) dacryoadenitis.
- Lymphoplasmacytic dacryoadenitis (rare).
Inflammatory process in Graves disease and orbital inflammatory syndrome may also cause dacryoadenitis.
Lymphoproliferative dacryoadenitis:
Lymphoproliferative tumours may also cause orbital and lacrimal gland inflammation. Inflammation may be present in:-
- Lacrimal gland lymphoma.
- Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.
Other epithelial neoplastic tumours like pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma may also show signs of inflammation.","Diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation of the patient and the supportive tests being conducted.
Patient may present with:-
In acute dacryoadenitis:
- There is usually unilateral, severe pain, associated redness with pressure sensation in superotemporal region of the eye.
- Acute and rapid onset of disease.
In chronic dacryoadenitis:
- Unilateral or bilateral painless enlargement of the lacrimal gland, may be present over a month, in superotemporal part of the eye.
This is more common than acute dacryoadenitis.
Examination of patient shows:-
In acute dacryoadenitis:
- Swelling of the lateral third of the upper lid (lid may assume S shape).
- Erythema or redness of the lid.
- Chemosis (conjunctival swelling).
- Conjunctival redness.
- Mucopurulent discharge from the eyes.
- Swelling of the lymph nodes (submandibular).
- Proptosis (bulging of the eyeball).
- Infero-medial displacement of the globe.
- Restriction of ocular movements.
Patient may have associated systemic features like fever, malaise, upper respiratory tract infection.
In chronic dacryoadenitis:
- Enlarged lacrimal gland which is mobile.
- Mild to severe features of dry eye.
- No tenderness over the swelling.
- Ocular signs are not there or are minimal.
Laboratory studies:
Acute dacryoadenitis: Following tests may be conducted in acute dacryoadenitis:-
- Examination of smear of discharge from the eye.
- Culture and sensitivity of the discharge from the eye.
- Blood culture.
Chronic dacryoadenitis: Chronic dacryoadenitis is usually associated with chronic systemic conditions. Test may be:-
- Lacrimal gland biopsy.
Imaging studies:
- Computerised tomography (CT) scan of the orbits with contrast medium may show oblong, diffuse enlargement of the lacrimal gland. There is marked enhancement in delineation with contrast medium in acute dacryoadenitis unlike chronic dacryoadenitis which does not show enhancement. Lacrimal gland changes may be bilateral in chronic dacryoadenitis unlike acute dacryoadenitis.
- No compressive changes in the contiguous bone or globe in CT scan. Compressive changes are usually present in lacrimal gland tumours.
Histopathologic examination of lacrimal gland:
Lacrimal gland biopsy is not indicated in acute dacryoadenitis.
Histopathological features of dacryoadenitis in certain diseases are:-
- Sarcoidosis: There is non-caseating granuloma with lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis of acini.
- Graves disease: It shows lymphocytic infiltration, oedematous fibrous tissue and glandular degeneration.
- Sjögren’s syndrome: This shows infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells.
- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis): There is granulomatous inflammation with or without giant cells, collagen necrosis and vasculitis.
- IgG4 –related dacryoadenitis: There is lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with lymphoid follicles often with reactive germinal centers, loss of acini, periductal and interlobular fibrosis. There are IgG4 positive plasma cells.
Dacryoadenitis should be distinguished from conditions like:
- Dry eye syndrome.
- Exophthalmos.
- Chalazion.
- Hordeolum.
- Preseptal cellulitis.
- Orbital cellulitis.
- Orbital dermoid.
- Lacrimal gland tumours.","Management of the disease should be under medical supervision.
Management depends upon the onset of disease process and its aetiology.
Acute dacryoadenitis:
- Viral dacryoadenitis: It is usually self-limiting and does not require any treatment. Supportive measures, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine (NSAID), suffices.
- Bacterial dacryoadenitis: Broad spectrum antibiotics (such as cephalosporins) may be started with, awaiting culture report.
- Fungal dacryoadenitis: It may require anti-fungal agents.
- Protozoal dacryoadenitis: Specific antiamoebic may be prescribed.
Inflammatory non-infectious dacryoadenitis is investigated for systemic disease and is treated accordingly.
Chronic dacryoadenitis:
In chronic dacryoadenitis, underlying systemic disease is treated, which is guided by lacrimal gland biopsy.
Prognosis:
Acute dacryoadenitis: Acute dacryoadenitis is self-limited mostly and therefore carries a good prognosis.
Chronic dacryoadenitis: Prognosis depends upon the underlying disease and its management."
Diabetic Retinopathy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/diabetic-retinopathy,"Diabetes mellitus is caused due to lack or diminished effectiveness of endogenous insulin and is characterised by hyperglycaemia.
There are two broad types:
Type I: This is known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). It is characterised by insulin deficiency. Usually it has juvenile onset but may occur at any age. Patients are prone to ketoacidosis and weight loss.
Type II: This is known as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or maturity onset diabetes mellitus. It occurs in middle aged/ older people who are often obese. There is impaired insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance. Patients may be managed with oral hypoglycaemic agents (drugs which lower blood sugar level). Patients may eventually need insulin especially those with ketonuria or dehydration. This does not mean that IDDM has developed.
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by changes in retinal blood vessels that occur in patients with diabetes mellitus. DR is a retinal microangiopathy affecting arterioles, capillaries and the venules. However, larger vessels may be involved as well.
Central retina or macular area is located between main superior and inferior retinal artery and vein. The area beyond these main vessels is the peripheral retina.
Retinopathy has features of both micro-vascular occlusion and micro-vascular leakage of plasma constituents due to breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Micro-vascular occlusion leads to arteriovenous shunts with capillary blockage and neovascularisation (new vessel formation). Micro-vascular leakage may cause haemorrhage and diffuse or localised retinal oedema. This disease can affect vision.
Diabetic retinopathy is broadly divided as:
- Background Diabetic retinopathy.
- Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy.
- Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy (PDR).","Patients are generally asymptomatic in the initial stages of the disease.

In advanced stages of disease, patient may experience:
- Blurring of vision.
- Progressive reduction of visual acuity.
- Fluctuation of vision.
- Presence of floaters.
- Distortion of images.
- Flashes of light (photopsia).
- Defects in the field of vision.","Diabetic retinopathy occurs in patients with Diabetes mellitus, more so in IDDM.

Risk factors for development of Diabetic retinopathy:
- Duration of Diabetes: Probability and incidence of developing Diabetic retinopathy is related to the duration of Diabetes. This is the most important factor.
- Control of Diabetes: Though control of Diabetes mellitus will not prevent Diabetic retinopathy, it delays development by few years.
- Other factors having adverse effect on DR:
    These include:
- Systemic hypertension.
- Pregnancy.
- Renal disease.
- Anaemia.

Ischaemic retina secretes Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).
VEGF leads to:
- Retinal oedema due to increased vascular permeability.
-    Angiogenesis or formation of new blood vessels.","Patients have increased fasting and postprandial (taken two hours after meals) blood sugar levels. Glycosylated or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is a measure of glycaemic control over the last three months. Besides, patients have systemic features of Diabetes mellitus.
Features of Background Diabetic retinopathy:
- Micro-aneurysms: Micro-aneurysms appear as small round dots, usually seen temporal to the macula. Micro-aneurysms coated with blood are indistinguishable from dot haemorrhages.
- Haemorrhages: Superficially placed haemorrhages appear as Flame-shaped haemorrhages. Haemorrhages in the deeper layers of retina appear as ‘dot’ and ‘blot’ haemorrhages.
- Hard exudates: Exudates are composed of lipoprotein and lipid filled macrophages and typically surround leaking micro-vascular lesions and may take circinate (circular or ring shaped) pattern. These may be absorbed over a period of time.
- Retinal oedema: Retinal oedema is characterised by retinal thickening which obscures underlying layers of retina. Fovea (point of retina through which an object is seen) may assume cystoid appearance due to progressive retinal oedema. Retinal oedema may present as ‘macular oedema’ or as ‘clinically significant macular oedema’.
Macular oedema: Macular oedema is the presence of retinal thickening or hard exudates within one disc diameter (disc is the point of exit of optic nerve and is 1500µm in size) of the center of fovea.
Clinically significant macular oedema (CSMO): This is characterised by the presence of one or more of the following features.
- Retinal oedema within 500µm of the center of fovea.
- Hard exudates within 500µm of the fovea, associated with adjacent retinal thickening, which may be outside the limit of 500µm.
- Retinal oedema of one disc diameter or larger, any part of which is within one disc diameter of the center of fovea.

Features of Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: Retinal changes in Pre-proliferative DR are produced due to ischaemia and consists of:
- Vascular appearance: Venules show beading, looping or sausage like segmentation. Arterioles may be narrowed or even obliterated.
- Retinal infarcts: These appear as dark blot haemorrhages.
- Cotton wool spots: Ischaemia due to capillary occlusion may cause damage to nerve fiber layer appearing as cotton wool spots in multiple areas.
- Intra-retinal micro-vascular abnormality (IRMA): IRMAs are located within retina and do not cross major retinal blood vessels. These appear similar to flat retinal neovascularisation.

Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR): PDR is more common in IDDM and show features of:
- Neovascularisation: New vessels may appear on the optic nerve head (new vessels at disc or NVD) or along major temporal vessels (new vessels elsewhere or NVE). Over one-quarter of the retina has to be non-perfused before NVD develops. Later, there may be formation of fibro-vascular epiretinal membrane in the potential vitreoretinal space.
- Vitreous detachment or separation: Formation of fibro-vascular epiretinal membrane in potential vitreoretinal space may lead to total or partial posterior vitreous detachment. The fibro-vascular tissue may become adherent to posterior vitreous face. Pull on fibro-vascular tissue by the vitreous detachment may lead to haemorrhage in vitreoretinal space or within the vitreous. PDR is asymptomatic until the onset of vitreous haemorrhage.
- Haemorrhage: Haemorrhage may occur in potential vitreoretinal space (retrohyaloid space) as pre-retinal haemorrhage or into the vitreous gel (intravitreal haemorrhage).Intravitreal (Intra-gel) haemorrhage takes longer to clear as compared to pre-retinal haemorrhage. Pre-retinal haemorrhage takes crescentic shape along the posterior vitreous detachment.
Complications of Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: PDR may lead to retinal detachment, persistent vitreous haemorrhage, rubeosis iridis (formation of new vessels on iris) or formation of opaque membrane on posterior surface of detached vitreous.

Laboratory tests for Diabetic Retinopathy:
- Fluorescein Angiography (FA): Fluorescein is a fluorescent dye. Fluorescein Angiography helps in assessing degree of retinal ischaemia and delineates retinal vascular abnormalities. Microaneurysms appear as hyper-fluorescent spots which leaks the dye in late phases of FA. ‘Blot’ and ‘Dot’ haemorrhages appear hypo-fluorescent in contrast to micro-aneurysms. Nonperfused areas appear as dark patches or homogeneous hypo-fluorescent areas. NVD and NVE also show leakage of dye on FA. Intra-retinal micro-vascular abnormalities do not leak dye.
- Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): OCT generates cross-sectional image of the retina with light. OCT helps in measuring retinal thickening. Periodic OCT determine whether the retinal thickening in macular area due to oedema is regressing or not with treatment. Any vitreomacular traction can also be assessed.
- B-scan ultrasonography: B-scan ultrasonography evaluates retina when the media is not clear e.g. vitreous haemorrhage.

Diabetic retinopathy should be distinguished from conditions like retinal vein occlusion, retinal vasculitis, sickle cell retinopathy or ocular ischaemic syndrome.","It should be strictly carried out under medical supervision.
Goals of management of Diabetes mellitus and Diabetic retinopathy are the good control of disease process and maintaining HbA1c level within a range of 6-7 %.
Change in lifestyle with regular exercise helps in controlling Diabetes mellitus which in turn reduces complications including DR.
Drug therapy for Diabetes mellitus: Drugs may be from various groups like biguanides, sulfonylureas, meglitinide derivatives, thiazolidinediones, alpha- glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors or insulin.
Drug therapy for Diabetic retinopathy:
- Intravitreal triamcinolone: Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone may be used in cases of Diabetic macular oedema.
- Intravitreal Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (Anti-VEGF): Intravitreal injection of Anti-VEGF help in reducing diabetic macular oedema, NVD and NVE. Bevacizumab (Avastin) and Ranibizumab (Lucentis) are VEGF antibodies and antibody fragments (Anti-VEGF) respectively, being used as intravitreal injection. Intravitreal Aflibercept (Eylea) may also be given to patients with diabetic macular oedema.
Laser Photocoagulation for Diabetic retinopathy:
Laser photocoagulation is a non-invasive technique that has relatively low rate of complication and a significant success rate. Highly focused beam of laser causes coagulation in the target tissue.
Background Diabetic retinopathy: All eyes with CSMO are treated with laser photocoagulation. Prior fluorescein angiography delineates the area and extent of oedema. The technique of laser photocoagulation may be:-
- Direct laser photocoagulation: Laser burns are applied to microaneurysms and micro-vascular lesions in the center of hard exudates located between 500µm to 3000µm from center of the fovea.
- Grid photocoagulation: Grid photocoagulation is applied in areas of diffuse retinal thickening located at posterior pole of eye, 500µm each from the center of the fovea and from the temporal margin of the optic disc.
Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: Photocoagulation is done when fluorescein angiography shows extensive areas of capillary non-perfusion in patients who had proliferative DR in the fellow eye.
Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: Patients with high risk of vision loss should be treated. Features of high risk are:-
- NVD or neovascularisation more than one-quarter disc in area within 1500µm of the disc.
- Less extensive NVD associated with vitreous or retrohyaloid haemorrhage.
- NVE more than one-half disc in size associated with vitreous or retrohyaloid haemorrhage. 
Panretinal Photocoagulation (PRP) is given in scatter pattern extending from posterior fundus to the peripheral retina.
Recurrence is further treated with photocoagulation or cryotherapy. 
Surgical management in the form of pars plana vitrectomy may be done in complicated cases like persistent vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment or rubeosis iridis."
Duane Retraction Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/duane-retraction-syndrome,"Duane retraction syndrome is characterised by retraction of globe (eyeball) on attempted adduction (inward movement) caused due to co-contraction of both medial and lateral rectus muscle of the involved eye.
Duane retraction syndrome is a non-progressive congenital disorder of eye movement, which may occur either in isolation or in the form of syndrome associated with other congenital defects, most common is perceptive deafness with associated speech disorder. It may be associated with strabismus in primary gaze.
Horizontal eye movement is governed by lateral rectus muscle, which pulls the eye outward and by medial rectus muscle, which pulls the eye inward. When lateral rectus muscle of an eye contracts and pull the eyeball outward, the medial rectus of the same eye relaxes. The contra-lateral medial rectus muscle contracts and the lateral rectus muscle relaxes to a similar extent for smooth movement of eyeballs.
Classification:
There are three main types (Huber classification):
- Type 1: This is characterised by limitation or absence of abduction (outward movement) with normal or mildly restricted adduction. This is the most common type.
- Type 2: This is characterised by limited adduction with normal or mildly restricted abduction. This is the least common type.
- Type 3: This type shows limitation of both abduction and adduction.","Duane retraction syndrome may be associated with some or all of the following features:
- Retraction of globe on adduction.
- Complete or partial limitation of abduction.
- Narrowing of palpebral fissure on adduction.
- Widening of palpebral fissure on attempted abduction.
- Partial limitation of adduction.
- Convergence insufficiency.
- Oblique movement of globe on attempted adduction.
- Upshoot or downshoot of globe with adduction (Leash or Bridle Phenomenon).","Duane retraction syndrome is thought to be due to aberrant innervations of medial and lateral rectus muscles. In addition, structural anomalies of the muscle or primary anomaly of the brainstem may be contributing as aetiological factors. Most likely, both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of this syndrome.
Duane retraction syndrome may occur as an isolated phenomenon or present as a syndrome.
Isolated form:
This comprises 90% of cases which are sporadic and unilateral. Remaining 10% may be inherited, bilateral and may have vertical movement abnormalities. These may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive.

Association with syndromes:
This may be associated with different syndromes like:
- Goldenhar syndrome: It is characterised by malformation of jaw, cheek and ear usually on one side of the face.
- Morning glory syndrome: It is characterised by abnormalities of the optic disc.
- Moebius syndrome: This may show congenital paresis of facial (VIIth) and abducent (VIth) cranial nerves.","Patient may present with:
- Manifest squint.
- Reduced abduction in affected eye.
- Loss of binocularity.
- Head turn to maintain fusion.
- Certain associated eye conditions like heterochromia, pupillary abnormalities, cataract or microphthalmos (small eyeball).
Patient may carry an old picture of strabismus.

Clinical features of different types:
- Type 1: The abduction or ability to move the eye outward is limited, but adduction or ability to move the eye inward is normal or nearly so. There is retraction of the eyeball (enophthalmos) with narrowing of the palpebral fissure on adduction. The eyeball assume its normal position and the palpebral fissure widens again on attempted abduction.
- Type 2: In this type, affected eye shows limitation of adduction but the abduction is normal or nearly so. On attempted adduction, there is retraction of the globe and narrowing of the palpebral fissure.
- Type 3: There is limitation of both adduction and abduction. The eyeball retracts and the palpebral fissure narrows on attempted adduction.","Non surgical management:
Patient with orthophoria (straight eyes in primary position) should be managed conservatively.
- Associated refractive error may be corrected with suitable spectacles or contact lenses. Compensatory head turn patients may be treated by incorporating prisms in glasses.
- Similarly, any associated amblyopia is treated.

Surgical management:
Surgery should be avoided if patient shows some form of binocular vision.
Surgery is considered when a patient show features like:
- Significant deviation of eye in primary position.
- Significant head turn
- Severe narrowing of palpebral fissure on adduction.
-    For cosmetically unacceptable up-shoots or down-shoots
Depending on the type, surgical procedure may be:
- Recession of the medial rectus muscle and/or lateral rectus muscle with possible Y-splitting.
- Posterior fixation suture."
Dacryocystitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/dacryocystitis,"Dacryocystitis is an inflammation affecting lacrimal sac.
Lacrimal excretory system drain tears from eye to the nasal cavity. Stagnation of tears due to blockage of lacrimal drainage system can result in dacryocystitis.
Lacrimal drainage system consists of:-
Punctum (plural puncta): Punctum is located near the medial (inner) end of each eyelid and it joins vertical canaliculus.
Vertical canaliculus (plural canaliculi): Vertical canaliculus, also known as ampulla (plural ampulae) is about 2mm in length and it continues with horizontal canaliculus.
Horizontal canaliculus: Horizontal canaliculus is about 8mm in length. Canaliculus from upper and lower eyelid joins to form common canaliculus in about 90% of cases. A small flap of mucosa (valve of Rosenmuller) overhangs at the opening of common canaliculus into the lateral wall of lacrimal sac.
Lacrimal sac: Lacrimal sac is about 10mm long and lies in lacrimal fossa near medial canthus (where upper and lower lid meet internally) of the eye. It continues as nasolacrimal duct.
Nasolacrimal duct: Nasolacrimal duct is about 12mm long and joins lacrimal sac with the nasal cavity (nasolacrimal duct opens into the inferior meatus of the nose). The opening of the duct is partially covered by a mucosal fold known as valve of Hasner.

The contraction and expansion of lacrimal sac with each blink (being governed by action of orbicularis muscle) results in movement of tears from eyes to the nose.
Excessive watering from the eyes may be due to:-
- Lacrimation: Lacrimation is caused by reflex overproduction of tears due to irritation of the cornea or conjunctiva.
- Obstructive epiphora: Obstructive epiphora is due to mechanical obstruction of the drainage of tears.
- Lacrimal pump failure: Lacrimal pump failure is due to lax lower lid or weakness of orbicularis muscle.

Dacryocystitis may be congenital or acquired.
Congenital dacryocystitis is usually due to non-canalisation of the nasolacrimal duct.
Acquired dacryocystitis may be acute or chronic.
Acute dacryocystitis is characterised by sudden onset of acute pain and redness in the medial canthal area.
Chronic dacryocystitis is characterised by chronic inflammation or infection of the lacrimal sac resulting in epiphora (watering from the eye).","The patient usually present with:-
Congenital dacryocystitis: The lower end of nasolacrimal duct may be non-canalised at birth. It gets canalised on its own in most of the cases during first few weeks of life. During non-canalised period, child may have symptoms like:-
- Watering from the eye.
- Mucopurulent discharge from the eyes, if there is superadded infection due to blockage.
Besides non-canalisation, neonatal infection may also cause congenital dacryocystitis.

Acute dacryocystitis: It may be associated with one or more of following features:-
- Pain of sudden onset, redness and swelling overlying lacrimal sac area.
- Watering from the eyes.
- Discharging wound overlying lacrimal sac area.
- Conjunctival redness.
- Lid swelling.
Patient may have systemic features like fever and general prostration.

Chronic dacryocystitis: It may be associated with:-
- Watering from the eyes.
- Mucopurulent discharge from the eyes, if there is associated infection.
- Conjunctival redness.
- Swelling in the region of lacrimal sac.","The causative agents for dacryocystitis may be:-
In children:-
- Staphylococcus aureus.
- β-haemolytic streptococcus.
- Pneumococcus.
- Haemophilus influenzae.
In adults:-
- Staphylococcus epidermidis.
- Staphylococcus aureus.
- Pneumococcus.
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
- Fusobacterium
Dacryocystitis usually occurs due to obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct which leads to stagnation of tears.
Dacryoliths or concretions may also block lacrimal drainage system. Dacryoliths may be associated with Fungal infection.
Nasal diseases like rhinitis, deviated nasal septum, nasal polyp or hypertrophy of inferior turbinate may block the opening of nasolacrimal duct in the nose, thereby leading to stagnation of tears.
Abnormalities of midface should also be considered as contributory factor.
Occult malignancy or mass may present as dacryocystitis.","The diagnosis depends upon clinical presentation and tests conducted thereof:-
Congenital dacryocystitis: Child may present with:-
- Watering from the eye.
- Mucopurulent discharge from the eyes, if there is superadded infection due to blockage.
- Regurgitation of discharge from the punctum on applying pressure over lacrimal sac area.
- Congenital lacrimal sac mucocele (also called congenital dacryocele or amniontocele). This is a collection of amniotic fluid or mucus secretion in lacrimal sac, caused due to imperforate valve of Hasner. It present as a bluish cystic swelling at or below medial canthal area. It should be differentiated from encephalocele which present as pulsatile swelling lying above medial canthal area.
Congenital dacryocystitis should be differentiated from conditions like neonatal conjunctivitis, punctual atresia and congenital glaucoma which also cause watering from the eyes.

Acute dacryocystitis: It may be associated with one or more of following features:-
- Pain/ tenderness, erythema and oedema over lacrimal sac area.
- Epiphora or watering from the eyes.
- Discharging fistula from lacrimal sac through the skin.
- Associated conjunctivitis.
- Preseptal cellulitis.
- Orbital cellulitis.
There may be associated fever and general prostration.
Chronic dacryocystitis: It may be associated with:-
- Watering from the eyes.
- Mucopurulent discharge from the eyes, if there is associated infection.
- Chronic or recurrent conjunctivitis.
- Mucocele in the region of lacrimal sac.
- Regurgitation of discharge from punctum on applying pressure over mucocele.
Dacryocystitis should be differentiated from conditions like:-
- Acute ethmoidal sinusitis.
- Punctal ectropion.
- Eyelid ectropion.
- Infected sebaceous cyst.
- Cellulitis.
- Allergic rhinitis.
Laboratory diagnosis: Following tests may be conducted for dacryocystitis:-
- Examination of smear of discharge from the eye.
- Culture and sensitivity of the discharge from the eye.
- Blood culture.
Imaging studies:
- Plain X-ray: Plain X-ray may help in diagnosing skeletal abnormality or any foreign body as a causative factor.
- CT scan: CT scan is useful in suspected cases of occult malignancy or mass.
- Dacryocystography (DCG): Radiographs are taken after injecting contrast medium into canaliculi.
- Subtraction DCG with CT scan: DCG is done by obtaining bone-free images by subtraction for better delineation.
- Lacrimal Scintillography: Tears are labelled with technetium-99m and its progress is monitored through drainage system to look for any abnormality.
Other tests:
- Fluorescein dye disappearance test: This is performed by instilling fluorescein dye in conjunctival sac. Prolonged retention of dye usually more than 5 minutes indicate delayed drainage.
- Primary Jones dye test: It differentiates partial obstruction of lacrimal passages from primary hypersecretion of tears. Fluorescein dye is instilled in conjunctival sac and its recovery from nose is assessed. Fluorescein may be recovered from nose in primary hypersecretion. Non recovery of fluorescein from nose may be due to partial obstruction or failure of lacrimal pump.
- Secondary Jones dye test: It identifies the probable site of partial obstruction. Topical anaesthetic drops are instilled and residual fluorescein is washed out from conjunctival sac. The drainage system is then irrigated using normal saline. Recovery of fluorescein stained saline from nose indicates partial obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. If unstained saline is obtained from the nose, it may be due to partial obstruction of the upper drainage system (punctum, canaliculus or common canaliculus) or may be due to defective lacrimal pump.
- Nasal endoscopy: This may help in ruling out hypertrophy of inferior turbinate, any deviation of nasal septum or narrowing of inferior meatus.
Histological examination:
There may be chronic inflammation and fibrosis in lacrimal sac.
Lacrimal sac may also show loss of goblet cells, focal ulceration, abscess or granuloma formation.
Nasolacrimal duct and nasal mucosa may also show signs of chronic inflammation and fibrosis.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Congenital dacryocystitis:
- Local massage over lacrimal sac: This is carried out by blocking the common canaliculus with finger and then stroking downward to increase hydrostatic pressure within lacrimal sac, which may open the membranous obstruction in the nasolacrimal duct.
- Topical and/or systemic antibiotics for superadded infection.
- Probing and syringing: Probing is done to open obstructive membrane near lower end of nasolacrimal duct in cases in which the duct does not open spontaneously. Syringing is performed after probing. Antibiotic drops are prescribed after syringing. Probing may be repeated in cases which do not improve.
- Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): DCR is a surgical procedure (external approach done through skin) in which a communication is made between medial wall of lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity, for drainage. This is done in failed cases of probing.
Acute dacryocystitis:
- Systemic broad spectrum antibiotics are prescribed.
- Warm compresses may help in resolution of the disease.
- Stab incision of the skin: Impending perforation is treated with stab incision of the lacrimal sac through the skin. Stab incision may lead to fistula formation, but it is rare.
- Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): When the acute infection has been controlled, a DCR may be needed to relieve any permanent obstruction.
Chronic dacryocystitis:
- Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): This is the procedure done in patients having longstanding epiphora or mucocele, to relieve obstruction.
- Endoscopic DCR: This is an endonasal procedure (through the nose) which may be done with or without laser."
Diphtheria,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/diphtheria,"Diphtheria
Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by the bacteriumCorynebacterium diphtheria, which primarily infects the throat and upper airways, and produces a toxin affecting other organs. One type of diphtheria affects the throat and sometimes the tonsils. Another type causes ulcers on the skin; these are more common in the tropics (places where all twelve months have mean temperatures of at least 18°C). Diphtheria particularly affects the children aged 1 to 5 years of age. In temperate climates (have four seasons: summer, autumn, winter and spring) diphtheria tends to occur during the colder months.
Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically; however diphtheria is still a significant child health problem in countries with poor coverage of Expanded programme on immunization (EPI). In countries endemic for diphtheria as in India, the disease occurs mostly as sporadic cases or in small outbreaks. Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children.
Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), National Centre for disease control (NCDC), Delhi, reported 7 outbreaks of diphtheria in India during the year 2014.","The illness has an acute onset and the main characteristics are sore throat, low fever and swollen glands in the neck,
Within two to three days, a thick coating can build up in the throat or nose, making it very hard to breathe and swallow. This thick gray coating is called a ""pseudomembrane"".
Laryngeal diphtheria often presents with cough and hoarseness of voice.
The toxin may cause myocarditis or peripheral neuropathy in severe cases.","Diphtheria is caused by bacteriumCorynebacterium diphtheria. This is gram positive and non motile organism. It has no invasive power, but produces a powerful exotoxin. Diptheria bacilli are readily killed by heat and chemical agents.
The diphtheria toxin causes a membrane of dead tissue to build up over the throat and tonsils, making breathing and swallowing difficult.
Transmission:
Transmission is most often person-to-person spread from the respiratory tract. Rarely, transmission may occur from skin lesions or articles soiled with discharges from lesions of infected persons (fomites).
Incubation period is 2-6 days, occasionally longer.","Diagnosis of diphtheria is usually made on the basis of clinical presentation since it is imperative to begin presumptive therapy quickly.
The laboratory diagnosis includes:
a) Isolation of the organism from clinical specimens (throat and nasal swabs and swabs can be collected from the skin lesions and wounds, in case of cutaneous diphtheria)
i) Microscopic examination of stained smears (Grams staining or Alberts staining) prepared from swabs.
ii) Culture- Any suspected isolates of C.diphtheriae during culture should be subjected to the following tests
1. Biotyping
2. Toxigenicity testing (Elek's test)
3. Antibiotic susceptibility test by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) (E test) method
b) Serological tests -Demonstration of a fourfold rise in antibody titre in paired sera samples collected 10-14 days apart (Both samples are to be collected before administration of either diphtheria toxoid or antitoxin) using either Indirect haemagglutination (IHA) test or Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay( ELISA) test.","Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin to neutralize the effects of the toxin and antibiotics to kill the bacteria.
Administration of diphtheria antitoxin at the earliest is the most important element in the treatment of diphtheria, specially, respiratory diphtheria.
In addition to antitoxin, every case should be treated with appropriate antibiotics.
Respiratory support and airway maintenance should also be provided as needed.
The disease is usually not contagious 48 hours after antibiotics are instituted."
Dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/dracunculiasis-guinea-worm-disease,"Dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease) is a parasitic disease caused byDracunculus medinensis that is a long, thread-like worm. Dracunculiasis is commonly known as guinea-worm disease (GW). It is transmitted exclusively when people drink stagnant water contaminated with parasite-infected water fleas (Cyclops- that carry infective guinea-worm larvae).
Dracunculiasis is rarely fatal, but infected people become crippled, non-functional for weeks. It affects people in rural, deprived and isolated communities who depend mainly on open surface water sources such as ponds for drinking water.
An estimated 3.5 million cases of dracunculiasis occurred during the mid-1980s in 21 countries worldwide, 17 countries of which were in Africa. The number of reported cases fell to only 22 cases globally in 2015 (lowest number of cases so far) compared with 126 cases in 2014. In 2015, cases were reported from four endemic countries - Chad (9), Mali (5), South Sudan (5) and Ethiopia (3). World Health Organization (WHO) has certified 198 countries, territories and areas (belonging to 186 Member States) as free of dracunculiasis.
In India the GW disease was endemic in 89 districts in seven states. Almost two-thirds of the total cases during 1984 occurred in Rajasthan (38%) and Madhya Pradesh (29%). Karnataka (13%), Andhra Pradesh (11%), Maharashtra (8%) and Gujarat (1%) accounted for the remaining cases. After implementation of National Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of India in 1983-84, the last case of GW disease was reported in 1996. Disease has been eradicated and India was declared as guinea worm disease free country by WHO in 2000.
As global eradication of guinea worm disease has not been achieved, the States (previously endemic for GW disease) are continuing the routine surveillance for the disease till global eradication is achieved.","People do not usually have symptoms until about one year after they become infected with parasite.

Person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in the area from where worm/ worms come out. In 90% cases site is usually lower legs and feet.
The adult female worm comes out of the skin as whitish filament; it can be very painful, slow, and disabling period (duration of emergence: 1 to 3 weeks).
The pain may get worse if the wound develops a secondary bacterial infection.","Cause, transmission, life cycle and incubation period: 

Dracunculiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Dracunculus medinensis, a long, thread-like worm.
The transmission cycle (from the time infection occurs until a mature worm emerges from the body) takes about 10–14 months to complete .
During the emergence of worm from the body, a painful blister develops mostly on the lower legs and feet. One or more worms may emerge from the body accompanied by burning pain.
To relieve the burning pain patients often immerse the infected part of the body in water. The worm(s) then releases thousands of larvae (baby worms) into the water.
These larvae are ingested by tiny crustaceans or copepods, also called water fleas and mature in to the infective stage.
People when drinking contaminated water also swallow the infected water fleas. The water fleas are killed in the stomach and the larvae are liberated. These larvae penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate through the body.
The fertilized female worm (which measures from 60–100 cm long) migrates under the skin tissues until it reaches its exit point, usually at the lower limbs.
A blister or swelling is formed at exit point from which parasite emerges.","Clinical presentation of guinea –worm disease is so typical and well known to local people in endemic areas that it is sufficient to make diagnosis.
Examination of the fluid discharged by the worm can show rhabditiform larvae.
No serologic test is available.","There is no drug to treat Guinea worm disease and nor any vaccine to prevent infection.
Once part of the worm begins to come out of the wound, the rest of the worm can only be pulled out, a few centimeters each day by winding it around a piece of gauze or a small stick. This process usually takes several weeks.
Local cleansing of the lesion and local application of antibiotics will prevent secondary infection.
The worm can also be surgically removed by a doctor before an ulcer forms."
Disabilities,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/disabilities,"Disability is a global public health problem as people with disability, throughout the life course, face widespread barriers in accessing health and related services, such as rehabilitation, and has worse health outcomes than people without disability. Disability is any continuing condition that restricts everyday activities. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations.
Disability is not just a health problem; it is the interaction between individuals with a health condition and personal and environmental factors (such as negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social supports). Overcoming the difficulties faced by people with disabilities requires interventions to remove environmental and social barriers.
Over 1 billion people, about 15% of the world's population have some form of disability. Of this number 110 million to 190 million people of 15 years and older have significant difficulties in functioning and 93 million people less than 15 years of age live with a moderate or severe disability.
In India according to the Census 2011, 2.2% of population had some form of disability. The prevalence of disability was found to be more in rural areas (2.24%) as compared to urban areas (2.17%) and more among males (2.4%) than among females (2%). The proportion of different types of disability among people with disability reported as: (i) seeing 18.8%, (ii) hearing 18.9% (iii) speech 7.5% (iv) movement 20.3% (v) mental retardation 7.6% (vi) mental illness 2.7%, (vii) multiple disabilities 7.9% (viii) Any other 18.4%.
In the coming years, prevalence of disability will continue to increase due to increase in ageing populations and with the global increase in chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders, injuries, car crashes, falls, violence. 
All people with disabilities have the same general health care needs as everyone else; however they have greater unmet health care needs than people without disabilities. Evidence suggests that people with disabilities face barriers in accessing the health and rehabilitation services they need in many settings. According to World Health organization (WHO) estimates:

200 million people need glasses or other low vision devices and do not have access to them.
70 million people need a wheelchair, only 5-15% have access to one.
360million people globally have moderate to profound hearing loss and only 10% of global needs of hearing aids are met.
Half of the people with disabilities cannot afford health care.

People with disabilities have generally poorer health, lower education levels, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disability. This is due to many obstacles they face in their everyday life and due to lack of services available to them.
Disability is now understood to be a human rights issue. People are disabled by society, not just by their bodies. These barriers can be overcome, if governments, nongovernmental organizations, professionals and people with disabilities and their families work together.","General symptoms for a disabled person according to type of disability-
i. Disability in seeing/ visual disability: A visually disabled person does not have any light perception (both eyes taken together) or has light perception but cannot count fingers of a hand (with spectacles/contact lenses if he/she uses spectacles/contact lenses) from a distance of 3 meters (or 10 feet) in good day light with both eyes open.
The visually disabled persons may be categorized into two broad groups:
Blindness: A person who does not have light perception and a person who has light perception but cannot count fingers at a distance of 1 meter even with spectacles are taken as blind.
Low vision: A person who has light perception but cannot count fingers up to a distance of 3 meters even with spectacles is taken as a person with Low Vision.
ii. Disability in speech/speech disability: A person is unable to speak like normal persons.
iii. Disability in hearing/hearing disability: A person may have problem in hearing day to day conversational speech when hearing aid is not used. A person may have the following degrees of hearing disability:

A person, who does not hear at all or can only hear very loud sounds like thunder and crackers, is considered to have profound disability.
A person who can hear speech only when spoken to very loudly, near the ear is considered to have severe disability.
person often asks for repetitions when spoken to or needs to see the face of the person who is speaking is considered to have moderate disability.
A person who has difficulty in hearing but it does not interfere in day today conversation is considered to have mild disability.

(A person who has problem only in one ear is not considered as having hearing disability).
iv. Disability in movement/ locomotor disability
(a) Loss or absence or inactivity of whole or part of hand or leg or both (due to amputation, paralysis, cerebral palsy, deformity or dysfunction of joints) which affects his/her “normal ability to move self or objects” and
(b) those with physical deformities in the body (other than limbs), such as, hunch back, deformed spine regardless of whether the same caused loss or lack of normal movement of body are considered as disable with locomotor disability. Thus, dwarfs and persons with stiff neck of permanent nature who generally do not have difficulty in the normal movement of body and limbs are also to be treated as disabled.
v. Mental disability A mentally disabled person has difficulty in understanding routine instructions or does not carry out his/ her activities like others of similar age or exhibited behaviours like talking to self, laughing/crying, staring, violence, fear and suspicion without reason. The mentally disabled are categorized into two groups viz. mentally retarded and mentally ill. If persons with mental disability manifests this behaviour since birth/ childhood but before 18 years of age and the person was late in talking, sitting, standing or walking, they are classified as ‘mentally retarded’. The remaining mentally disabled persons are classified as ‘mentally ill’
vi. Leprosy Cured Persons who have been cured of leprosy and are having extreme physical deformity as well as advanced age which prevents him from undertaking any gainful occupation.","Risk factors for the disabilities:
Communicable diseases (Infectious diseases) such as lymphatic filariasis, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases; neurological consequences of some diseases such as encephalitis, meningitis, and childhood cluster diseases (such as measles, mumps, and poliomyelitis) contribute to disability.
Non communicable diseases (NCDs)-

Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis and cancer cause the majority of long-term disabilities. The increase in NCDs observed in all parts of the world, will have a profound effect on disability.
Lifestyle choices and personal behavior such as obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, illicit drugs that lead to non communicable diseases are also becoming major contributing factors;
Air pollution, occupational disease, poor water supply, sanitation, and personal and domestic hygiene, malnutrition also contribute for disability.

Injuries due to road traffic accidents, occupational injury, violence, conflicts, falls and landmines have long been recognized as contributors to disability.
Mental health problems- mental health retardation and mental illness are the causes of mental disability. In more than 50% cases mental retardation has been reported to be caused by serious illness or head injury in the childhood and birth defects. Mental retardation was observed mostly at birth or at very early ages of life while the problem of mental illness is more of an old age problem.
Those with lower education levels, lower incomes, and those who are unemployed were also more likely to suffer a disability.
There is higher risk of disability at older ages.","Diagnosis of particular disability may be done at health care centre with the help of a specialist. A concerned medical authority in Government hospital can issue a disability certificate*.
The disability certificate and/ or Identity card is the basic document that a person with any disability of more than 40 percent requires in order to avail any facilities, benefits or concessions under the available schemes.","Increasing evidence suggests that, as a group, people with disabilities experience poorer levels of health than the general population. By improving access to quality, affordable health care services, health outcomes for people with disabilities can be improved. Primary health-care services with the support of specialists can provide health services to people with disability. Health services should be focused for the following health conditions: 
Primary health conditions: A primary health condition is the possible starting point for impairment can lead to a wide range of impairments, including mobility, sensory, mental, and communication impairments.
Secondary conditions: Secondary conditions occur in addition to (and are related to) a primary health condition, and are both predictable and therefore preventable; such as depression is a common secondary condition in people with disabilities, osteoporosis is common in people with a spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy.
Co-morbid conditions occur in addition to (and are unrelated to) a primary health condition associated with disability. One study indicated that adults with developmental disabilities had a similar or greater rate of chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (due to increased physical inactivity) than people without disabilities.
Age-related conditions: The ageing process for some groups of people with disabilities begins earlier than usual and they may experience age related health conditions (such as osteoporosis, loss of strength and balance) more frequently.
Risk behaviours: People with disabilities have higher rates of engaging in risky behaviours such as smoking, alcohol conumption, poor diet and physical inactivity as compare to general population.
Violence :People with disabilities are at greater risk of violence than those without disabilities.
Unintentional injury: People with disabilities are at higher risk of unintentional injury from road traffic crashes, burns, falls, and accidents related to assistive devices.
Assistive technologies and assistive devices such as crutches, prostheses, wheelchairs, and tricycles in mobility impairments; hearing aids and cochlear implants for hearing impairments; ocular devices, talking books, and software for screen magnification and reading for people with visual impairments may be advised according to the user and the user’s environment.
Rehabilitation: It is an important aspect of management for people with disability. It involves combined and coordinated use of medical, social, educational, and vocational measures for training or retraining the individual to the highest possible level of functional ability.
Community-based rehabilitation (CBR) was initiated by WHO to enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities and their families; meet their basic needs; and ensure their inclusion and participation. CBR is implemented through the combined efforts of people with disabilities, their families and communities, and relevant government and non-government health, education, vocational, social and other services."
Dermatochalasis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/dermatochalasis,"Dermatochalasis is a term that is defined as excess upper and/or lower eyelid skin. The eyelid skin is thin and prone to fine wrinkling. Redundant skin is often associated with fat herniation, descent of eyebrows, and descent of mid-face. Fat herniation is most common in the superomedial region and in the inferomedial and central part. In addition, variable puffiness due to eyelid oedema and discolouration from venous leakage (black circles under eyes) develop with age. It is a common condition and is seen in elderly persons, but occasionally in young adults also. It is more common in the upper eyelid but may be seen in the lower eyelids as well.
Common factors which contribute to this lax and redundant eyelid tissue are

Ageing.
Loss of elastic tissue in the skin.
Weakening of the connective tissue of the eyelid.
Effect of gravity.
Solar and age-related degeneration of collagen.
Descent of brow complex (retro- orbicularis oculi fat or ROOF) and malar complex (suborbicularis oculi fat or SOOF).
Actinic exposure and smoking hasten the development of changes.","Dermatochalasis may be asymptomatic. It is usually a bilateral condition.
It may present with

Redundant upper eyelid skin that may be associated with herniation of orbital fat (steatoblepharon) through a weak septum.
Obstruction of superior visual fields due to excess lid skin.
Irritation of eyes.
Blepharitis.
Ectropion of the lower eyelid.
Entropion of the upper eyelid.
Dermatitis.
Fullness or heaviness of upper eyelids.
‘Bags’ in lower eyelids.
Wrinkles in lower eyelid and at lateral canthus.","Dermatochalasis is due to age-related loss of skin elasticity and weakening of the connective tissue of the eyelid, usually seen in elderly.
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of dermatochalasis is consistent with the normal ageing changes of the skin of eyelids. This includes loss of elastic fibers, thinning of the epidermis, and redundancy of the skin. Chronic infiltrate may be present when it is associated with dermatitis.
Histologically, epidermis appears thin and smooth. Dermis shows some loss of elastic and collagen tissue, along with an increase of capillary vascularity. There is often basophilic degeneration of the collagen (actinic elastosis), and a mild lymphocytic inflammatory reaction.
Systemic associations
Systemic diseases which predispose patients to develop dermatochalasis are

Thyroid eye disease.
Hereditary angioneurotic oedema.
Trauma.
Renal disease.
Amyloidosis.
Cutis laxa.
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
Xanthelasma.

Genetic factors may also have role in some patients.","Diagnosis depends upon the clinical features.
It produces cosmetic problem such as wrinkles in lower eyelid and at lateral canthus, ‘bags’ in lower eyelids, and fullness or heaviness of upper eyelids.
Functionally, it may cause blepharitis, dermatitis, upper eyelid entropion, ectropion of lower eyelid, irritation of eyes, and obstruction of superior visual fields.

Evaluation

Identify pre-existing blepharoptosis, brow ptosis, lacrimal gland prolapsed, or horizontal lid laxity.
Lateral bulging of the upper lid should be recognised as lacrimal gland prolapse and should be distinguished from pad of fat.
Coexistent dermatochalasis of the eyelids and browptosis may be tested by elevating the eyebrows.
The interpalpebral fissure and levator function, as well as the marginal reflex distance from the upper and lower eyelids, should be documented.
The eyelid crease should be measured in millimetres.


Differential diagnosis
Dermatochalasis may be differentiated from conditions like

Congenital or acquired ptosis.
Eyebrow ptosis.
Floppy eyelid syndrome.
Oedema of eyelid/ blepharochalasis.
Prolapse of lacrimal gland.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Management of dermatochalasis is mainly surgical.
Medical therapy

Lid hygiene and topical antibiotics may be required for blepharitis.
Topical steroids are helpful in dermatitis.
Topical lubricants are helpful in patients developing dry eyes.

Surgical therapy

Procedure like upper eyelid blepharoplasty to remove excess eyelid skin and orbital fat, with reconstruction of the upper eyelid crease, is helpful.
Patients with associated ptosis (drooping of eyelid) may require ptosis surgery.
Placement of temporary collagen punctal plugs, permanent punctal plugs or punctal cautery may be done in patients with dry eyes.


Prognosis
Results are usually good with proper diagnosis and surgical blepharoplasty."
Distichiasis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/distichiasis,"Distichiasis is a congenital or acquired condition in which there is an accessory row of cilia behind the normal row of eyelash cilia. This disorder may be familial in origin with an autosomal dominant inheritance, but may also be produced by acquired conditions such as severe inflammation or trauma. It is presumed to be due to differentiation of primary epithelial germ cells originally destined for development of meibomian or tarsal glands. Meibomian glands are modified sebaceous glands located in the tarsal plate of eyelids. In skin, pilo-sebaceous unit consists of sebaceous glands associated with hair follicle and sweat gland. It is believed that meibomian gland may undergo differentiation into primitive pilo-sebaceous unit which produces distichiasis.
The roots of eyelashes (cilias) lie against the anterior surface of the tarsal plate. The cilia come out of skin at the anterior lid margin and curve away from the globe. The lid margin from anterior to posterior comprises of

Eyelashes.
Grey line (border between anterior (lash, skin and orbicularis oculi muscle) and posterior (tarsal plate and conjunctiva) lamella.
Meibomian gland orifices.
Mucocutaneous junction.
Conjunctiva.

Distichiasis may present only a few isolated eyelashes, or as a complete accessory second row of lashes. These lashes often rub against the cornea and produce irritation of eyes. Unlike distichiasis, occasionally there may be tristichiasis (three rows of cilia) or tetrastichiasis (four rows of cilia).","Symptoms of distichiasis may include

Decrease of vision.
Pain in eyes.
Redness.
Irritation.
Foreign body sensation.
Watering.
Chemosis.
Corneal scarring.
Corneal ulcer.","Distichiasis may be congenital or acquired.
Congenital distichiasis: Congenital distichiasis is almost always associated with lymphoedema distichiasis syndrome (LDS), an autosomal dominant condition that is characterised by two parallel rows of cilia at the eyelid margin and lymphoedema of the extremities. Lymphoedema may present after the age of ten years and may not be noticeable at the time of presentation of distichiasis. Associated abnormalities include entropion, ptosis, cleft lip and palate, webbed neck, vertebral anomalies, and congenital heart defects. Isolated congenital distichiasis is extremely rare.
Acquired distichiasis: Acquired distichiasis is more common than the congenital form. It is seen more often with chronic inflammatory conditions such as blepharitis, staphylococcal hypersensitivity, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), chemical injuries to the eyes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.","Diagnosis depends upon slit-lamp examination by an eye-specialist.
Congenital distichiasis: Examination shows eyelashes exiting posterior to the normal row of lashes. These lashes emerge at or slightly behind the meibomian gland orifices. The aberrant lashes tend to be thinner and shorter than the normal lashes and are often directed posteriorly. These cilia are usually well tolerated during infancy and may not be symptomatic until five years of age.
Acquired distichiasis: Since it is caused by metaplasia of the meibomian glands into hair follicles, variable number of lashes grows from meibomian gland openings. In contrast to congenital distichiasis, the lashes tend to be non-pigmented and stunted, and are usually symptomatic.
Distichiasis may be associated with signs of conjunctival redness and chemosis, epithelial breakdown of cornea, corneal scarring or pannus formation.

Differential diagnosis of distichiasis includes conditions like

Trichiasis: Trichiasis is a condition in which eyelashes from the normal anterior margin are misdirected towards the eye.
Entropion: Entropion is a condition in which the entire eyelid margin turns inward.
Epiblepharon: Epiblepharon is a condition which is seen mostly in children. Here the lashes are not truly misdirected, but are pushed back by the fold of skin against the globe.
Chronic blepharoconjunctivitis.
Cicatricial conjunctivitis.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical therapy
Patients without symptoms or keratopathy do not require any treatment.

Lubricating eye drops and ointment: Lubricating eye drops and ointment may bring about symptomatic relief in patients with epithelial breakdown of the cornea.
Soft contact lenses: Therapeutic soft contact lenses may also be used to protect cornea in cases of corneal epithelial breakdown.


Surgical therapy
Various surgical procedures may be used for the treatment of distichiasis.

Epilation with electrolysis: It is useful in treating small numbers of isolated or focal areas of distichiasis. It may be done under local anaesthesia, but general anaesthesia may be required in children.
Cryosurgery: Cryosurgery may be done to treat wider areas of distichiasis. Cryoprobe freezes the lash follicles and destroys it. Since this approach is non-selective, it may permanently damage the normal anterior eyelashes leading to madarosis (loss of eyelashes). It should be avoided in cases with ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
Laser thermoablation: Laser thermoablation may be used to destroy eyelash follicles.
Radiofrequency ablation: Smallest gauge wire is introduced alongside the lash to the follicle for destruction with radiofrequency.
Lid splitting procedure: This involves an incision in eyelid margin immediately anterior to the distichiatic cilia. The distichiatic lash follicle is treated with direct application of electrolysis, excision, or cryotherapy and then the lid incision is closed.


Prognosis
Prognosis is good if prompt treatment is initiated before permanent damage to the cornea.
Recurrence of distichiatic cilia after surgical intervention may still take place."
Double Elevator Palsy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/double-elevator-palsy,"Double Elevator Palsy refers to limited elevation of one eye in adduction, primary gaze, and abduction. The term double elevator refers to both the elevators of an eye i.e. superior rectus and inferior oblique muscle. However, there are cases in which deficient elevation is produced by tight inferior rectus muscle. Due to this, Double elevator palsy is included under restrictive strabismus. Now Double elevator palsy is known by a more descriptive term as Monocular Elevation Deficit Syndrome (MED).This is distinguished from Brown’s syndrome in which elevation is restricted much more in adduction rather than in abduction.
This condition presents as hypotropia when the patient fixates with normal non-paretic eye. Chin elevation and ptosis/pseudoptosis are often present. Fixation with the paretic eye produces hypertropia of the normal non-paretic eye. Ptosis also disappears since it is not due to paresis of levator palpebrae superioris muscle.
White (1942) described a congenital deficiency of upgaze associated with hypotropia and ptosis of the affected paretic eye. Dunlap (1952) to describe the weakness affecting both elevators of involved eye coined the term Double elevator palsy.
Double elevator palsy may be associated with certain innervational conditions such as

Jaw-winking ptosis
Duane’s retraction syndrome
Other misdirection strabismus syndromes","Symptoms of MED includes

Vertical misalignment of eyes
Profound restriction of elevation across horizontal plane, from adduction to abduction with orthophoria in primary position
Abnormal head posture with chin elevation
Ptosis
Amblyopia
Diplopia","Causes may include congenital and acquired cases.
Congenital cases are characterised by orthotropia or hypotropia in primary position of gaze, true ptosis or pseudoptosis in majority of cases. A large number of cases on forced duction test, show restriction of eyeball in elevation. Jaw movement as in yawning may show paradoxical movements of eyelids (Marcus Gunn phenomenon). Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) may be present. Upward and outward rolling of eyeballs or Bell’s phenomenon is often preserved.
Since elevation is preserved in Bell’s phenomenon, DVD or under anaesthesia, several authors believe it to be a supranuclear disorder. Others discuss it to be a fascicular lesion. Long lasting palsy of superior rectus alone may impede elevation in adduction, thus nuclear origin of superior rectus may be a factor. Even primary fibrotic origin is presumed in cases showing resistance to forced duction test.
Thus supranuclear, nuclear, fascicular and muscular causes are discussed for double elevator palsy.
Cerebrovascular diseases such as hypertension, thromboembolism, and arteritis usually cause acquired cases. Other causes of double elevator palsy include

Infectious disease
Tumours
Sarcoidosis","Diagnosis depends upon history and clinical examination.

History
In congenital MED, history of onset of symptoms and its association with other features is important. The presence of associated amblyopia points to congenital aetiology.
In acquired MED, history of associated neurological features (ataxia, vertigo, tinnitus, loss of consciousness) is important. History of malignancy or cardiovascular disorder is also important.

Clinical examination
Clinical examination distinguishes between MED due to primary superior rectus palsy, any cause of supranuclear superior rectus weakness, or primary/secondary inferior rectus restriction.
Primary superior rectus palsy or paresis: It is characterised by a forced duction test showing no restriction to full upward rotation. Bell’s phenomenon is not present.
Supranuclear superior rectus weakness: This is usually congenital and is characterised by monocular absence of vertical eye movements in superior field of gaze. There is no resistance to upward gaze in forced duction test. Bell’s phenomenon is present.
Patients with primary inferior rectus restriction or fibrosis: This group of patients often do not have hypotropia in primary gaze. Forced duction test shows restriction to upward rotation because of inferior rectus restriction. Superior rectus palsy or supranuclear disorders may produce secondary contracture in inferior rectus. Hypotropia and ptosis are usually present. Forced duction test shows inferior rectus restriction.

Congenital MED

Eyes: Classically MED present with unilateral limitation of upgaze above horizontal midline with accompanying ptosis. Limitation in upgaze is same whether in adduction or abduction. The affected eye is hypotropic. Ptosis is most noticeable when the nonparetic eye fixes and the paretic eye is hypotropic. Pseudoptosis occurs when the eyelid is passively drawn down in hypotropic eye. It resolves when paretic eye takes up fixation. True ptosis does not resolve when paretic eye takes up fixation. In cases with associated ptosis and pseudoptosis together, ptosis improves in part when the paretic eye takes up fixation in primary position.
Head posture: Depending upon degree of binocularity and fixation preference, variable head postures are observed in MED. A patient with hypotropia and having some degree of fusion, usually tilts head back in chin up position to maintain binocularity. Cases with no hypotropia or hypotropic eye is also amblyopic, adopts a normal head posture. Rarely, patient may fixate with affected eye, producing large secondary hypertropia in the nonparetic eye.


Acquired MED

Eyes: It is characterised by acute onset of diplopia in both primary position and upward gaze. Limitation of upgaze is same in both adduction and abduction. Ptosis is usually absent. There may be associated abnormalities of pupil, paresis in downgaze, and convergence weakness. Bell’s phenomenon is usually present unless it is affected by secondary restriction of inferior rectus muscle.
Head position: Often patient assumes chin up position to maintain binocularity and thus decreasing diplopia.


Investigations
Besides regular blood tests, following tests may be done

Chest radiography
Computed tomography
Cerebral angiography
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain stem


Differential diagnosis
Differential diagnosis of congenital MED includes conditions such as

Brown superior oblique syndrome
Congenital fibrosis of inferior rectus muscle
Congenital absence of superior rectus muscle with or without absence of inferior oblique muscle
Vertical Duane co-contraction syndrome
Third cranial nerve palsy with involvement of superior branch
Anomalous insertion of superior or inferior rectus muscle

Differential diagnosis of acquired MED includes conditions such as

Dysthyroid orbitopathy
Myasthenia gravis
Fracture of orbital floor with muscle entrapment
Lesions affecting superior branch of oculomotor nerve
Progressive external ophthalmoplegia
Orbital cellulitis
Orbital inflammatory disease
Systemic amyloidosis with extraocular muscle infiltration
Labyrinthine disorders
Cerebellar tumours","Management is not required in all cases of MED.
Patients with orthophoria in primary position of gaze or with limited changes in head position may be just observed.

Medical therapy

Refractive error correction: Any associated refractive error is corrected
Amblyopia treatment: If amblyopia is noticed in congenital MED, it needs to be treated.


Surgical therapy
Indications for surgery are

Deviation of eyes producing amblyopia and suppression
Vertical deviation in primary position of gaze
Diplopia in primary position of gaze
Contracted binocular fields
Ptosis surgery if significant ptosis persist after strabismus surgery


Surgical procedures
Patient and the family members should be clear that surgery does not cure MED, particularly cases with superior rectus paresis or with supranuclear aetiology. The goal of surgery is to improve position of affected paretic eye in primary position of gaze, to improve binocularity.

Inferior rectus recession with conjunctival recession: Inferior rectus recession with conjunctival recession is done in cases with inferior rectus restriction demonstrated by forced duction test.
Superior rectus resection along with recession of inferior rectus: Patients with large hypotropia in primary position may require superior rectus resection in addition to the usual recession of inferior rectus muscle.
Knapp procedure: It is done in cases with secondary inferior rectus restriction. In these cases, hypotropia persist after inferior rectus recession because of primary superior rectus palsy. Therefore, Knapp procedure is performed in these cases. This procedure involves vertical transposition of the horizontal recti muscles in addition to recession of inferior rectus muscle.
Modified Knapp procedure: In this procedure, partial tendon transposition is done after inferior rectus recession. This is beneficial in cases with lesser hypotropia in primary position.
Posterior fixation suture: This may be done in cases with large hypotropia in primary position of gaze with no inferior rectus restriction.
Superior rectus resection: Patients with small hypotropia with ability of upgaze above midline benefit from superior rectus resection, as an alternative to horizontal rectus transposition.
Ptosis surgery: This surgery may be required after strabismus surgery to decrease residual ptosis."
Digit-Sucking (Thumb/ Finger-Sucking),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/paediatric/digit-sucking-thumb-finger-sucking,"One of the commonest oral habits is sucking, a reflex present at birth. Developing an oral habit is considered a natural phenomenon in children upto a certain age. It is a sign of natural growth and development of a child which stops without any intervention. But, the duration, frequency and intensity of these natural habits, if continue for longer, can alter normal development of oral and facial anatomy. Sucking habits could be nutritive (breast and bottle feeding) or non-nutritive. The commonest form of non-nutritive sucking (NNS) is digit sucking.
The habit of digit-sucking can alter normal occlusion of the child leading to aesthetic and functional discrepancies such as non-aligned eruption of front teeth. Though, digit-sucking is a pacifying and satisfying habit which soothes children but also has ill-effects, especially on dentition.
Definition- 
Repeated and forceful sucking of thumb (digit) with associated strong buccal and lip contractions (Moyers).","Displacement of front teeth leading to proclined upper incisors.
Lower front teeth are tipped back on the lingual side.
Increased length of tooth that is visible in the oral cavity.
Spacing between teeth is also increased (Diastema).
Gap between upper and lower front teeth when closing mouth.
Upper jaw becomes narrow and does not fit properly with the lower jaw.
Speech problems may also occur like difficulty in pronouncing ‘S’.
Physical problems like nail infections, sore digit skin etc.
Incompetent lips closure.
Hyperactive lower lip due to increased movement of facial muscle (Orbicularis Oris).","Digit-sucking starts as a natural part of the development process. It makes babies feel satisfied and may also help them to feel secure and fall asleep.
Miscellaneous causes can be:

Insecurity and stress.
Child-abuse.
Peer relationship and poor performance in school.
Deprivation of love and care by care takers.

Stages of Digit-Sucking
As per Moyers, there are three stages of digit-sucking:
Stage 1- Develops as a part of natural growth process.
Stage 2- Clinically significant and continues up to seven years of age. There may also be need of corrective program.
Stage 3- This causes malocclusion in child and orthodontic treatment may also be required.","History- Frequency, duration and intensity of the digit-sucking is inquired from parents.
Along with this child’s emotional status is also considered.
Extra-oral examination- Redness of digit, short nails, cleaner digit as compared to other digits, shorter upper lip, mouth breathing, enlarged nostrils, rough and deformed digit.
Intra-oral examination- All the clinical features discussed previously are examined.","Psychological therapy-
It consists of counselling of parents to give adequate love, care and affection. Giving rewards and praising child in return of a good behavior.
Child should be motivated by care givers and dentist, if needed.
Child is made conscious about the habit like make the child sit in front of a mirror while exercising digit-sucking habit. Give the child some activity that he/she enjoys which conflicts with the habit of digit-sucking. This way child may learn to stop the habit when done on repetitive basis.
Reminder therapy- 
This therapy is best when child is willing to stop and is more than seven years of age, but cannot do so as the habit is now performed subconsciously. A reminder like,

    Taping the digit may act as first reminder.
    Tightening the bandage on elbow so that child feels it while bending the elbow.
    An appliance (removable or fixed, for example, crib) can help a child to get rid of the habit.

Chemical therapy- 
Covering the digit with a distasteful preparation like pepper solution, quinine and asafoetida will not allow child to put thumb or finger in the mouth.
Mechanical therapy-
Mechanical restraints applied to the hand and digits like splints, adhesives, tapes.
Appliance therapy-
Various orthodontic appliances are employed to break the habit.

    Removable appliances- Tongue spikes, Tongue guards, Spurs.

Fixed appliances- -Quad helix, Hay rakes, Maxillary lingual arch with palatal crib."
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/other-gastro-intestinal/ebola-virus-disease-evd,"Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever(EHF) is one of the viral haemorrhagic fevers which affects a person's blood system
It is a severe, often fatal illness in humans and non human primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees)
It is caused by infection with virus which is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population.
EVD is fatal in, upto- 90% of infected cases .
EVD outbreaks(sudden occurrence of disease) are known to occur primarily in villages of Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests.
The largest outbreak is the ongoing2014 West Africa Ebola Outbreak, which has affected Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone andNigeria.As of August 2014, more than 1,750 cases have been suspected.
Severely infected patients require intensive supportive care. No specific treatment or vaccine is available for this disease.

History
EVD first originated inSudan and theDemocratic Republic of Congo. The disease typically occurs in outbreaks in tropical regions ofSub Saharan Africa. Fewer than 1000 people have been infected every year from 1976 till 2013. Ebola virus was first detected in 1976 during outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever inZaire and Sudan. The name of the disease originates from one of those first recorded outbreaks in 1976 in Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire), which is situated on theEbola River.

Fever
Headache
Weakness
Joint and muscle pain
Diarrhoea
Vomiting
Pain in stomach
Loss of appetite

This disease further progresses to bleeding phase which causes external bleeding from eyes, nose ears as well as bleeding inside the body.
Symptoms may appear from 2 to 21 days after exposure to virus, though 8-10 days is most common period after exposure to Ebola virus.","EVD is caused by four of five viruses in the genus Ebola virus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The four disease-causing viruses in humans are as follows:

Bundibugyo Ebola virus (BDBV)
Zaire Ebola virus/Ebola virus (EBOV)
Sudan Ebola virus (SUDV)
Taï Forest Ebola virus (TAFV)

BDBV,EBOV,SUDV are most dangerous viruses as well responsible for causing large number of outbreaks in Africa.
The fifth virus called Reston Ebola virus (RESTV) is known to cause disease in non human primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees)

Transmission


A.Primary Source of Infection-The virus is transmitted from animals to humans. The virus is zoonotic (animal-borne) with bats being the most likely reservoir of infection.

B. Secondary Source of Infection-The virus can be transmitted from human-to- human through-

Direct contact with the body fluids such as blood, sweat, saliva, semen or other body discharges of an infected person.
Exposure to objects like needles that have been contaminated with infected person.
The dead body of the infected person can also be a source of infection.

Facts about Transmission

Ebola can't be transmitted through air.
It can't be transmitted through water.
It can't be transmitted through food.

This clearly states that it is not a food-borne, water- borne and an air-borne disease.

Risk of Exposure
During the outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are-
a) Health workers.
b) Family and others who are in close contact with of infected individuals.
c) Mourners who come in direct contact with the bodies of the deceased in burial ceremonies.
d) Travellers who visit disease prone areas.","It is difficult to diagnose the disease in early stages of infection as the early symptoms are non specific to Ebola virus infection. However, it can be diagnosed through several lab tests such as-

Antibody-capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Antigen detection tests
Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR)
Virus isolation by cell culture.
Electron microscopy","No vaccine for Ebola Virus Disease is available. Efforts are going on to develop a vaccine. There is no specific treatment for this disease. However, the standard treatment for Ebola virus Disease includes an intensive supportive therapy. This consists of:

balancing the patient’s fluids and electrolytes
maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure
treating them for any other infections

It is very important to provide the treatment/supportive care of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) timely, since it is difficult to diagnose the disease in the early stages of infection. The early symptoms such as headache and fever are nonspecific and can be easily misunderstood for any other disease. The prevention of this disease is a challenging task because it is still not certain as to how people are infected with EHF.
Emergency care set up in India
WHO has declared that the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in west Africa was the “most complex outbreak which has lead to public health emergency”. The government of India has opened a 24 hour 'Emergency Helpline Operation Centre' which provides the most advanced tracking and surveillance system. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi have been identified for management and treatment of individuals with EVD. The helpline numbers are (011)-23061469, 3205 and 1302."
Eczema,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/eczema,"Eczema is often referred to as atopic dermatitis. The term eczema is broadly applied to a range of persistent skin problems.
These symptoms include dryness and skin rashes that are characterized by one or more of symptoms like:

Scratching
Redness
Flaky skin

Atopic dermatitis is also known asinfantile eczema, when it occurs in infants. Infantile eczema may extend into childhood and adolescence and it often involves an oozing, crusting rash mainly on the scalp and face, although it can occur anywhere on the body . The appearance of the rash tends to modify, becoming drier in childhood and then scaly or thickened in adolescence while the itching is persistent.","The patient with atopic dermatitis reacts easily to irritants, food, and environmental allergens and becomes very itchy, leading to:

Redness
Skin edema (swelling)
Itching and dryness
Crusting or cracking
Flaking
Blistering
Oozing or bleeding

It is sometimes also called as ""the itch that rashes"" because the itchiness precedes the rash or scratching the itchy skin may cause the rash.","The exact cause of eczema is unknown/idiopathic but it is caused due to various factors like:
Genetic: There is evidence suggesting that atopic dermatitis is genetically inherited. People of all races can get eczema.
Histamine intolerance: Subsets of people afflicted with atopic dermatitis are affected by exogenous sources of histamine i.e. histamine from outside the body due to which histamine causes itching and discomfort. Certain vegetables like tomatoes, spinach and eggplant naturally contain histamine.
Aggravating factors The following factors leading to worsening symptoms of atopic dermatitis:

Allergies to pollen, mold, dust mites or animals
Cold and dry air in the winter
Colds or flu
Contact irritants and chemicals
Contact with rough materials like wool
Dry skin
Emotional stress
Perfumes or dyes added to lotions or skin soaps
UV light radiation","Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on

History
Symptoms
Physical examination

Endometriosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/reproductive-system/female-gynaecological-diseases-/endometriosis,"Endometriosis is the abnormal growth of cells (endometrial cells) similar to those that form the inside of the uterus, but in a location outside of the uterus.It can grow in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, bladder, bowel, vagina or rectum. 
The uterine cavity is lined with endometrial cells, which are under the influence of female hormones. Endometrial-like cells in areas outside the uterus (endometriosis) are qlso influenced by hormonal changes and respond in a way that is similar to the cells found inside the uterus. Symptoms often worsen with the menstrual cycle. This ""misplaced"" tissue can cause pain, infertility, and very heavy periods. The pain is usually in the abdomen, lower back or pelvic areas. There is no cure for endometriosis, but it can be treated in a variety of ways, including pain medication, hormonal treatments, and surgery.","A major symptom of endometriosis is recurring pelvic pain:

The pain can range from mild to severe cramping that occurs on both sides of the pelvis, in the lower back and rectal area, and pain may even occur during or after sex (dyspareunia)
Intestinal pain
Painful bowel movements or painful urination during menstrual periods
Painful periods or heavy periods
Bleeding between menstrual periods
Infertility
Fatigue
Diarrhea, constipation or nausea, especially during menstrual periods","Retrograde Menstruation: The theory of retrograde menstruation (also called the implantation theory or transplantation theory) is the most widely accepted theory for the formation of ectopic endometrium in endometriosis . It proposes that during a woman's menstrual flow, some of the endometrial debris exits the uterus through the fallopian tubes and attaches itself to the peritoneal surface (the lining of the abdominal cavity) where it can proceed to invade the tissue as endometriosis.
Environmental factors: Another reason for endometriosis is certain toxins in the environment, such as dioxins (chemical byproducts), affecting the body and its immune system.
Genetic factors: Endometriosis is sometimes believed to be heritable i.e. being passed down through the genes of family members. It is more common in Asian women than in white women. This phenomenonsuggests that genes may also play a part.
It can also spread through the bloodstream or lymphatic system:Endometriosis cells are believed to get into the bloodstream or lymphatic system (a network of tubes, glands and organs that is part of the body's defense against infection). This theory could explain how, in very rare cases, the cells are found in remote places such as the eyes or brain.","A medical history and a physical examination can in many patients lead the physician to suspect endometriosis .
Laparoscopy: A surgical procedure where a camera is used to look inside the abdominal cavity, is the gold standard in diagnosis, although it is largely obsolete in most gynecology practices due to its invasive nature.
Ultrasound: Physician can perform an ultrasound, an imaging test to see if there are ovarian cysts from endometriosis.
During a vaginal ultrasound, the doctor will insert a wand-shaped scanner into vagina.
During an ultrasound of pelvis, a scanner is moved across the abdomen.
Both tests use sound waves to make pictures of reproductive organs.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): is another common imaging test that can produce a picture of the inside of the body.
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any treatment and diagnosis purpose you should consult your physician.","While there is no cure for endometriosis, management can be done to ease the symptoms:
Pain medication:For some women with mild symptoms, doctors may suggest taking Non-steriodal anti-inflammtory drugs (NSAIDS)for relieving pain. These include ibuprofen or naproxen (Aleve). When these medicines don't help, doctors may prescribe stronger pain relievers.
Hormonal treatment:When pain medicine is not enough, doctors often recommend hormonal medicines to treat endometriosis. Only women who do not wish to become pregnant can use these drugs. Hormones come in many forms including pill, injection or nasal spray .Health care providers may suggest one of the hormone treatments among Hormone therapy includes oral contraceptives (birth control pills), Progesterone and progestin, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and Danazol.
ac
Surgical treatment:Surgery is generally considered as best choice for women with severe endometriosis. Doctor might suggest one of the following:
Laparoscopyis used to diagnose and treat endometriosis. During the surgery, doctor removes growths and scar tissue or burns it. The aim is to treat the endometriosis without damaging the healthy tissue around it.
Laparotomyis amajor abdominal surgery that involves a much larger cut in the abdomen than with laparoscopy. This allows the doctor to reach and remove growths of endometriosis in the pelvis or abdomen.
Hysterectomyis a surgery in which the doctor removes the uterus. Sometime doctor may remove the ovaries as well to ensure that endometriosis will not return. This is done when the endometriosis has severely damaged other organs. A woman cannot get pregnant after this surgery, so it should only be considered as a last resort.

Epilepsy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/epilepsy,"As per WHO, epilepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent seizures which mayvary from a brief lapse of attention or muscle jerks, to severe and prolonged convulsions.
The seizures are caused by sudden, usually brief, excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells (neurons). In most cases, epilepsy can be successfully treated with anti-epileptic drugs. Epilepsy is a chronic non communicable disorder of the brain that affects people of all ages. WHO statistics shows that around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy. It is very common in India especially in children.","The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are many different types ofseizures, depending on the area of the brain affected. Seizures can be classified into 2categories depending on how much of the brain is affected. There are:

Partial seizures – Where only a small part of the brain is affected

Generalized seizures – Where most or all of the brain is affected. It is more common inchildren.

Symptoms of partial seizure include:

Changes in the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound
An intense feeling that events have happened before (déjà vu)
Tingling sensation, or ‘pins and needles’, in arms and legs
A sudden intense emotion, such as fear or joy
The muscles in arms, legs and face may become stiff
Experience twitching on one side of your body

There are six main types of generalized seizure:

1) Absence seizure: This mainly affect children. It causes the child to lose awareness of hissurroundings for up to 20-30 seconds. The child will seem to stare vacantly into space,though some children might flutter their eyes or smack their lips. The child will have nomemory of the seizure. Absences can occur several times a day. Although they are notdangerous, they may affect the child's performance.

2) Myoclonic jerks: It is types of seizures that cause arms, legs or upper body to jerk ortwitch, much like an electric shock. It often only last for a fraction of a second.Myoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up and can occur incombination with other types of generalized seizures.

3) Clonic seizure: It causes the same sort of twitching as myoclonic jerks, except thesymptoms last longer, normally up to two minutes. The patient may get unconscious

4) Atonic seizure: It cause all muscles to relax, so there is a chance to fall on the ground.Facial injuries are common with this type of seizure.

5) Tonic seizure: Unlike an atonic seizure, tonic seizures cause all the muscles to suddenlybecome stiff. That can result in loss of balance and fall over, so injuries to the back of thehead are common in this type of seizure.

6) Tonic-clonic seizure: It is known as grand mal, has two stages. In this body becomesstiff and then arms and legs begins twitching. Patient loses consciousness. The seizurenormally lasts between one and three minutes, but can last longer.","Exact cause of epilepsy is still unknown but it is thought that it results from excess neuronal firing/activity. Epilepsy is caused when there are disruptions to the normal connections between nerve cells in the brain (much like disruptions in wiring of a complex electrical circuit), when there are imbalances of natural chemicals or neurotransmitters that are important to the signaling among nerve cells, or when there are changes in the membranes of nerve cells, including proteins called ion channels, that alter their normal sensitivity.p
Some of these disruptions, imbalances, and changes may develop early in life, sometimes related to early exposures and events and sometimes related to hereditary factors.
There are three main categories of epilepsy:
Metabolic/ structural epilepsy There is a known cause for a person’s epilepsy, such as a head injury, infections, birth hypoxia etc.
Idiopathic epilepsy – No apparent cause for epilepsy can be found despite investigations.
Epilepsy due to unknown cause like idiopathic epilepsy, no apparent cause can be found. However, there is strong evidence that this type of epilepsy may be the result of brain damage. Status epilepticus: Any seizure lasting for more than 5 minutes is defined as a status epilepticus and the PWE must be rushed to hospital or emergency medication be given as prescribed by the doctor by nose etc, this is a medical emergency.","The diagnosis of epilepsy usually requires that the seizures should occur spontaneously.Other precipitants can trigger an epileptic seizure in patients who otherwise would be susceptible to spontaneous seizures commonest are missing epilepsy medication dose, lack ofsleep, stress, taking certain medication which may precipitate seizures. Rarely certain epilepsy syndromes require particular triggers for seizures to occur. These are termed reflex epilepsy. For example, patients with primary reading epilepsy have seizures triggered by reading Photosensitive epilepsy can be limited to seizures triggered by flashing lights.
Diagnostic methods:
Magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI): An MRI scan can often detect possible causes of epilepsy, such as defects in the structure of your brain or the presence of a brain tumor. For epilepsy, an epilepsy protocol MRI should be done. This test is not painful.
Electroencephalograph (EEG): An EEG test measures the electrical activity of the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. During the test, patient may be asked to breathe deeply or close the eyes, as these actions could reveal unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. Patient might also be asked to look at a flashing light, but the test will be stopped immediately if it looks like the flashing light could trigger a seizure.This test is not painful.
Your diagnosis may vary so it is advisable to consult your physician for further diagnosis.","Epilepsy is usually treated with medication prescribed by a physician; primary caregivers,neurologists, and neurosurgeons all frequently care for people with epilepsy. However, it hasbeen stressed that accurate differentiation between generalized and partial seizures isespecially important in determining the appropriate treatment. The mainstay of treatment ofepilepsy is anti convulsant medications. However many a times it has certain effect on qualityof life.

Medications : The older first-line Anti-epileptic drugs include sodium valproate,carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital. Newer AEDs include lamotrigine,levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topamax, gabapentin, and vigabatrin. Side effectsmay occur and these medicines must be taken under supervision. They must not be stoppedabruptly. There is nothing such as a course for epilepsy and medicines must be regularlyconsumed till the doctor advises.

Surgery : Epilepsy surgery is also done in case of focal seizures that are resistant to thetreatment. Treatment resistance is defined as seizures persisting despite regular medication ofat least 2 anticonvulsants in adequate doses with adequate adherence, provided pseudo seizures havebeen ruled out.

Electrical stimulation: by Vagus Nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation is done butmay not result in complete seizure control.
All persons with epilepsy must carry a seizure frist aid card.

Ectropion,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/ectropion,"Ectropion is an abnormal eversion (outward turning) of the eyelid margin away from globe. Primarily, it involves lower eye lid but upper lid eversion may occur in Floppy eyelid syndrome. Ectropion produces symptoms due to ocular (pertaining to eye) exposure and inadequate lubrication of eyeball. It may cause epiphora, chronic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hypertrophy, exposure keratopathy or even visual loss.
Ectropion may be of following types:-
- Involutional
- Cicatricial
- Paralytic
- Congenital

Mechanical ectropion may occur by displacement of lower eye lid margin by a tumour.","Symptoms are due to irritation of anterior ocular surface, being produced by outward turning of eyelid margin, thereby resulting in exposure of eyeball.
Patient may present with:-
- Lid deformity.
- Foreign body sensation in eye.
- Redness of eyes.
- Tearing/ watering of eyes.
- Eye discharge.
- Pain in eyes.
- Photophobia (intolerance) to light.
- Corneal abrasion.
- Corneal ulceration.
-    Dryness of eyes due to keratinisation.","Causes vary according to the type of ectropion:
Involutional ectropion:
Involutional or senile ectropion is a common form of ectropion. It has many features similar to involutional entropion like it affects the lower lid of elderly patients and the ageing changes for both are similar. Following age related changes contribute to involutional ectropion.
- Horizontal lid laxity leads to excessive eyelid length.
- Tarsoligamentous sling which support the eyelid by attachment to the orbital rim via canthal tendons (both medial and lateral) is lax. Medial and lateral canthal tendons are also known as medial and lateral palpebral ligaments respectively. (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/834932-overview#a6)
- Weakness of pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi.
    Chronic pressure of ocular prosthesis in anophthalmic (absence of eyeball) socket may produce involutional ectropion.
Cicatricial ectropion:
Cicatricial ectropion is caused due to scarring or contracture of skin and underlying tissues. Anterior lamella comprising of skin and orbicularis oculi muscle is shortened. This leads to pulling away of the eyelid from the globe.
Important causes include:-
- Tumours
- Facial burns
- Trauma.
- Excessive skin excision or laser burn in blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery).
Paralytic ectropion:
Paralytic ectropion may occur with palsy of seventh cranial nerve. Paralytic ectropion is caused by decreased tone of orbicularis oculi muscle due to its involvement in seventh cranial nerve palsy.
Important causes of seventh cranial nerve palsy are:-
- Bell palsy.
- Parotid gland infiltration or tumour.
- Cerebellopontine angle mass.
- Herpes zoster oticus.
Congenital ectropion:
Congenital ectropion is a rare bilateral condition. Often the cause is vertical deficiency of anterior lamella.
Congenital ectropion may occur in isolation or may be associated with other conditions such as:-
- Blepharophimosis syndrome.
- Buphthalmos (Enlarged eyeball due to congenital glaucoma).
- Microphthalmos (small eyeball).
- Orbital cyst.
- Down syndrome.
    Mechanical ectropion may occur with lid tumours such as neurofibromas.
Risk factors for Ectropion:
Certain factors contribute in development of ectropion such as:-
- Frequent rubbing of eyelids.
- Repeated pulling of eyelids (e.g. as in contact lens wearer).
- Loss of lid elasticity with ageing.
- Skin conditions involving eyelids.
- Prior eyelid surgery.
- Long term use of eye drops such as dorzolamide and brimodine.
- Inflammatory skin conditions involving eyelids.
- Trauma.
- Midfacial hypoplasia.","Diagnosis depends upon elucidation of causative factors and clinical examination.
Examination may show features like:-
- Signs of skin scarring, irritation or infection.
- In hypoplastic midface, inferior orbital margin is located posteriorly relative to the globe.
- Eversion of eyelid.
- Examination of lid margin structures may show madarosis (absence or loss of eye lashes), chronic blepharitis, ulceration or infiltration.
- In punctal ectropion, punctum may rotate away with medial laxity and no longer make contact with ocular surface.
- Conjunctival examination may show dry eye features due to keratinisation induced by chronic irritation, hypertrophy or scarring.
- Cornea may show abrasion, scarring, thinning, neovascularisation or ulceration.
Involutional Ectropion:
- Patient may show horizontal laxity of medial and/or lateral canthal tendons.
- Horizontal lid laxity: Horizontal lid laxity may be assessed by placing the thumb beneath lateral canthus and pushing the eyelid laterally and superiorly. Involutional ectropion disappears with this manoeuvre.
- Eyelid distraction test: Eyelid distraction test is done by pulling the lid away from the globe. Normal lid distraction is between 2-3mm. In horizontal lid laxity, distraction is more than 5mm.
- Snap back test: Examiner pulls lower lid inferiorly and observe the lid returning to its original position without allowing patient to blink. Normally, lid returns back quickly without blinking, but in increased laxity, blink may be needed for its return to normal position.
Cicatricial ectropion:
- Horizontal lid laxity: Horizontal lid laxity may be assessed by placing the thumb beneath lateral canthus and pushing the eyelid laterally and superiorly. If the lower lid margin does not extend 2mm above the lower limbus, then cicatricial ectropion is considered.
- In cicatricial ectropion, eyelid malposition often becomes accentuated by asking the patient to look upward and open mouth at the same time. By this manoeuvre, anterior lamella is maximally stretched.
Paralytic ectropion: 
- Signs of seventh cranial nerve palsy such as weakness of facial muscles, disparity between spontaneous and voluntary closure of eyelid, presence or absence of Bell phenomenon and inability to close the eyelids may be present.
- Exposure keratopathy caused by incomplete blinking and lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids).
- Epiphora produced by failure of lacrimal pump mechanism and increase in tear production due to corneal exposure.
- Eyelid retraction.
- Deformity such as brow ptosis.
Congenital ectropion:
- Congenital ectropion may show features of associated disease such as Blepharophimosis syndrome, microphthalmos (small eyeball) or Down syndrome.
    Mechanical ectropion will show features of associated tumour.
Ectropion should be differentiated from conditions like:-
- Eyelid retraction secondary to proptosis.
-    Eyelid malignancy e.g. basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.","Management should be under medical supervision.
Medical management:
Medical treatment may be needed in:-
- Patient who decline surgery.
- As temporising measure until patient can have surgery.
- Patient is too sick for surgical intervention.
- Patient who may improve spontaneously e.g. patients with ectropion induced by long term use of eye drops may resolve with discontinuation or patients suffering from inflammatory skin conditions involving eyelid may have improvement or reversal of ectropion on improvement of inflammation.
Medical non-invasive management may involve:-
- Lubrication of the ocular surface: Lubrication and moisture shields are helpful in corneal exposure. Lubricating ointment may be used in keratinised conjunctiva.
- Horizontal taping of the eyelid: Taping the lateral canthal skin superotemporally provides temporary relief in patients with new onset seventh cranial nerve palsy.
- Patients with early punctal ectropion should wipe the eyelids in a direction up and in (toward the nose) to avoid worsening of medial ectropion.
- In cicatricial ectropion, digital massage may help in stretching the scar.
Surgical management:
Involutional ectropion:
- Medial ectropion may be corrected by Cautery puncture, conjunctivoplasty or lazy-T procedure.
- Extensive ectropion is corrected by Bick procedure or modified Kunht-Szymanowski procedure.
Cicatricial ectropion:
- Cicatricial ectropion is corrected by excision of scar and skin grafting.
Paralytic ectropion:
- Relief may be provided with tarsorrhaphy or canthoplasty.
Congenital ectropion:
- Severe cases may be treated with full-thickness skin graft to replace vertical skin defect.
    Mechanical ectropion may require excision of tumour."
Entropion,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/entropion,"Entropion is an abnormality resulting in inversion (inward turning) of the eyelid margin. Entropion causes irritation to the exposed surface of the eyeball. Entropion can damage conjunctival and corneal surface which may lead to corneal abrasion, scarring, corneal thinning or neovascularisation. Advanced cases may develop corneal ulceration or even perforation.
Entropion may be of following main types:-
- Involutional
- Cicatricial
- Acute spastic
- Congenital
Though entropion can affect all ages, this is more common in older adults.
Involutional entropion patients are often elderly people and may be having significant comorbities (two or more diseases existing together).","Symptoms are due to irritation of anterior ocular (pertaining to eye) surface, being produced by inward turning of eyelid margin.
Patient may present with:-
- Foreign body sensation in eye.
- Irritation of eyes due to pseudotrichiasis (inward turned eyelashes due to entropion).
- Redness of eyes.
- Tearing/ watering of eyes.
- Eye discharge.
- Pain in eyes.
- Photophobia (intolerance) to light.
- Corneal abrasion.
- Corneal ulceration.
- Symblepharon (adhesion of eyelids to the eyeball).
- Loss of normal eyelid margin structures e.g. madarosis (absence or loss of eye lashes).
- Dryness of eyes due to keratinisation.","Involutional Entropion:
Involutional or senile entropion is the most common type and affects lower lid only. Following age related changes contribute to involutional entropion.
- Overriding of pre-septal over the pre-tarsal part of orbicularis oculi muscle, during closure of eyelids. This moves the lower border of the tarsus away from the globe and the upper border toward the globe.
- Horizontal lid laxity produced by thinning and atrophy of the tarsus and the canthal tendons. Due to this laxity, middle part of lower lid when pulled away from the globe does not snap back to its normal position.
- Weakness of the lower lid retractors which can be assessed clinically by decreased excursion of the lower lid in down-gaze.
- Involution of the soft tissues of the orbit, particularly fat, may cause enophthalmos (deep seated eyes), which in turn lead to unstable eyelid position and entropion.
Cicatricial Entropion:
Cicatricial entropion is usually due to scarring of palpebral conjunctiva, which pull lid margin towards the eyeball. It is usually secondary to systemic and progressive inflammatory conditions.
Conditions which may lead to cicatricial entropion are:-
- Trachoma.
- Chemical burns of conjunctiva.
- Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
- Trauma.
- Iatrogenic (induced inadvertently by medical professionals) e.g. following surgery, radiation therapy or use of chemotherapeutic drugs.
Acute Spastic Entropion:
Acute spastic entropion is produced due to spasm of orbicularis oculi muscle.
It may be:-
- Due to ocular irritation caused by infection, inflammation as in blepharitis, or trauma.
- Iatrogenic e.g. produced by surgical trauma.
- Essential blepharospasm.
Congenital Entropion:
True congenital entropion is rare.
It may be caused by:-
- Improper development of retractor aponeurosis insertion into the inferior border of the tarsal plate.
- Paucity of tissue may be present vertically in the posterior lamella of the eyelid.
- Tarsal kink syndrome produced by structural defects in the tarsal plate.
- Facial paralysis in children (unlike facial paralysis in adults which lead to ectropion).
Mechanism of entropion:
Lower lid is stabilised by orbicularis oculi muscle, tarsus, lower lid retractors and canthal tendons.
- Horizontal lid stability: Horizontal lid stability is provided by canthal tendons and tarsal plate. Loosening of horizontal tension leads to lid margin rotation.
- Vertical lid stability: Lower lid retractors provide vertical stability. Involutional entropion causes increased distance between lower lid retractors and inferior border of tarsal plate. Loosening of these vertical stabilising structure leads to inward lid rotation.
- Overriding of preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle: Lower lid retractors have fine extensions to orbicularis oculi muscle and to the overlying skin. Preseptal part overrides the pretarsal part of orbicularis oculi muscle due to weakness or dehiscence of the connections.This rotates eyelid margin against the globe.
- Orbital fat: Decrease in orbital fat content due to ageing or trauma causes enophthalmos, which increases space between eyelid and the eyeball. This produces lower lid laxity and greater orbicularis override.","Diagnosis depends upon elucidation of causative factors and clinical examination.
Examination may show features like:-
- Facial spasm, signs of skin irritation or infection.
- Pseudotrichiasis.
- Examination of lid margin structures may show madarosis.
- Conjunctival examination may show dry eye features due to keratinisation induced by chronic irritation, symblepharon formation or forniceal (singular- fornix, where palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva meet) shortening.
- Cornea may show abrasion, scarring, thinning, neovascularisation or ulceration.
Involutional Entropion:
- Patient may show horizontal laxity of medial and/or lateral canthal tendons.
- Snap back test: Examiner pulls lower lid down and observes the lid returning to its original position without allowing patient to blink. Normally, lid returns back quickly without blinking, but in increased laxity, blink may be needed for its return to normal position. The examiner can also pull the lower lid anteriorly away from the globe. In involutional entropion, lid may be pulled away by 6-15mm from the globe, as compared to 2-3mm only in normal lid.
- Lower lid retractor function: This is evaluated by measuring lower lid excursion in downward gaze. Lower lid retractors cause 3-4mm inferior movement of lower lid margin in downgaze. This movement is absent or decreased in lower lid weakness, dehiscence or disinsertion.
- Eyelid eversion: In involutional entropion, lid can be everted easily.
Cicatricial entropion:
- Conjunctival scar: Patients usually display scarring of conjunctiva.
- Lid traction: There is resistance to traction and persistence of entropion on horizontal lid traction.
- Eyelid eversion: Unlike involutional entropion, eyelid eversion is difficult.
Acute spastic entropion:
- In acute spastic entropion, forceful closure of eyelids may lead to overriding of preseptal over the pretarsal part of orbicularis oculi muscle.
Congenital entropion:
- Congenital entropion shows inward turning of entire lower eyelid and lashes.
- There is absence of lower lid crease.
Entropion must be differentiated from conditions like:
- Trichiasis: Trichiasis is an acquired posterior misdirection of previously normal eye lashes. There is no inversion of the eyelid margin.
- Congenital distichiasis: In congenital distichiasis, there is partial or complete second row of eye lashes growing out of or slightly behind the meibomian gland orifices. Eye lashes in this condition are thinner, shorter and less pigmented than normal cilia (eye lashes).
- Acquired metaplastic eye lashes: Acquired metaplastic eye lashes may occur in late stages of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, trachoma and chemical burns. In this, eye lashes exit near the meibomian gland orifices and are associated with other changes such as keratinisation of the conjunctiva.
Congenital epiblepharon: Congenital entropion should be distinguished from more common congenital epiblepharon. Epiblepharon shows an extra horizontal fold of skin which stretches across the lid margin. The eye lashes may be turned upward, particularly medially. These may touch the cornea but they rarely cause discomfort in the eye. Pulling down the lid differentiates these conditions. In epiblepharon, the lashes turn out and the normal position of lid margin becomes visible. In congenital entropion, the entire eyelid is pulled away from the eyeball.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical management:
Medical treatment may be needed in:-
- Patient who decline surgery.
- As temporising measure until patient can have surgery.
- Patient is too sick for surgical intervention.
- Patient who may improve spontaneously.
Medical non-invasive management may involve:-
- Taping of lower eye lid to malar (cheekbone) eminence.
- Application of cyanoacrylate liquid bandage to evert the eye lid.
- Botulinum toxin injection to the orbicularis oculi muscle may weaken it and help in prevention of override.
- Use of lubricating artificial tear preparations to protect ocular surface.

In spastic entropion, measures for blepharitis like lid hygiene, use of antibiotics and steroids may be useful in management.
Surgical management:
Involutional entropion:
- Various surgical procedures may be done e.g. application of cautery, lid rotational sutures, shortening of lower lid retractors, Wies and Fox procedure.
Cicatricial entropion:
- Mild cases may be treated by tarsal fracture and severe cases may be treated with mucous membrane grafts.
Acute spastic entropion:
- Eyelid everting sutures may be applied.
Congenital entropion:
-    Tarsal fixation suture may prevent corneal damage."
Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/epidemic-keratoconjunctivitis,"Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a highly contagious viral conjunctivitis caused by a group of viruses known as adenoviruses. Adenovirus serotypes 8, 19 and 37 are often associated with EKC. Family of adenoviruses contain different serotypes that can also cause pharyngoconjunctival fever, non-specific sporadic follicular conjunctivitis and chronic papillary conjunctivitis. In addition to infections of ocular (pertaining to eye) surface, adenovirus (mainly those responsible for paryngoconjunctival fever) is responsible for causing infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. EKC is reported worldwide and has a tendency to occur in epidemics.
More than half of cases may show symptoms, though milder, in other eye.
It is one of the most common causes of acute conjunctivitis, with clinical features such as sudden onset of acute follicular conjunctivitis, watering of eyes, chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), redness and ipsilateral (same side) pre-auricular (in front of ear) lymphadenopathy.
Development of keratitis (corneal inflammation) distinguishes EKC from other forms of conjunctivitis and it usually arises after fourth day of initial onset of symptoms. Corneal involvement ranges from diffuse, fine superficial keratitis to epithelial defects to sub-epithelial infiltrates. Sub-epithelial infiltrates can persist for years, which may cause glare and reduction in visual acuity.
Epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis may also develop membranous or pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis in severe cases, which may lead to scarring of conjunctiva and symblepharon (adhesion between eyelid and eyeball) formation.
EKC is usually a self-limiting disease and it tends to resolve spontaneously within 1-3 weeks without leaving any significant complications. Diagnosis of the disease process is clinical and the treatment is mostly symptomatic. Antiviral and cyclosporine eye drops were tried in some patients, but there was no definite benefit of these. Mild topical steroids may be used in cases with severe membranous conjunctivitis. Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), along with low-dose mitomycin C (MMC), may be used to remove sub-epithelial opacities.","Symptoms of EKC may begin following an eye examination and spread in a clinic, exposure within the family or at work.
The incubation period of the disease is 2-14 days, and the person may remain infectious for 10-14 days after the onset of symptoms.
EKC may be preceded by systemic features such as:
- Fever.
- Headache.
- Body fatigue.
- Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes, specifically pre-auricular)
- Respiratory symptoms.
- General malaise.
- Myalgia.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Diarrhoea.

Ocular features of EKC:
Symptoms tend to last for 7-21 days. More than half the cases show involvement of fellow eye within 7 days of onset. The signs and symptoms are less severe in the fellow eye.
In more severe cases, patient may present with ocular and peri-orbital pain and diminution of vision.
Ocular symptoms are mainly:
- Redness of eyes.
- Irritation.
- Itching.
- Foreign body sensation.
- Epiphora (watering of eyes).
- Pain.
- Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva).
- Photophobia (increased light sensitivity).
- Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage (haemorrhage below conjunctiva).
- Blurring or diminution of vision.
- Swelling of lids.
- Pseudomembranes on conjunctiva.","EKC is caused by adenoviruses and more than 50 serotypes have been isolated. There are at-least 19 documented serotypes which causes EKC. Most commonly associated serotypes include adenovirus 8, 19 and 37. Less commonly, EKC may be caused by serotypes 2 to 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 21 and 29.
Because of prevalence of low natural immunity against adenovirus being present in general population, every individual is considered to be susceptible to infection.
EKC is more common in adults, but it can infect all age groups.
Adenovirus can be recovered from eye and throat even up to 14 days, after the onset of clinical symptoms.
EKC epidemics usually take place in closed institutions like schools, camps, nursing homes, hospitals or places of work.
Possible modes of transmission are:
- Direct contact with eye secretions: Direct contact with eye secretions is a major mode of transmission.
- Spread by air droplets.
- Possible exposure through swimming pools.
- Iatrogenic (spread by treating people in clinics).

Objects that come into contact with eyes (such as cosmetics) should not be shared or allowed to come in contact with others.

Many epidemics of EKC started in ophthalmology out-patient clinics by direct contact with contaminated diagnostic instruments.
Reasons for infectious transmission of EKC in hospitals and clinics include:
- Virus is resistant to standard disinfectants (70% isopropyl alcohol and ammonia).
- Virus sheds from eye 3 days before and 14 days after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, this fact should be taken into consideration for allowing a patient to return to work or school.
- Adenovirus serotype 19 remains viable for 5 weeks.

Adenovirus is the main causative agent being isolated from patients suffering from viral conjunctivitis.","Diagnosis of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis usually depends upon the characteristic clinical features. 
Viral cultures and conjunctival cytological studies are the means of identifying and confirming epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.
Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis infection is preceded by flu-like general symptoms.
Ocular presentation is like features of any conjunctivitis with associated keratitis.
Ipsilateral pre-auricular lymphadenopathy is one of the classic features of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.
Decreased visual acuity is rarely present except in cases with corneal involvement.
Ocular features:
Slit-lamp examination by an eye specialist is required for diagnosis.
Eyelids:
- Swelling of eyelids.
- Erythema (redness) of eyelids.
Conjunctiva:
- Conjunctival hyperaemia (redness of conjunctiva).
- Chemosis (conjunctival swelling).
- Follicular reaction, mainly in lower palpebral (eyelid) conjunctiva (earliest and most common sign).
- Papillary hypertrophy.
- Subconjunctival and petechial (small red or purple spot caused by bleeding) haemorrhage.
- Membranous or pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis.
- Conjunctival scarring.
- Symblepharon formation which may restrict eye movement.
Cornea:
One of the distinguishing features of EKC from other viral conjunctivitis is involvement of cornea, which is usually mild and transient.
There is no change in sensation of cornea.
- Diffuse, fine epithelial keratitis: Diffuse, fine epithelial keratitis develops 3-4 days after the onset of symptoms and it may persist for 2-3 weeks. Keratitis stains with fluorescein and rose Bengal stain. Keratitis may lead to frank corneal epithelial defect.
- Focal epithelial keratitis: Focal epithelial keratitis may develop one week after the onset of symptoms and it may persist for 1-2 weeks. This is characterised by central ulceration and irregular borders with grey-white dots. These epithelial changes are related to active viral disease.
- Sub-epithelial infiltrates: Sub-epithelial infiltrates beneath focal epithelial lesions may develop about 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms and may persist for weeks to years. These are immunologic in nature and may resolve spontaneously, usually without scarring. Transient mild anterior uveitis may accompany this.
- Disciform keratitis: Disciform keratitis may develop rarely.
Uveal tissue:
- Anterior uveitis: Transient mild anterior uveitis may occur rarely.
Laboratory diagnosis:
Following tests may be used for diagnosis of EKC:
- Polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR assay):
- Fluorescent antibody test:
- Complement fixation test:
- Giemsa cytology: Giemsa cytology is microscopic examination of stained conjunctival scrapings for intranuclear inclusions and lymphocytes.
- Cell culture:
- Enzyme immune assays:
- AdenoPlus test: AdenoPlus test, an enhanced device for Rapid Pathogen Screening (RPS), is an antigen-based immunoassay. This test detects the presence of adenoviral particles and thus allows patient a speedier return to school or work when the virus is no longer detectable. Ability to confirm adenoviral infection may allow the study and use of novel therapies for the disease.

PCR test is more sensitive test, and therefore, use of AdenoPlus test should be limited to diagnostically challenging patients.
EKC should be differentiated from conditions such as:
- Trachoma.
- Adult inclusion conjunctivitis.
- Herpes simplex infection.
- Allergic conjunctivitis.
- Acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis.
- Bacterial conjunctivitis.
- Viral conjunctivitis.
- Complications of contact lens use.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
EKC is usually a self-limiting disease and it tends to resolve spontaneously within 1-3 weeks without leaving any significant complications. There is no effective treatment for EKC.
Depending upon the severity of signs and symptoms, patients are followed up for several days to weeks.
Goals of pharmacotherapy (treatment with medicines) are to reduce morbidity and to prevent any complications.

Supportive medical management of EKC includes:
- Cold compresses.
- Artificial tears: Artificial tears stabilise and thicken pre-corneal tear film and prolong tear film break-up time (BUT), which occurs with dry eye.
- Topical vasoconstrictor/antihistamine: Topical vasoconstrictor/antihistamine may be used for severe itching. On discontinuation, it may cause rebound (recurrence) of symptoms.
- Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) may be used to reduce inflammation.
- Topical antibiotic: Topical antibiotic may be used to prevent superadded bacterial infection.
- Cycloplegic agents: Cycloplegic agents may be used for severe photophobia.
- Mild topical corticosteroids: Mild topical corticosteroids may be used in severe membranous conjunctivitis or patients with marked reduction in vision due to late sub-epithelial opacities. While corticosteroids do assist in reducing inflammation, they do not have any significant impact on natural course of the disease. Taper this treatment slowly to avoid recurrence of corneal opacities. Any patient on topical corticosteroid should be observed for side effects such as glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure) and formation of cataract.
- Topical immune-suppressants (e.g.Tacrolimus ointment): Topical immune-suppressants can inhibit autoimmune inflammatory responses. Tacrolimus is a treatment option for sub-epithelial infiltrates in EKC. Tacrolimus suppresses cellular immunity.
- Ophthalmic antiseptics (e.g.Povidone-iodine): Ophthalmic antiseptics are broad-spectrum germicidal agents. Povidone-iodine has broad antibacterial and antiviral activity. Povidone iodine may be used to reduce the duration of disease.

Surgical management:
Surgery is extremely rare for EKC and is reserved for severe cases with cicatricial conjunctivitis or symblepharon.
If surgery is necessary, it is mainly in the form of:
- Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), along with low-dose mitomycin, may be used to remove sub-epithelial opacities.
- Membrane or pseudo-membrane removal: Membrane or pseudo-membrane may be peeled off gently and a topical corticosteroid may be prescribed.
- Fornix reconstruction.
- Entropion repair.

Prognosis:
Most cases of EKC are acute, benign and self-limiting. Infection usually resolves spontaneously within 2-3 weeks. Sub-epithelial infiltrates may last for months together and may decrease vision if visual axis is involved."
Epibulbar Dermoids,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/epibulbar-dermoids,"Epibulbar dermoids are benign congenital tumours that contain choristomatous tissue (choristomas are congenital overgrowth of normal tissue in abnormal locations). Most frequent site for epibulbar dermoid is inferior-temporal part of limbus (junction between cornea and conjunctiva). Occasionally, dermoid may be present entirely within cornea or may be localised to conjunctiva. Choristomas consist of ectodermal and mesodermal tissues in varying proportion and may contain epidermal appendages, skin, sweat gland, connective tissue, muscle, tooth, fat, lacrimal gland, bone, cartilage, vascular or neurologic tissue.
There are three broad categories of dermoids depending upon the location:
Limbal: Limbal dermoid straddles the limbus and is the most common type. Limbal dermoids are superficial usually, but may affect deeper structures as well.
Corneal: This includes dermoid which involves superficial cornea only. This spares the limbus, descemet membrane and endothelium.
Anterior segment: This group includes dermoid which involves the entire anterior segment. Dermoid replaces cornea with a dermolipoma or lipodermoid that may involve iris, ciliary body and the lens.
Lipodermoids consists of adipose tissue with surrounding dermis-like connective tissue. Lipodermoids are soft, yellow, movable subconjunctival masses located commonly at the limbus or outer canthus.","Epibulbar dermoids are present at birth but may be recognised during first or second decade of life. These appear to enlarge as a person matures.
Dermoids may enlarge slowly, especially at puberty or due to irritation or trauma. Enlarging dermoid may produce amblyopia (lazy eye with lack of development of vision not related to eye health problem) if it produces significant corneal astigmatism (refractive optical defect in which sharp focus is not formed on retina) or it blocks visual axis.
Most of the patients present before the age of 16 years and may have symptoms such as:
- Decreased or poor vision.
- Foreign body sensation in eye.
- Enlarging ocular mass.
- Cosmetic disfigurement.","Most of the cases of epibulbar dermoids are sporadic and no relation is found with any known toxin or irritant.
Several theories are proposed to explain development of epibulbar dermoids:-
- One such theory suggests an early developmental error causing metaplastic transformation of the mesoblast between rim of optic nerve and the surface ectoderm.
- Another mechanism suggests sequestration of pluripotent cells during embryonic development of the surrounding ocular structures.
Epibulbar dermoids are generally not inherited except for few exceptions.
Goldenhar syndrome (oculo-auriculo-vertebral dysplasia): In Goldenhar syndrome, there is familial presentation with multi-factorial pattern of inheritance of limbal dermoids in association with systemic disorders.
Two rare forms of dermoids, annular limbal and corneal dystrophy form present in multiple family members.","Diagnosis of dermoid depends upon the clinical presentation.
Dermoids are dome shaped, fleshy and may have fine superficial blood vessels. Dermoids may appear keratinised and may show hair follicles and cilia.
Dermoid is usually single, unilateral pink-white-grey mass, one to five mm in size. Most of the epibulbar dermoids are present at the inferior-temporal part of the limbus. Clinical picture is highly variable. These may be multiple, bilateral, minutely small or big enough to obscure the cornea.
Rarely, dermoids may be localised to cornea or the bulbar conjunctiva only.
Dermoids may show associated ocular abnormalities such as:-
- Lid coloboma (full-thickness defect of the lid).
- Iris and choroidal coloboma.
- Aniridia (absence of iris).
- Microphthalmia (small eyeball).
- Duane retraction syndrome and other ocular motility disorders.
- Lacrimal duct stenosis.
- Staphyloma (protrusion) of cornea and sclera.
Associated systemic abnormalities may be:
- Goldenhar syndrome: In Goldenhar syndrome, limbal dermoids are associated with pre-auricular appendages and auricular fistulae. Other abnormalities include hemi-facial/ craniofacial microsomia (lower half of one side of face is underdeveloped), microtia (pinna or external ear is poorly developed) and vertebral anomalies (such as fused cervical vertebrae, hemi-vertebrae, spina bifida, lumbosacral anomalies and occipitalisation of first cervical Atlas vertebra). Epibulbar dermoid straddles the limbus in the infero-temporal quadrant. It is bilateral in about 25% of cases. A subconjunctival lipodermoid may be present in supero-temporal quadrant in about 50% of cases. This lipodermoid may blend with epibulbar dermoid.
Facial malformations include macrostomia (unusually wide mouth), micrognathia (small jaw), dental abnormalities and facial asymmetry.
There may be associated systemic abnormalities involving cardiovascular, renal, genitourinary and gastrointestinal systems.
- SCALP syndrome: Acronym SCALP includes rare clinical findings such as Naevus Sebaceous (benign neoplasm occurring mainly on scalp and face), Central nervous system malformations, Aplasia cutis congenita (absence of a portion of skin in a localised or widespread area at birth), Limbal dermoid and Pigmented naevus.

Epibulbar dermoids should be differentiated from:
- Foreign body granuloma.
- Staphyloma.
- Haemangioma.
- Sclerocornea.
- Corneal scar due to trauma or infection.
- Atypical pterygium (wing like triangular sheet on bulbar conjunctiva).
Imaging studies:
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI may be useful in distinguishing lesions extending into conjunctival fornix or lateral canthus (junction between lower and upper eyelid) and entangling with orbital fat and extra-ocular muscles.
Histological findings:
Epibulbar dermoids have choristomatous tissue which includes epidermal appendages, adipose tissue, lacrimal gland tissue, smooth and striated muscle, nervous tissue, tooth, bone and cartilage. It may also have lymphoid nodules and vascular elements. The surface of dermoids consists of corneal or conjunctival epithelium.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Management may include:
Medical therapy:
- Lubricating drops and ointments: Lubricating drops and ointments help to prevent foreign body sensation.
- Periodic removal of irritating cilia.
Surgical Therapy:
Surgical therapy is the mainstay of treatment and is indicated for:
- Interference with vision.
- Significant cosmetic disfigurement.

Surgery is done only when the risk of subsequent scar formation or other complications is outweighed by the benefits of vision improvement and cosmetic appearance.
Attempts at complete removal of epibulbar dermoid are unnecessary. The lesion may extend into deeper structures of the eye and the risk of perforation increases if attempts are made to remove the lesion completely.
Procedure of choice for removal of epibulbar dermoid is:
- Superficial sclero-keratectomy: In superficial sclero-keratectomy, epibulbar dermoid is removed flushed with the surface of eyeball.
After sclero-keratectomy, exposed area may be covered by:
- Conjunctival flap: The exposed sclera should be covered by relaxing adjacent conjunctiva and sewing it to the defect.
- Lamellar keratoplasty is done to cover deep excision of cornea.
- Amniotic membrane graft: Single or multi-layered amniotic membrane graft may be used to cover large patches of bare sclera. It may be secured by sutures or fibrin glue."
Epidemic dropsy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/epidemic-dropsy,"Epidemic dropsy is an acute non-infectious disease resulting from use of edible oils adulterated with Argemone mexicana (mexican poppy) seed oils. It occurs as an epidemic (unusual occurrence of disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area) form in places where mustard oil is commonly used as cooking mediums as in North, North-Western and North- Eastern states of India, generally sparing South Indian states where the predominant cooking oil is coconut oil. In Western Rajasthan, India a small outbreak was reported from consumption of contaminated sesame seeds oil with Argemone Mexicana. 
Epidemic dropsy was first reported by Lyon in 1877 from Calcutta, India and since then outbreaks/cases were reported from West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Rajasthan and Punjab.
The epidemic in1998 at New Delhi was the large outbreak in which over 60 persons lost their lives and more than 3000 victims were hospitalized. Even after that the epidemics occurred at Gwalior (2000), Kannauj (2002) and Lucknow (2005), Panchmahal and Dungarpur (2012) districts of India. Usually, epidemics in India have been reported between July and September, but because of enforcement of law and public awareness the mode of presentation has changed from an epidemic to a sporadic pattern.
The main symptom of epidemic dropsy consists of bilateral swelling of legs often associated with erythema, diarrhea, dyspnoea, glaucoma. Persons of all ages and both sexes were affected except breastfed infants and small children who have no mustard oil in their diets.
Epidemic dropsy has been also reported from Fiji Islands, Madagascar, Mauritius and Cape Districts of South Africa. All outbreaks were related to the intake of mustard oil contaminated with argemone oil except in the South African epidemic which occurred because of consumption of wheat flour adulterated with argemone seeds.
The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has made “The Food Safety and Standards (packaging and labelling) regulations” 2011*, according to this every container of refined vegetable oil should carry the label “free from Argemone Oil” along with other specifications mentioned under FSSAI.","The disease is mostly reported in epidemic form but sporadic cases were also reported. Both sexes were involved equally. Persons of all ages were affected except breastfed infants and small children who have no mustard oil in their diets.

Onset is usually insidious with watery diarrhoea and vomiting. This may last from a few days to more than a week.
Intermittent or continuous fever, ranging from 99°F to 100.5°F, usually not high grade
Joint pains, muscular pains, and low backache.
Bilateral pitting oedema of the lower limbs extending from the ankles up to the scrotum and abdominal wall.
Oedema increases after standing, typically reaching a maximum at the end of the day and decreasing on lying down.
Erythema and skin tenderness.
Cough and breathlessness, initially on exertion, later on breathlessness may be present at rest and on lying down when cardiac failure develops.
Hepatomegaly (enlargement of liver).
Eyes: fundus examination shows dilated, torturous vessels and superficial retinal haemorrhages. Bilateral (both eyes) glaucoma occurs in some cases (raised intra ocular pressure with normal chamber depth, no aqueous outflow obstruction, no sign of anterior segment inflammation).
Pulmonary oedema, pericardial effusion, cardiac failure.","Epidemic dropsy is a clinical state caused by consuming the edible oil adulterated with Argemone mexicana seed oil that is a native plant of the West Indies, and grows wild in India. It has prickly leaves and bright yellow flowers. In India it is popularly known as Satyanashi.
Seeds of Argemone mexicana are black in colour and closely resemble mustard seeds. Crops of mustard oil are matured during March and at the same time seeds of argemone also mature hence there may be accidental mixing of both seeds. However intentional mixing of Argemone mexicana oil with mustard oil by unscrupulous traders can lead to large scale outbreaks.
Toxic effects of argemone oil are because of two physiologically active (benzophenanthridine) alkaloids-sanguinarine and dihydro-sanguinarine. Sanguinarine interferes with the oxidation of pyruvic acid that accumulates in the blood.
The outbreaks of epidemic dropsy occur usually in months of May to September in India because newly extracted oil is sold during these months in the market. Massage with contaminated mustard oil has also been reported to cause epidemic dropsy.","The diagnosis of epidemic dropsy may be considered during an outbreak of bilateral tender pitting leg oedema in more than one member of a family or community. It should be distinguished from hypoproteinaemic states, filariasis, venous insufficiency, Beriberi, hypothyroidism and nephrotic syndrome. Presence of sanguinarine in blood and urine confirms the diagnosis for epidemic dropsy.

Blood examination: may show anaemia and pancytopenia, raised plasma pyruvate levels and presence of sanguinarine.
Liver function tests: are usually normal.
Kidney function tests: blood urea and creatinine may be raised if renal failure is present. Hypoalbuminaemia, raised alpha-2 globulin and reversal of albumin: globulin ratio may be found in some cases.
Urinalysis: is usually normal but sanguinarine may be present.
Chest X-ray: may show cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema or pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram: may show nonspecific ST segment, and T-wave changes or atrial or ventricular extrasystoles.

Detection of argemone seed with mustard seed:

Adulteration of light-yellow mustard seeds (Brassica dompestris) by argemone seeds can be visually detected. However, argemone seeds are more similar in colour to the dark mustard seeds (Brassica nigra), and are thus less easily detected. Magnifying lens can be used for identification.
The specific gravity of argemone seeds is 1.03 compared to 1.3 for mustard seeds. Hence, in normal saline solution, the mustard oil seeds settle at the bottom while argemone seeds remain suspended.
Mustard seeds have smooth surface. The argemone seeds have grainy and rough surface and can be separated out by close examination. When mustard seed is pressed inside it is yellow while for argemone seeds it is white.

Detection of argemone oil adulteration in edible oils:

Nitric acid test: Nitric acid is added to the sample of oil in a test tube. The test tube is shaken and development of yellow, orange-yellow or crimson colour shows the presence of argemone oil. The test is positive only when the concentration of argemone oil is &gt;0.25%.
Paper chromatographic method: It is the most sensitive method; can detect argemone oil up to 0.0001% in edible oil.","No specific treatment is there for the epidemic dropsy.

Initial step is the withdrawal of contaminated oil.
Bed rest with leg elevation and a protein rich diet.
Supplements of calcium, antioxidants (vitamin C and E) and thiamine and other B vitamins are commonly used.
Diuretics may be used but caution must be exercised not to deplete the intravascular volume unless features of frank congestive cardiac failure are present (as oedema is mainly due to increased capillary permeability).
If pneumonia is there, it is treated with appropriate antibiotics.
Cases with renal failure may need dialysis therapy.
Glaucoma generally responds to medical treatment but may need operative intervention.
Cardiac failure can be managed by bed rest, oxygen supplementation, diuretics, salt restriction and fluid restriction."
Epiblepharon,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/epiblepharon,"Epiblepharon is the presence of a fold in skin and orbicularis oculi muscle of the lower eyelids which may cause eyelashes to rub against the cornea (trichiasis). There is vertical orientation of the eyelashes. It may be associated with weakness of inferior oblique muscle. It usually affects nasal one-third of the lower lid and is usually bilateral. There may be presence of coexistent entropion. This condition may be seen in upper eyelid as well. This condition may be autosomal dominant or sporadic and is usually common in Asian population. Epiblepharon may be self-limiting in many patients, since it decreases or diminishes with facial growth. The word epi means on and blepharos means eyelid. 
Epiblepharon is mostly a paediatric condition, but it is often reported in adults as well. Acquired epiblepharon has been reported in thyroid eye disease and other conditions of proptosis.
Epiblepharon may be identified by the extra eyelid fold in lower eyelid and it resolves when the pressure of the fold is taken away from the lower eyelid.","About 80% of children with epiblepharon have no ocular complaints.
Some patients show symptoms at all times, whereas others are symptomatic only in down gaze.
Epiblepharon may present with symptoms such as

Watering or epiphora.
Discharge.
Foreign body sensation.
Redness.
Corneal epithelial defect.
Photophobia.
Itching.
Rubbing of eyes.
Frequent blinking.","Epiblepharon may be associated with several causes such as

Poor development of the eyelid retractors.
Failure of retractors to gain access to skin.
Hypertrophy of orbicularis oculi muscle.
Insertion of pre-tarsal part of orbicularis oculi muscle close to the eyelid margin with weak attachment of orbicularis oculi muscle and skin to underlying tarsus.

These underlying processes may result in pre-tarsal orbicularis muscle and eyelid skin that overrides the eyelid margin, thereby causing inward rotation of cilia.
In case of thyroid related proptosis causing acquired epiblepharon, the aetiology is felt to be increased intra-orbital pressure leading to an overriding anterior lamella of lid.","Epiblepharon is diagnosed based on clinical features.
Epiblepharon is typically bilateral and it generally affects medial part of lower eyelids.
Symptoms range from none to features of eye irritation. The severity of epiblepharon symptoms may be associated with the type and number of eyelashes irritating the eyes. Few and fine eyelashes are often less symptomatic than thick and plentiful lashes. Due to this variability, symptoms of epiblepharon may change with age. Child may develop decreased visual acuity due to development of induced astigmatism.
Classification
Khwarg and Lee (1997) proposed a grading scale for severity of lower eyelid epiblepharon based on height of the skin-fold, area of corneal touch by cilia, and area of corneal erosion.

Differential diagnosis
Epiblepharon may be differentiated from

Congenital entropion: It is characterised by an in-turning of the eyelid margin. Congenital entropion does not improve over the time and surgical correction is usually required.
Trichiasis: Trichiasisis an acquired condition characterised by posterior misdirection of previously normal eye lashes. The misdirected lashes may be diffuse involving the entire lid (diffuse trichiasis) or may involve a small segment of it (simple trichiasis).
Distichiasis: Distichiasis is characterised by an extra row of eyelashes emanating from the meibomian gland orifices. Like epiblepharon, eyelid margin is in its normal position.
Epicanthus: Epicanthus may result similar appearing fold of skin close to the eyelid margin. An associated semicircular epicanthal fold may contribute to additional medial canthal tension and worsens epiblepharon.
Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction: If epiphora persists after treatment of epiblepharon, congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction should be considered.
Allergic conjunctivitis: Allergic conjunctivitis may also be considered in cases of chronic bilateral eye irritation, watering, and redness of eyes.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical therapy
Epiblepharon may be managed conservatively unless there are issues related to eyelash contact with ocular surface or there are concerns about refractive amblyopia.

Lubricating artificial tears: Lubricating artificial tears may be used as soothing agents. Even in the presence of corneal irritation, some children do not have any complaint.
Hyaluronic acid: Hyaluronic acid injection into sub-orbicularis muscle space has been described as an effective temporising approach until self-correction takes place with age.

Some cases of epiblepharon resolve spontaneously as the nasal bridge grows.

Surgical therapy
Surgical intervention is required in cases of corneal keratopathy and it involve procedures such as

Eyelid everting sutures: A non-incisional approach involves placement of eyelid everting sutures. This procedure is associated with a high recurrence rate.
Excision of orbicularis oculi muscle and skin: In this procedure, redundant skin and orbicularis oculi muscle is excised in the form of a spindle. This procedure is associated with formation of scar tissue.
Transconjunctival approach: An effective transconjunctival approach (Wladis, 2014) has been described with low recurrence rate and no external scar.

Occasionally, mucous membrane graft to the posterior tarsus and lid margin may be required to cover the raw surfaces.

Prognosis
Prognosis of epiblepharon once corrected is good, and it usually does not recur."
Epicanthus,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/epicanthus,"Epicanthus or epicanthal fold is a semi-lunar fold of skin at medial canthus, with its concavity facing outward. The epicanthal fold obscures the view of the medial canthus including caruncle and plica semilunaris. This is the most common congenital lid condition. Epicanthus may be an isolated phenomenon or it may be an associated feature in patients with congenital ptosis (drooping of eyelids), Down’s syndrome or blepharophimosis (shortening of palpebral fissure both horizontally and vertically) syndrome. This condition may be unilateral or bilateral and is most prominent along the upper lid. Although, it is a normal finding in people of Asian ancestry, but is abnormal in non-Asians.
Epicanthus gives rise to the appearance of pseudostrabismus (present as pseudoesotropia). This condition does not pose any problem to the eye. However, it produces parental concern because of its resemblance to pseudoesotropia. Gentle stretch of the soft tissues of the nasal bridge reduces appearance of epicanthus at the medial canthus and reveals normal alignment of the eyes. Cover and cross-cover test reveals orthophoria (normal alignment of eyes).
Depending on the origin and configuration of free fold, there are at least four distinct types of epicanthus such as

Epicanthus supraciliaris.
Epicanthus palpebralis.
Epicanthus tarsalis.
Epicanthus inversus.

Epicanthus generally disappears by the age of puberty as the nasal bridge grows. Epicanthus inversus is usually seen in association with blepharophimosis and may be associated with relative shortage of skin in lateral periorbital area.
Epiblepharon, a related condition seen more frequently in Asians, occurs when a skin fold runs the entire length of the lower eyelid just below the eyelashes, causing them to turn inward, leading to irritation of eyes.","Parents usually bring the child with features such as

Cosmetic appearance due to epicanthal fold.
Suspected strabismus or squint (pseudoesotropia).
Obscuration of visual axis especially when eye is turned medially.
Associated ptosis (drooping of eyelids).","Epicanthus mainly results from a relative deficiency of skin in the vertical axis (as opposed to the horizontal axis) within the medial canthal area. It may occur alone or in association with other abnormalities such as

Telecanthus (Increased distance between two medial canthi with normal interpupillary distance).
Ptosis of eyelids.
Telecanthus and Ptosis together as in blepharophimosis syndrome.
Avulsion of medial canthus following trauma.
Iatrogenic (induced inadvertently by physician) as in abnormally high or curved dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) incision.
As a part of congenital syndrome e.g. Down’s syndrome.

Epicanthus may be a normal feature in Asians.","Diagnosis is clinical and depends on the origin and configuration of the free fold.

Epicanthus supraciliaris: It occurs when the free fold originates from the midpoint of the eyebrow and runs down on the side of nostril, ending over the anterior lacrimal crest. It obscures medial canthus and caruncle.
Epicanthus palpebralis: It is similar to epicanthus supraciliaris, except for the fact that the fold originates lower in the tarsal region of the upper eyelid, and runs down over the medial canthal region, ending at the region of the anterior lacrimal crest.
Epicanthus tarsalis: This occurs normally in Asians, with the epicanthal fold running along the length of the upper eyelid, obscuring the roots of the eyelashes, and ending with a curl in the medial canthus. It may not obscure the medial canthal structures and the caruncle.
Epicanthus inversus: It is a distinct and occurs when the fold arises in the lower eyelid at the midpupillary area and runs upward, obscuring the medial canthal angle and ending in the upper eyelid, which may or may not be affected. Instead of ellipse, the shape of the palpebral fissure is quadrangular.

Amblyopia is rare in association with epicanthus and is usually associated with other problems, such as anisometropia and astigmatism.
No spinal abnormalities are reported from patients in spite of compensatory head tilt from blepharoptosis.

Differential diagnosis

Epiblepharon

Syndromes associated with epicanthal folds such as blepharophimosis syndrome and Down’s syndrome should be looked for. Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is characterised by tetrad of blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Most cases do not require treatment and resolve as the child grows.
Surgical therapy 
Rarely is surgery recommended for simple epicanthus since it normally resolves spontaneously as the nasal bridge and mid-face develops. Pseudostrabismus resolves as well along with this.
Surgical therapy requires correction of abnormal skin fold resulting from mal-distribution of skin within medial canthus, hypertrophy or kinking of the orbicularis oculi muscle fibers within the medial canthus (orbital portion lying over the medial canthal tendon rather than nasal to it), and possibly, an abnormal attachment of the medial horn of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle aponeurosis into the anterior part of medial canthal tendon.
Repair should never be considered before the age of five years, to allow for spontaneous regression. One should consider the option to wait until the child reaches to the age of puberty. Asians should never be rushed into epicanthus repair until they understand the ramifications of a non-reversible procedure that reflect on their heritage. Surgery may be conducted under local or general anaesthesia depending upon the age of the patient. The surgical procedures are

Spaeth’s inverted ‘V’ operation: This procedure may be used for mild degrees of epicanthus, since it is simple and effective.
Roveda’s procedure: Roveda’s five flap technique gives excellent results in patients with broad epicanthal folds.
Verwey’s ‘Y-V’ operation: This procedure is helpful in patients with moderate epicanthus.
Mustardé double Z-plasty: This procedure is adopted for the most complex cases since it is the least satisfactory technique for correction of epicanthus.
Pang’s eyelid crease procedure: This is an eyelid crease procedure used to produce full-thickness fibrous tracts in the lids. This creates an adhesion between the superior tarsal border and the skin. This procedure may be used to revise level of the crease after ptosis surgery especially when the creases are asymmetric. This operation is also used as cosmetic operation to ‘westernise’ the Asian eyelids.


Prognosis
Majority of children of Asian ancestry lose their folds during and after puberty.
Surgical correction is successful in majority of cases of epicanthus."
Euryblepharon,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/euryblepharon,"Euryblepharon is characterised by increased vertical separation of the temporal aspect of the palpebral fissure so that the palpebral conjunctiva is not in apposition with the eye. The enlargement of palpebral fissure is accompanied by variable degree of lower eyelid ectropion. The lower eyelid ectropion is caused by vertical shortening of the lower eyelid relative to the horizontal dimensions of the opposing upper eyelid. In euryblepharon, palpebral apertures are larger than normal and it may be associated with epicanthus. Widening of palpebral fissure may give the appearance of eyelid ptosis. The eyelids are normally developed but the insertions of the canthal tendons appear to be widely or anteriorly placed. Frequently, the palpebral fissure has downward slant as well because of an inferiorly displaced attachment of the lateral canthal tendon.
Euryblepharon is present at birth and there is no other associated primary ocular abnormality. In contrast, secondary enlargement of the palpebral aperture may accompany a variety of ocular abnormalities.
This condition was first described by Desmarres (1854). The average length of the lid fissures at different ages is given by Duke-Elder and Cook (1963). It increases from 18.35 mm. at birth to 29.68 mm. at 24 to 26 years of age. One half of this increase occurs in the first 4 years of life. The length is slightly less for females.","Euryblepharon may be unilateral or bilateral. It may present with

Enlargement of horizontal palpebral apertures.
Elongated lid margins.
Downward and lateral displacement of outer canthus.
Lateral ectropion.
Lagophthalmos.
Watering or epiphora.
Reduced blink rate.
Exposure keratopathy.","Euryblepharon may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder or may occur sporadically.
A variety of systemic conditions may be associated such as

Kabuki syndrome: Kabuki syndrome, described in 1981, is an idiopathic multisystem disorder characterised by characteristic facial features, short stature, mental retardation, and skeletal abnormalities. This is a clinical diagnosis of uncertain aetiology. Most cases are sporadic, but multiple familial cases suggest autosomal dominant inheritance. Clinical features include euryblepharon, depressed nasal tip, prominent cupped ears and arched eyebrows. Other ocular abnormalities may also be present. Systemic abnormalities include cleft lip/palate, kidney or urinary tract anomalies, and cardiovascular disorders.
Blepharo-cheilo-dontic (BCD) syndrome: This congenital condition is characterised by euryblepharon with ectropion of the lower eyelids, cleft lip/palate, and dental anomalies (oligodontia and conical teeth). Other ocular abnormalities reported with this disorder are lagophthalmos, ectropion, distichiasis, and ocular hypertelorism (widely apart orbits).
Down syndrome.","Diagnosis of euryblepharon is based on clinical features.
Euryblepharon presents with

Bilateral symmetrical enlargement of the horizontal palpebral apertures.
Elongated lid margins. The horizontal palpebral fissure length is increased to approximately 35 mm. from the average length of 28- 30 mm.
Vertical shortening of eyelid skin.
Downward and lateral displacement of outer canthi.
There is lateral ectropion, reduced blink rate, lagophthalmos, with exposure keratopathy. There may be epiphora due to exposure and reduced blink rate.


Differential diagnosis
Euryblepharon may be distinguished from conditions such as

Congenital ectropion: Congenital ectropion also has vertical shortening of eyelid skin, but there is no elongation of lid margin.
Lower lid ptosis.
Other causes of epiphora.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Most of the cases do not require any treatment. The condition may cease to be apparent with facial growth.
Medical therapy
Mild cases may be managed conservatively by medical means.

Topical lubricant artificial tears: Topical lubricant artificial tears may be used to prevent ocular irritation.


Surgical therapy
Moderate degrees of euryblepharon may require surgical therapy to protect the cornea. It may involve procedures like

Lateral tarsorrhaphy: Lateral tarsorrhaphy (joining of upper and lower eyelids) may be required for symptomatic cases.
Lateral canthoplasty with shortening of the upper and lower eyelids laterally.
Re-suspension of lateral canthus: Re-suspension of lateral canthus using lateral tarsal strip may be done in severe cases of euryblepharon causing epiphora or exposure keratopathy.
Augmentation of posterior lamella and anterior skin graft, for severe forms of vertical eyelid shortening.


Prognosis
Prognosis of euryblepharon may be excellent if necessary surgery for eyelid mal-position is performed to protect ocular surface."
Ectopic pregnancy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/ectopic-pregnancy,"Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of maternal death in early pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancyis defined as implantation of a fertilized egg outside the uterine cavity. In a normal pregnancy, the fertilized egg moves from the fallopian tube into the uterus, where the pregnancy develops. In a small percentage of pregnancies, however, the embryo implants in extra uterine locations leading to an ectopic pregnancy. Most extra uterine pregnancies (97%) implant in the fallopian tube; another 3% of ectopic pregnancies implant in the cervix, ovary, peritoneal cavity, or in uterine scars. In ectopic pregnancy as the pregnancy continues, it can cause the tube to rupture with internal bleeding. This situation can be life threatening and needs to be treated as medical emergency.
Many risk factors like pelvic inflammatory disease, intrauterine device, tubal surgeries, sexually transmitted diseases, infertility are associated with ectopic pregnancy.
The incidence of ectopic pregnancy among all pregnancies is about 0.25-2.0% worldwide* and can occur in any sexually active woman of reproductive age. Ectopic pregnancy was reported in 0.91% of pregnant women (with no maternal deaths) in a study done at tertiary care centre in South India.**
Globally the incidence of ectopic pregnancy has been on the rise over the past few decades because of increased incidence of salpingitis (infection of fallopian tubes mostly due to sexually transmitted infections), induction of ovulation, and tubal surgeries; and improved ability to detect ectopic pregnancy. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy has risen from 4.5 cases per 1,000 pregnancies in 1970 to 19.7 cases per 1,000 pregnancies in 1992 in North America. Though the cases of ectopic pregnancy are on rise; the incidence of rupture of ectopic pregnancy and maternal deaths has declined because of early diagnosis and management. Ectopic pregnancy still accounts for 4% to 10% of pregnancy-related deaths and leads to a high incidence of ectopic site gestations in subsequent pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancy accounts for 3.5-7.1% of maternal deaths in India.**
Suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy in women of reproductive age group presenting with lower abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding with timely case management can prevent the maternal deaths and future fertility problems in women.","It is important to be aware of the symptoms of ectopic pregnancy because it can occur in any sexually active woman whether or not she is using contraceptives or has undergone tubal sterilization (""tying the tubes"").
Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are different in each woman. Sometimes ectopic pregnancy may be asymptomatic or women may not be aware about the pregnancy (if her menstrual periods are irregular previously or pregnancy is due to failure of contraception).
Most women get symptoms in the 6th week of pregnancy (about 2 weeks after the missed period). The most common symptoms are unilateral lower abdominal pain, a short period of amenorrhoea, and slight vaginal bleeding.
Ectopic pregnancy may cause the following symptoms:

Vaginal bleeding often occurs (but not always). It is mostly different to the bleeding of a normal period. It may start about the time a period is due or about few weeks after the missed period. The bleeding may be heavier or lighter than a normal period. The blood may look darker.
Abdominal or pelvic pain is felt in lower abdomen; it develops suddenly for no apparent reason or may come on gradually over several days. Pain can be sudden and sharp without relief or seems to come and go. It may occur on only one side.

(These symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific and are also associated with other pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage).
Other less common symptoms include:

Shoulder pain can be felt because of collection of blood from ruptured tube into the abdomen under the diaphragm. Pain may be worse during lying down.
Women may feel weakness, dizziness, or fainting because of blood loss; if the fallopian tube ruptures and causes internal bleeding.
In rare instances, collapse may be the first sign of an ectopic pregnancy. This is an emergency situation and should seek urgent medical attention.
Urinary symptoms.
Rectal pressure or pain on defecation.","An ectopic pregnancy is mostly occurs in fallopian tube. A fertilized egg has difficulty passing through a damaged tube, causing the egg to implant and grow in the tube. Adnexal infections or tubal surgery can damage the fallopian tubes. Therefore women who have abnormal fallopian tubes are at higher risk of ectopic pregnancy.
Most of the ectopic pregnancies (97%) occur in ampullary part of the fallopian tube. Another 3% of ectopic pregnancies implant in the cervix, ovary, peritoneal cavity, isthmic, or interstitial portion of the fallopian tube, or in uterine scars.
Risk factors- Several factors may increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy:

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): It is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and nearby pelvic structures and may be due to sexually transmitted infections.
Previous ectopic pregnancy: There is increased risk of ectopic pregnancy with previous ectopic pregnancy because it reflects the underlying tubal pathology which is almost always bilateral. Previous ectopic pregnancy becomes a more significant risk factor with each successive occurrence. The average rate of repeat ectopic pregnancies after one ectopic pregnancy is 12%.
Pelvic or abdominal surgery
Prior tubal surgery (such as tubal sterilization)
Endometriosis- Endometriosis, tubal surgery and pelvic surgery result in pelvic and tubal adhesions and abnormal tubal function.
Infertility and infertility treatment
Intrauterine devices (IUD): It prevents intrauterine pregnancy but not tubal and ovarian pregnancy.

Other factors that increase a woman’s risk of ectopic pregnancy include the following

Cigarette smoking- Cigarette smoking is known to affect ciliary action within the fallopian tubes.
Exposure to the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during her mother’s pregnancy: (DES) is associated with uterotubal anomalies.
Increased age

Heterotopic pregnancyis a rare situation when there is an intra-uterine and extra-uterine pregnancy occurring simultaneously.","The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is not always easy; and a delay in diagnosis and treatment can have serious consequences. Early diagnosis can be made before appearance of sign and symptoms.
The possibility of ectopic pregnancy should be excluded in women of child bearing age, even in the absence of risk factors (such as previous ectopic pregnancy, PID), because about a third of women with an ectopic pregnancy have no known risk factors. Clinical suspicion is the key to identifying women who need prompt and careful evaluation.
The symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy can resemble the common symptoms and signs of other conditions such as gastrointestinal conditions or urinary tract infection.
A detailed history, clinical examination and various tests help in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy. 
(a) History- A proper history and physical examination are the initial steps for initiating an appropriate work-up that will result in the accurate and timely diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy.

Abdominal pain with spotting, usually occurring six to eight weeks after the last normal menstrual period is the common symptoms of tubal pregnancy in symptomatic patients. Other presentations depend on the location of the ectopic pregnancy.
Less commonly ectopic pregnancy presents with pain radiating to the shoulder, vaginal bleeding, syncope and/ or signs of hypovolemic shock.
Findings such as hypotension and marked abdominal tenderness with guarding and rebound tenderness suggest a leaking or ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

(b)Speculum and bimanual examination have a limited diagnostic value and findings may be nonspecific. Findings include:

Slightly enlarged and soft uterus (enlargement of the uterus is less than expected for apregnancy duration)
Presence of uterine or cervical motion tenderness
An adnexal mass may be palpated on one side
Uterine contents may be present in the vagina, due to shedding of endometrial lining stimulated by an ectopic pregnancy

(c) Pregnancy test- A urine pregnancy test is positive in ectopic pregnancy.
(d)Ultrasonography-It is the most important tool for diagnosing an extrauterine pregnancy.

Transvaginal ultrasonography, or endovaginal ultrasonography, can be used to visualize an intrauterine pregnancy by 24 days post ovulation or 38 days after the last menstrual period (about 1 week earlier than transabdominal ultrasonography).
Visualization of an intrauterine sac, with or without fetal cardiac activity, is often adequate to exclude ectopic pregnancy.
On endovaginal ultrasonographic scan, absence of an intrauterine pregnancy (or an empty uterus) with a serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) greater than discriminatory cut-off value may be an ectopic pregnancy or a recent abortion.
Ultrasound is also an essential tool in the diagnosis of non-tubal ectopic pregnancies.

Color-flow Doppler Ultrasonography may be helpful in cases in which a gestational sac is doubtful or absent.
(e)Test to detect serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) - b-hCG is predictable during the early weeks of a normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP). This is usually checked every 48 hours because, with a pregnancy in the uterus, the hormone level rises by 63% every 48 hours (known as the ‘doubling time’) whereas, with ectopic pregnancies, the levels are usually lower and rise more slowly or stay the same. b-hCG level less than 1,500 mIU/mL is predictive for ectopic pregnancy.
The b-hCG level is more useful in distinguishing abnormal from normal pregnancies than it is for distinguishing ectopic from intrauterine pregnancies.
(f) Laparoscopy-It is indicated for patients who are hemodynamically unstable with multiple signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy.
The combination of sensitive urinary pregnancy tests, transvaginal ultrasound and serum hCG estimations enables the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.","In order to minimize the risks to woman’s health/or to the save the woman’s life treatment of ectopic pregnancy is necessary. Options of treatment depend on duration of pregnancy, clinical condition, fertility status, scan results and level of b-hCG.
Various treatment options are-
(a) Expectant management: The term expectant management is usually defined as watchful waiting or close monitoring by a physician instead of immediate treatment. In expectant management, no treatment is given and the patient is followed closely with weekly transvaginal ultrasonography and weekly blood measurements of b-hCG until the level is less than10 mIU/mL. Expectant management may be advised when:

An ultrasound scan shows a small ectopic pregnancy with no bleeding into the abdomen, low, declining β-hCG values and patient is willing to come for close follow-up. 
An ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but clinically fails to show an ectopic pregnancy.

(b) Medication- Sometimes drug (systemic methotrexate) is used for the treatment of very early stages of ectopic pregnancy, when tube is not ruptured. The drug stops the further development of the pregnancy and it is gradually reabsorbed by the body leaving the fallopian tube intact.

Success rates of medical treatment vary (65-95%) depending on the circumstances in which methotrexate is given.
Follow up visits for few weeks are required to ensure the pregnancy has completely ended.
A reliable contraception should be used for at least 3 months.

(c) Surgery- Surgical management is performing an operation to remove the ectopic pregnancy and it is the most established form of treatment. Surgery may also be performed if expectant management or medical management has failed.
An ectopic pregnancy can be removed from the fallopian tube by using two types of surgical procedures called salpingostomy and salpingectomy. These procedures can be performed by either Laparoscopy or Laparotomy.

Laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) -An advantage of laparoscopic surgery is that the operation is less invasive, thus recovery time is quicker and less painful as compared to a laparotomy.
Laparotomy (open surgery) is usually done when there is heavy internal bleeding/rupture or presence of previous scar tissue and in an emergency situation.

Salpingostomy- If rupture has not occurred; the products of conception are removed through a small length wise incision in the fallopian tube (linear salpingostomy). There is a very small risk that some of the products of pregnancy may remain in the tube after salpingostomy. Therefore patient is advised to have weekly blood tests to monitor hCG levels and decreased levels of hCG shows that the pregnancy is fully resolved.
Salpingectomy- If the tube has already ruptured or damaged as a result of an ectopic pregnancy, salpingectomy is performed to remove the damaged fallopian tube. In this procedure a segment of fallopian tube is removed. The remaining healthy fallopian tube may be reconnected. Salpingectomy is appropriate for women who have a healthy contralateral tube.
Total salpingectomy is done in a patient who has completed childbearing and no longer desires fertility.
Tissue removed at the time of surgery can be sent for testing in the laboratory if facilities are there.
Future fertility-

The chances of having a successful pregnancy in the future are good. If only one fallopian tube is present, chances of conceiving are only slightly reduced.
Women who have had a previous ectopic pregnancy are at higher risk of reoccurrence.
Salpingostomy and salpingectomy have the same effect on future fertility of the women when one healthy fallopian tube is present.
Salpingostomy may be preferred; if other tube is damaged. This may improve the chances ofgetting pregnantin the future.
Laparoscopy and medical therapy have now emerged as the widely used therapeutic procedures with great success in terms of reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stay and conservation of fertility.

Rh (rhesus) factor-
All pregnant women (including ectopic pregnancies) who are Rh-negative (determined by a blood test) should receive Rh immunoglobulin (antibodies directed against the Rh)."
Exposure Keratopathy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/exposure-keratopathy,"Exposure keratopathy refers to that surface disorder of the eye in which absence of an adequate tear film results in breakdown of the corneal epithelium. This may produce disruption of corneal epithelium, ulcer formation, superadded infection, thinning and even perforation of eyes in severe cases.
Exposure keratopathy is broadly divided into two main categories viz.

Exposure due to primary or secondary corneal anaesthesia or hypoaesthesia: Corneal sensation plays an important role in the maintenance of healthy corneal epithelium. It is presumed that nerve growth factors released by corneal nerves mediate epithelial cell proliferation. Thus, corneal anaesthesia results in a surface which is more vulnerable to injury, delayed healing of corneal epithelium, and progressive keratopathy. Reduced corneal sensation may be congenital or acquired, and may be complete or partial.
Exposure produced by mechanical eyelid abnormalities such as lagophthalmos: Lagophthalmos is the inability to close eyelids completely. Lagophthalmos may be divided into three main groups e.g. Proptosis causing excessive ocular surface exposure, palpebral (eyelid) insufficiency secondary to physiologic, congenital or acquired conditions, and idiopathic lagophthalmos. Lagophthalmos with or without exposure keratopathy may be present at night in some healthy individuals (nocturnal lagophthalmos).


Exposure of cornea from any cause may lead to thickening, xerosis (dryness), and scarring of epidermis.","Exposure keratopathy may produce symptoms such as

Irritation of eyes.
Foreign body sensation.
Burning.
Blurring of vision.
Watering.
Redness.
Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light).
Corneal vascularisation.
Corneal ulceration.","Exposure keratopathy has numerous causes such as
I. Neurotrophic 

Fifth intracranial nerve palsy.
Cerebro-vascular accident.
Aneurysm.
Tumours.
Herpes simplex.
Herpes zoster.
Multiple sclerosis.

II. Neuroparalytic

Intracranial seventh nerve palsy.

III. Malposition of lids

Lagophthalmos.
Proptosis.","Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and evaluation.
Clinical history: To determine the aetiology, history should elucidate any recent trauma, surgery, or any infection. History of Bell’s palsy should be taken. A family history of corneal anaesthesia or lagophthalmos should be elicited.
Clinical examination: The position of eyelids in a relaxed open and closed position as well as inter-palpebral distance should be assessed. Appositional closure of the eyelids with each blink should be recorded. Slit-lamp examination may be done to exclude any obscure lagophthalmos. Obscure lagophthalmos may be due to when the upper and lower eyelashes meet, preventing complete closure of the lids, or obscures view of the true eyelid position. The upper eyelid may also overhang the lower lid, giving the appearance of total closure, however, eyelid margins may not oppose. Bell’s phenomenon should be recorded.
Conjunctiva is examined for any areas of scarring or cicatrisation.
Corneal sensations are evaluated by using wisp of cotton or an aesthesiometer.
Staining with Fluorescein sodium dye may reveal any punctuate epithelial erosions, frank epithelial defects, or ulceration.
A complete neurological examination is also conducted including assessment of cranial nerves.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Management of exposure keratopathy depends upon underlying aetiology i.e. whether the disease is primarily related to corneal anaesthesia or lagophthalmos.
I. Corneal anaesthesia: In these cases, the mainstay of treatment is lubrication with

Preservative-free artificial tears.
Eye ointment at night.

Other treatment includes

Bandage contact lenses: Short term use of bandage contact lenses may be effective in promoting healing by epithelial cell migration and adhesion to the stroma.
Anti-inflammatory agents: Agents such as corticosteroids must be used with caution since they may precipitate stromal lysis and perforation.
Tetracyclines: These may be effective in cases of stromal necrosis.
Autologous serum: It is a valuable adjunt in the treatment of neurotrophic keratopathy and persistent corneal epithelial defects.
Punctal occlusion: Punctal occlusion with punctal plugs or cauterisation of the puncta may be helpful.
Tarsorrhaphy: Partial stitching of the eyelids together to protect cornea.
Amniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane act as basement membrane scaffold upon which epithelium may migrate and adhere.
Cyanoacrylate glue: Cyanoacrylate glue may be applied with a bandage contact lens for the treatment of small corneal perforations.
Lamellar/penetrating keratoplasty: Lamellar/penetrating keratoplasty may be required for larger perforations.



II. Lagophthalmos:
Mild epitheliopathy: The following treatment is given if there is no ulceration and only mild epitheliopathy is present. It includes

Preservative-free artificial tears.
Lubricating ointment at night.

Moderate to severe corneal involvement but no ulceration: In these cases, expected duration of lagophthalmos is important.

If lagophthalmos is expected for six weeks: Management includes patching of eyes with ointment or temporary tarsorrhaphy.
If lagophthalmos is expected for longer than six weeks: Management includes permanent tarsorrhaphy, gold lid weight surgery, recession of levator palpebrae superioris muscle, or full thickness graft, depending upon the aetiology.

Lower eyelid lagophthalmos may be treated with lateral tarsal strip or lower lid spacing graft."
Eyelid Varix,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/eyelid-varix,"Eyelid Varix is an abnormal dilatation of one or more normal blood vessels. Varices of the eyelids are usually an extension forward of the orbital varices into the eyelid. These probably are congenital or acquired weakness of the affected vein, or to an obstruction of the venous circulation.
Varices may result due to

An arteriovenous malformation
Compression by an arterial aneurysm or a tumour
Infection
Trauma involving wall or lumen, of the vein

Varices resulting from infection or trauma may get thrombosed.","Eyelid varix may present with symptoms such as

Soft brown or blue lesion which increases with increase in venous pressure
Organised thrombus may show haemosiderin and calcification
Ruptured varix may show haemorrhage and lid ecchymosis
Haemorrhage in deep associated orbital varix may present with acute pain, proptosis and restriction of ocular movements.","Eyelid varix is caused probably due to congenital or acquired weakness of the involved vein, or due to obstruction of the venous circulation.
Eyelid varices may result due to

An arteriovenous malformation
Compression by an arterial aneurysm or a tumour
Infection
Trauma involving wall or lumen of the vein","Diagnosis of eyelid varix is clinical.
Eyelid varix is a well defined soft dark blue or brown lesion without any associated palpable thrill or bruit. The lesion increases in size with any activity which raises venous pressure such as Valsalva manoeuvre.
Some cases with organised thrombus may be associated with haemosiderin deposition or dystrophic calcification. The lesion is firm in consistency and less compressible in thrombosed lesions. Varices may get ruptured with minor trauma, resulting in haemorrhage and lid ecchymosis.
In cases with orbital extension, deep haemorrhage may result in onset of acute pain, proptosis and restriction of ocular movements.
Pathology
Grossly, eyelid varix lies anterior to septum. Deep orbital varix may produce proptosis.
Microscopically, varix shows dilated vascular channels, filled with clotted blood and focal thrombosis. There may be phlebolith formation.
Investigations
CT scan: Since most of eyelid varices may have orbital extension, a CT scan may be needed in those with orbital clinical signs.

Differential diagnosis
It includes

Capillary haemangioma
Cavernous haemangioma
Arteriovenous malformation
Lymphangioma
Dacryocele","Eyelid varices may be just observed and followed up in most of the cases.
It is possible to treat a small varix just like haemangioma with a precooled probe when applied with little pressure.
Ectatic periocular veins may be tried with sclerotherapy.
Surgical therapy
Patient with eyelid dysfunction or requiring cosmetic correction may undergo surgical excision."
Early pregnancy loss,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/early-pregnancy-loss,"Early pregnancy loss is non-induced embryonic or fetal death or passage of products of conception before 20 weeks gestation. Early pregnancy loss is also termed as spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as expulsion or extraction of an embryo or fetus weighing 500 g or less.
Spontaneous abortion in the first trimester is common, affecting at least 15–20% of the clinically recognized pregnancies. Approximately 80% of all cases of pregnancy loss occur within the first three months of pregnancy (first trimester).
According to March of Dimes, nearly 50% of all pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion most often before a woman misses a menstrual period or even knows she is pregnant.
The different stages of spontaneous abortion may include:

Threatened abortion (pregnancy may continue): There is vaginal bleeding without cervical dilation and abortion may or may not occur.
Inevitable abortion: It is a condition in which vaginal bleeding is profuse, cervix has dilated. Pregnancy will not continue and will proceed to incomplete/complete abortion.
Incomplete abortion: Products of conception are partially expelled.
Complete abortion: Products of conception are completely expelled.

Septic abortion is defined as abortion complicated by infection. Sepsis may result from infection if organisms rise from the lower genital tract following either spontaneous or unsafe abortion. Sepsis is more likely to occur if there are retained products of conception and evacuation has been delayed.
Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is defined as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20– 22 weeks of gestation. The causes of RSA can be often related to factors associated with implantation, genetics, autoimmunity, endocrine abnormalities, infection, and anatomic uterine defects.
Missed abortion: In missed abortion there is pregnancy loss after the development of embryo or fetus; but it is retained within the uterine cavity. There may be brownish vaginal discharge or spotting. 
Anembryonic gestation is pregnancy in which a gestational sac develops without development of any embryonic structures; previously referred to as an “empty sac” or “blighted ovum.
Induced abortion is defined as a process by which pregnancy is terminated before fetal viability.
Unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure performed either by persons lacking necessary skills or in an environment lacking minimal medical standards, or both.","Signs and symptoms of spontaneous abortion may be:

Vaginal bleeding: The most common symptom of spontaneous abortion is vaginal bleeding with a history of delayed periods. This can vary from light spotting or brownish discharge to heavy bleeding and bright-red blood or clots. The bleeding may come and go over several days.
Cramps in lower abdomen and pelvic pain;
expulsion of tissue in incomplete or complete abortions.
Vaginal discharge, pain and fever in case of septic abortions.","In most of the cases of early pregnancy loss, cause of spontaneous abortion is not known; approximately 50% of all cases of early pregnancy loss are due to fetal chromosomal abnormalities. 
Other causes include:

Hormonal problems like poly cystic ovary syndrome( PCOS), luteal phase defects
Maternal infections such as sexually transmitted infections, TORCH infections (toxoplasmosis, others including syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes virus, HIV)
Maternal health problems (uncontrolled diabetes, thyroid disease, hypertension, kidney disease)
Autoimmune disorders
Uterine abnormalities
Problems of placenta
Incompetent cervix (weakness of cervix)

Risk factors for spontaneous abortion-

Having two or more previous spontaneous abortions
Being 35 years or older
Life style problems (smoking, drinking alcohol or using harmful drugs, exposure to radiation or toxic substances)
Having certain prenatal tests, like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling
Too much caffeine during pregnancy
Obesity","A thorough evaluation is needed to make a definitive diagnosis as common symptoms of early pregnancy loss, such as vaginal bleeding and pain in lower abdomen, also are common in normal pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and molar pregnancy.
Diagnosis includes a detailed medical history and physical examination combined with ultrasonography and human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) testing are helpful in making confirm diagnosis.
Ultrasonography is used to verify the presence of intrauterine pregnancy; to rule out ectopic pregnancy and to know the status of pregnancy. Sometimes repetitive sonography is required to make a definitive diagnosis; whether the embryo is still growing in the uterusor to determine whether products of conception are remained in the uterus or expelled completely.
Laboratory test-
Hemoglobin estimation: It is done to evaluate anemia.
Urine pregnancy test: It is used to confirm pregnancy state.
Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) testing: Serial quantitative blood tests are used to determine the viability of a pregnancy.
Blood group and Rh typing are done, if these are not already known. Rh typing is used to plan for administration of anti- Rh D immunoglobulin in Rh-negative woman.","Management depends on the stage of spontaneous abortion.
Threatened abortion: No medications such as hormones (e.g. estrogens or progestins) or tocolytic agents are helpful as they will not prevent abortion.
Inevitable and incomplete abortion:During and after the miscarriage the aim is to prevent the haemorrhage and infection. Management options for early pregnancy loss include expectant management, medical treatment, or surgical evacuation.
Expectant management: After discussing all treatment options (expectant, medical, and surgical management) with the woman to allow her to make an informed choice; many women first prefer to take a “wait and see” approach in hopes that spontaneous abortion will be complete. This is called expectant management. It is generally limited to pregnancies within the first trimester and if woman is haemodynamically stable. Proper counseling is given to the woman who is waiting for spontaneous passage of the products of conception.
It should be avoided in woman with:

at increased risk of haemorrhage;
previous bad obstetrical experience;
evidence for presence of infection.

Medical management- For patients who prefer to avoid surgical evacuation,medical management of early pregnancy loss can be advised with the proper counseling about bleeding, pain and that surgery may be needed if medical management does not achieve complete expulsion. Follow-up of the cases includes confirmation of complete expulsion by ultrasound examination, or serial serum β-hCG measurement used in settings where ultrasonography is unavailable.
Surgical management- Forinevitable, incomplete, or missed abortions, treatment is uterine evacuation. Evacuation usually involves suction curettage in less than12 weeks pregnancy and dilatation and evacuation at 12 to 23 weeks of pregnancy. Many women prefer surgical evacuation to expectant or medical treatment because it provides more immediate completion of the process with less follow-up.
A complete abortionusually needs no further treatment, medically or surgically.
After aninduced or spontaneous abortion,parents may feel grief and guilt. They should be given emotional support and, in the case of spontaneous abortions, reassured that their actions were not the cause.
Some women may want to become pregnant soon after having an abortion. They should be encouraged to delay the next pregnancy until they have completely recovered.
Abortion care should always include comprehensive contraceptive counselling with initiation of the method of choice as soon as desired after the abortion.
Rh-immunoglobulin:Women who are Rh negative and unsensitized should receive 50 micrograms of Rh (D)- immunoglobulin immediately after surgical management of early pregnancy loss or within 72 hours of the diagnosis of early pregnancy loss with planned medical management or expectant management in the first trimester. It is reasonable to use the more readily available 300-microgram dose if the 50-microgram dose is unavailable."
Eclampsia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/eclampsia,"Eclampsia is the onset of fits (convulsions) in a woman whose pregnancy is usually complicated by pre-eclampsia. The fits may occur in pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation, in labour, or during the first 48 hours of the postpartum period. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are part of the same disorder with eclampsia being the severe form of the disease.
Pre-eclampsia almost always precedes eclampsia. However, not all cases follow an orderly progression from mild to severe disease and some women develop severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia very suddenly. Most cases of eclampsia present in the third trimester of pregnancy, with about 80% of eclamptic seizures occurring intrapartum (during labour) or within the first 48 hours following delivery.
Among the hypertensive disorders, preeclampsia and eclampsia have the greatest impact on maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Nearly one-tenth of maternal deaths in Asia and Africa and one-quarter of maternal deaths in Latin America are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Eclampsia accounts for 12% of all maternal deaths in developing countries.
Eclampsia is also an important etiological factor for maternal/perinatal morbidity and mortality in India. In a study from a large population-based nationally representative sample of women in India, out of 4925 live births during the study period, there were 158 women with eclampsia, giving an incidence of 3.2 %. *
Majority of deaths related to pre-eclampsia and eclampsia could be avoided by timely and effective antenatal care and hospital delivery.","Eclampsia is the onset of fits in a woman whose pregnancy is usually complicated by pre-eclampsia. The fits may occur in pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation, in labour, or during the first 48 hours of the postpartum period.
Symptoms and signs of severe preeclampsia such as: diastolic blood pressure 90mm Hg or more after 20 weeks gestation, hyper-reflexia, headache (increasing frequency, unrelieved by regular analgesics), clouding of vision, oliguria (passing less than 400ml urine in 24 hours), upper abdominal pain (epigastric pain or pain in right upper quadrant), difficulty in breathing (pulmonary oedema) may precede eclamptic fit.
Stages of an eclamptic fit:
Premonitary stage: This lasts 10–20 seconds, during which:

the eyes roll or stare
the face and hand muscles may twitch.

Tonic stage: This lasts up to 30 seconds, during which:

the muscles go into violent spasm
the fists are clenched and arms and legs are rigid
the diaphragm (which is a muscle separating the chest from the abdomen) is in spasm, so that breathing stops and the colour of the skin becomes blue or dusky (cyanosis)

the back may be arched
the teeth are clenched
the eyes bulge.

Clonic stage: This lasts 1–2 minutes and is marked by:

violent contraction and relaxation of the muscles
increased saliva causes “foaming” at the mouth and there is a risk of inhalation

deep, noisy breathing
the face looks congested (filled with blood) and swollen.

Coma stage: This may last for minutes or hours. The woman is deeply unconscious and often breathes noisily. The cyanosis fades but her face may still be swollen and congested. Further fits may occur. The woman may die after only one or two fits.","The causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia are not known.
The common pathophysiology of preeclampsia results from:
1. Vasoconstriction with exaggerated response to vasoactive substances.
2. Plasma volume reduction due to capillary leakage and redistribution and shift of the extracellular volume from the intravascular to the interstitial compartments
3. Platelet aggregation triggered by endothelial dysfunction which leads to intravascular thrombosis.
These three factors cause reduced perfusion of the brain, liver, kidneys, and the utero-placental complex and causing organ failure that endangers the lives of mother and fetus.
Effects on the mother:
These include:

Respiratory problems (asphyxia, aspiration of vomit, pulmonary oedema, broncho-pneumonia)
Hepatic disease (liver necrosis)
Renal complications (acute kidney failure)
Visual disturbances (temporary blindness due to oedema of the retina)
Effects on the brain (haemorrhage, thrombosis, oedema)
Cardiac problems (heart failure)
HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count)
Coagulopathy (clotting/coagulation failure)
Injuries during convulsions (fractures). The main causes of maternal death in eclampsia are intracerebral haemorrhage, pulmonary complications, kidney failure, liver failure and failure of more than one organ (e.g. heart + liver + kidney).

Effects on the fetus:
Pre-eclampsia is associated with a reduction in maternal placental blood flow which results in:

Hypoxia which may cause brain damage if severe or prolonged, and can result in physical or mental disability.
Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)
In severe cases the baby may be stillborn.


Risk factors-
The risk of eclampsia is more common in:

primigravidae (especially young teenagers and women over 35 years)
obese women
women with essential or renal hypertension
multiple pregnancy
women with – diabetes, hydatidiform mole, polyhydramnios, hydrops fetalis.

Community risk factors These include:

Lack of awareness about symptoms of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and the importance of early and regular antenatal care
Transportation problems
Financial hardship and inability to pay for transport and medical care
Low socioeconomic status
Community distrust of health care personnel

Health service risk factors These include:

Failure to monitor blood pressure and urine during antenatal care
Failure to counsel women and families about dangerous symptoms of severe pre-eclampsia and the importance of regular antenatal care
Delay in referral of women with symptoms and signs of severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia
Lack of a clear-cut management strategy/clinical protocols for dealing with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia
Lack of proper equipment and drugs to treat eclampsia
Inadequately trained staff to treat women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia","Diagnosis of eclampsia is done with the medical history and clinical examination along with some tests/ investigations. As preeclampsia precedes eclampsia, symptoms and signs of severe preeclampsia should be checked.
Symptoms and signs of eclampsia -

May have headache, visual disturbance, epigastric pain
Well-defined stages of fit - but no characteristic warning with which patient is familiar
Convulsions
Diastolic blood 90mm Hg or more after 20 weeks gestation
Proteinuria 2+ or more
May be unconscious
May pass less than 400ml urine in 24 hours
May have pulmonary oedema

Tests /investigation to confirm diagnosis
Urine test-The urine will show presence of protein.
Blood tests for renal and liver function tests and coagulation; and may show impaired renal and liver function and coagulation defects in women with eclampsia.
Blood film examination is done to exclude malaria.
Eclampsia should be differentiated from following diseases:
Epilepsy, cerebral malaria, meningitis, tetanus, puerperal sepsis (septicaemia).
Epilepsy- There is a history of epilepsy before pregnancy. There may be characteristic warning before convulsion, blood pressure is normal. Tests may show normal kidney function.
Cerebral malaria-If a woman living in an area endemic for malaria having fever, headaches with convulsions, malaria should be excluded by examination of blood film for malaria parasite.
Meningitis-Coma may precede convulsions, but hypertension is not a common feature. Stiffness of neck is there. Brudzinski’s neck sign and Kernig’s sign are positive. Diagnosis can be confirmed by lumber puncture.
Tetanus- A woman is considered protected from tetanus when she has received 2 doses of tetanus toxoid at least 4 weeks apart, and with an interval of at least 4 weeks between the last vaccine dose and pregnancy termination (delivery or abortion). Women who have received a vaccination series (5 injections) more than 10 years before the present pregnancy, should be given a booster.
Puerperal sepsis (septicaemia)- There is fever (temperature 38°C or more )with chills and general malaise, lower abdominal pain, tender uterus, subinvolution of uterus, purulent, foul-smelling lochia. There may also be light vaginal bleeding and shock.","Eclampsia is managed with the following steps:
1. Making sure the airways are clear and the woman can breathe.
2. Controlling the fits.
3. Controlling the blood pressure.
4. General care and monitoring, including controlling fluid balance.
5. Delivering the baby.
6. Monitoring carefully to prevent further fits and identify complications.
1. Making sure the airways are clear, and the woman can breathe:

Place the woman on her left side to reduce the risk of aspiration of secretions, vomit and blood
Give oxygen (if available) and continue for five minutes after each fit, or longer if cyanosis persists
After a convulsion, aspirate the mouth and throat as necessary to clear the airway
Stay with the woman and ensure that her airway is clear.

2.Controlling fits:
Fits are controlled by giving the woman anticonvulsant drugs. Magnesium sulfate is used for both the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.
Magnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant of choice for women with severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. If possible, give a full regimen of magnesium sulfate to women with eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia. If the administration of a full regimen is not possible, these women should be given the loading dose of magnesium sulfate and should be immediately transferred to a higher-level health care facility for further treatment.
If magnesium sulphate is not available, diazepam may be given, but there is a greater risk of neonatal depression because diazepam crosses the placenta freely. A single dose of diazepam is unlikely to cause much neonatal depression but, if treatment continues with this drug, the risk of neonatal depression increases and the effect may last for several days.
3.Controlling blood pressure:
Antihypertensive drugs should be given if the diastolic blood pressure is 110mmHg or more. The aim is to keep the diastolic blood pressure between 90–100mmHg to prevent cerebral haemorrhage. A smooth and sustained reduction in blood pressure over a three–hour period is preferred to a sudden drop.
4.General management and monitoring, including controlling of fluid balance:
The woman is nursed in a quiet, single room and must never be left alone, because she could fit at any time and inhale secretions or vomit and/or sustain serious injuries if there is no one in the room to gently restrain her.
Only essential care should be given such as turning the woman two–hourly, mouth care, (no oral fluids are given), insert a urinary catheter and monitor the urinary output and proper fluid balance.
5.Delivering the baby:
Delivery should take place as soon as the woman’s condition has stabilized, regardless of gestational age. In cases of eclampsia, delivery should occur within 12 hours of the onset of convulsions.
Medical professional may decide the method of delivery by taking into account the. gestational age, fetal and cervical status and urgency.
6.Monitoring carefully to prevent further fits and identify complications:
Fits can also recur after delivery or can occur for the first time after delivery, within the first 48 hours. Therefore, the woman must be very carefully observed for at least 48 hours after delivery.
Anticonvulsive therapy should be maintained for 24 hours after delivery or the last convulsion, whichever occurs last.
Antihypertensive therapy should be continued until the diastolic blood pressure decreases to less than 110mmHg. Urinary output should be monitored.
Four–hourly blood pressure checking should be continued for a few days."
Fracture (Bone fracture),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/fracture-bone-fracture,"Fracture is a medical condition which leads to break in the continuity of the bone. A bone fracture can be the result due to high force impact or stress, or trivial injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture.
Classification:
By Cause:

Traumatic fracture - This is a fracture due to trauma. e.g.- Fractures caused by a fall, road traffic accident, fight and many others
Pathological fracture - A fracture of bone due to certain disease that has made bone weak is called pathological fracture. e.g.- a fracture through a bone weakened by metastasis. Osteoporosis is the most common cause of pathological fracture.

All fractures can be broadly described as:

Closed (simple) fractures: Are those in which the skin is intact
Open (compound) fractures: Involve wounds that communicate with the fracture, and may thus expose bone to contamination. Open injuries carry a higher risk of infection.

Other types of fracture are:

Complete fracture: A fracture in which bone fragments separate completely.
Incomplete fracture: A fracture in which the bone fragments are still partially joined. In such cases, there is a crack in the osseous tissue that does not completely traverse the width of the bone.
Linear fracture: A fracture that is parallel to the bone's long axis.
Transverse fracture: A fracture that is at a right angle to the bone's long axis.
Oblique fracture: A fracture that is diagonal to a bone's long axis.
Spiral fracture: A fracture where at least one part of the bone has been twisted.
Comminuted fracture: A fracture in which the bone has broken into several pieces.
Impacted fracture: A fracture caused when bone fragments are driven into each other.
Avulsion fracture: A fracture where a fragment of bone is separated from the main mass.","Fractures can cause

Pain and bleeding
Swelling
Bruising or discolored skin around the affected area
The patient is unable to put weight on the injured area
The patient cannot move the affected area

If it is anopen fracture there may be:
Bleeding
Damage to adjacent structures such as nerves or vessels, spinal cord and nerve roots (for spine fractures), or cranial contents (for skull fractures) can cause other specific signs and symptoms.","The fractures are generally caused due to fall with a great impact or road accident.
Healthy bones are extremely tough and resilient and can withstand powerful impacts. When people enter old age two factors make their risk of fractures greater; weaker bones and a greater risk of falling. Children are physically more active than adults, thus they are more prone to accidents or fall that may result in fractures.People with debilitating illnesses and conditions that may weaken their bones also have a higher risk of fractures. Examples include osteoporosis, infection or a tumor.","A fractured bone can be diagnosed clinically based on the history and the physical examination of the patient.
Imaging by X-ray is often performed to view the bone suspected of being fractured.
In certain suitations, x-ray alone is not sufficient, a computed tomograph (CT scan) or MRI may be performed.",No Management.
Fibroids,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/reproductive-system/female-gynaecological-diseases-/fibroids,"Fibroids are non-cancerous tumors that grow in or around the uterus (womb). Fibroids are also known as uterine myomas or fibromyomas. Fibroids are made of muscle cells and fibrous tissues that grow in and around the wall of the uterus. The cause of fibroids is unknown. Risk factors include being overweight or obese and is mostly seen in African-American. They can grow anywhere in the uterus and are named according to their origin:

Intramural fibroids: These types grows within the muscle tissue of the uterus . This is the most common place for fibroids to form.
Sub serous fibroids: It grows from the outside wall of the uterus into the pelvis.
Sub mucous fibroids: It is generally seen in the inner wall into the middle of the uterus .
Pedunculated fibroids: It grows from the outside wall of the uterus or into cavity of uterus and is attached to it by a narrow stalk.","Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. If symptoms occur , these may include:

Heavy or painful periods or bleeding between periods
Feeling ""full"" in the lower abdomen
Frequent urination 
Pain during sex
Lowerback pain
Reproductive problems, such as infertility, multiple miscarriages or early labor","Fibroid is an overgrowth of smooth muscle cells. The uterus is mainly made of smooth muscle. The exact cause is still not clear.

It can be genetic.
It is seen that fibroids are sensitive to estrogen, the hormone that is made in the ovary. Fibroids tend to swell when levels of estrogen are high as duringpregnancy. They also shrink when estrogen levels are low after the menopause.","Physical examination: Some fibroids can be felt during an internal (vaginal) examination by a doctor.
Transvaginal ultrasound: A transvaginal ultrasound scan is sometimes used to diagnose fibroids. It is generally a painless procedure that involves inserting a small probe into the vagina. The probe uses sound waves to create an image of uterus on a TV monitor.
LaparoscopyIt is a procedure where a small tube that contains a light source and a camera is inserted into the abdomen. The camera transmits images of the inside of the abdomen or pelvis on a television monitor. The laparoscope can be flexible or rigid, depending on the procedure, but when diagnosing fibroids a rigid laparoscope is most often used.
For accurate diagnosis please consult your physician.","Medicines that are used to treat heavy periods are:

Tranexamic acid is prescribed for 3-4 times a day. It works by reducing the breakdown of blood clots in the womb.
Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and mefenamic acid. These also help to ease period pain. They are taken for a few days at the time of period. They work by reducing the high level of a chemical (prostaglandin) in the lining of the uterus . Prostaglandin seems to contribute to heavy and painful periods.

Medication to shrink the fibroids:Women are given a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. This is a hormonal medicine that leads to low level of estrogen in body. Fibroids shrink if the level of estrogen falls. However, a low estrogen level can cause symptoms similar to the menopause (hot flushes, etc). These medications may also increase the risk ofosteoporosis. Therefore this treatment is given for a maximum period of six months. GnRH analogues, such as goserelin (eg Zoladex®) or leuprorelin acetate (eg Prostap® SR), are often prescribed for three to four months before having an operation, which will make it easier to remove fibroids. Sometimes a low dose of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is also given to reduce the incidence of menopausal side-effects.
A new medication treatment undergoing trials:A medicine called ulipristal acetate (UPA) has shown promise in preliminary research trials. This is currently used as an emergency contraceptive. It works by blocking the effects of the hormone progestogen. Progestogen is thought to play a role in fibroid development and so it was thought that this medicine may help to shrink fibroids. A small research trial has concluded that it does seem to have an effect on shrinking fibroids, with side-effects not being too troublesome. Further larger clinical trials are needed to establish whether this is indeed a good treatment option.
Surgery and other operative treatments:There are several different operations available to remove and treat fibroids.
Hysterectomy: This is the traditional and most common treatment for fibroids. Hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus.
Myomectomy: This is a possible alternative, especially in women who may wish to have children in the future. In this operation, the fibroids are removed and the uterus is left. This procedure is not always possible.
Endometrial ablation: This procedure involves removing the lining of the womb. This can be done by different methods for example, using laser energy, a heated wire loop or by microwave heating. This method is usually recommended for fibroids close to the inner lining of the uterus

Filariasis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/filariasis,"Filariasis is caused by several round, coiled and thread-like parasitic worms that belongs to the family filaridea. These parasites penetrate the skin either their own or through the opening created by mosquito bites to reach the lymphatic system.
The disease is caused by the nematode worm, either Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi and is transmitted by mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia annulifera/M.uniformis respectively.
The disease generally presents with the symptoms like swelling of legs, and hydrocele and can cause a raft of societal stigma.
Lymphatic Filariasis (LF)is commonly known as elephantiasis. It is a disfiguring and disabling disease, which is generally aquired in childhood. In the early stages,though there are either no symptoms or non-specific symptoms, the lymphatic system is damaged. This stage can last for several years. Infected persons sustain the transmission of the disease. The long term physical consequences are painful swollen limbs (lymphoedemaor elephantiasis). Hydrocele in males is also common in endemic areas.
National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme

Filariasis control in India and Its Elimination","Lymphatic filariasis infection involves asymptomatic, acute, and chronic conditions.The majority of infections are asymptomatic, showing no external signs of infection,although their blood is positive for microfilaria. This stage may lasts for months.
Acute episodes of local inflammation involving skin, lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels.
Chronic condition shows oedema with thickening of the skin and underlying tissues (the classical symptom of filarasis).
It usually affects the lower extremities. However, the arms, vulva, breasts and scrotum (causing hydrocele formation) can also be affected.The oedema in the extremities, breast or genital area can result in the part becoming several times its normal size and is due to blockage of the vessels of the lymphatic system.","Most cases of filariasis are caused by the parasite known as Wuchereria bancrofti. Culex, Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes serve as vector for W.bancrofti in transmission of the disease. Another parasite called Brugia malayi also causes filariasis is transmitted by the vector Mansonia and Anopheles mosquitoes.
When an infected mosquito bites a healthy person, the larvae called microfilariae move into the lymphatics and lymph nodes. Here, they develop into adult worms and may persist for years.
The adult parasite, in turn, produces more microfilariae. These microfilariae circulate in the peripheral blood usually in the night, and are sucked by the mosquitoes during a bite.  The same cycle is then repeated in another healthy individual.","Blood sample:
The microfilariae that cause lymphatic filariasis circulate in the blood at night (called nocturnal periodicity). Blood collection should be done at night to coincide with the appearance of the microfilariae, and a thick smear should be made and stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin. For increased sensitivity, concentration techniques can be used.
Serological examination:
Serologic techniques provide an alternative to microscopic detection of microfilariae for the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis. Patients with active filarial infection typically have elevated levels of antifilarial IgG4 in the blood and these can be detected using routine assays.
For further diagnosis, consult your physician.","Maintenanceof Good hygiene of the affected part prevents the worsening of the lymphoedema and secondary bacterial skin infections.
The affected limb should be kept elevated and regular exercises should be done to improve the lymph flow.
The recommended regimen for treatment of filariasis is mass drug administration (MDA) in which a single dose of two medicines are given together - albendazole (400 mg) with either ivermectin (150-200 mcg/kg) in areas where onchocerciasis (river blindness) is also endemic or diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) (6 mg/kg ) in areas where onchocerciasis is not endemic. These medicines clear microfilariae from the bloodstream.
Though Lymphatic filariasis is treated with medicines, there is persistent abnormal enlargement of body parts causing pain and severe disability. Associated social stigma makes patients to suffer mentally, socially and financially. Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of infection with mass drug administration (MDA) and protection from mosquito bites and vector control measures.

Food Poisoning,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/stomach/food-poisoning,"Food poisoning is illness that results due to the consumption of food or drink which is contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins or chemicals. Most people recover without the need for treatment. In most cases, the food that causes the illness has been contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or Escherichia coli, or a virus, such as the norovirus. The contamination of food can occur at any point beginning from growing, till processing and shipping of the product. Improper cooking of the food may also be the cause for contamination other cause can be when pathogens are transferred from one surface to another especially in case of ready-to-eat foods or raw foods. Since these foods aren’t cooked before consumption, pathogens are not destroyed and ingesting them may lead to food poisoning. This is called cross-contamination. Thus the contamination of food may occur at any stage in the process from food production to consumption.","The symptoms of food poisoning may begin at any point between few hours and several weeks after eating contaminated food. They include:

Feeling unwell
Vomiting
Diarrhoea
Stomach cramps

Other symptoms of food poisoning include:

Abdominal pain
Loss of appetite
A high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
Muscle pain
Chills","Food borne illness are usually infectious or toxic in nature and caused by bacteria ,viruses, parasites or chemical substances entering the body through contaminated food or water arise from improper handling, preparation or storage of food. 
Cross-contamination:Cross-contamination is a cause of food poisoning that is often over looked. It occurs when harmful bacteria are spread between food, surfaces and equipment.
Most common organisms that cause food poisoning:

Bacteria-

-Campylobacter jejuni
-Clostridium perfringens
-Salmonella species . – S. typhi-murium infection
-Escherichia coli (E. coli )

Viruses (noro virus)
Parasites (Toxoplasmosis)
Mushrooms and toadstools: Dozens of species can cause muscarine poisoning. These poisons attack the central nervous system, causing partial or complete paralysis in severe cases.
Fish:Some fish, like the puffer fish, are naturally poisonous. A poison similar to that naturally found in the puffer fish can also occur in many edible Caribbean and Pacific species. It's called ciguatera poison, and it's produced by a tiny sea parasite called dinoflagellate. This poison attacks the nervous system.
Insecticides:There are many types of poisons found in insecticides but the most dangerous types are the organophosphates, which are basically nerve gas for insects. Such insecticides are deliberately formulated to be less harmful to humans than insects, but these chemicals can be very dangerous to people if the insecticides are not used properly.
There are many other causes of food poisoning. These include wild nuts, leaves, flowers and berries, under ripe tubers, botulism, cadmium from containers, lead or arsenic from fertilizers, and acids and lead from pottery.","Generally detailed history including signs, symptoms and details of food intake are used to diagnose for the food poisoning.Symptoms may include pain in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and signs and symptoms of dehydration (body does not have as much water and fluids as it should) 
Stool test: Sometimes stool test is done for detecting bacteria or parasites.","In most cases of food poisoning, symptoms can be relieved at home without seeing physician.
Oral rehydration salts: If diarrhoea persists, oral rehydration solution as ORS, should be drunk to replace the fluid losses and prevent dehydration.
Drink plenty of fluids: This is to prevent dehydration

Frost Bite,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/frost-bite,"Frostbite is a medical condition involving damage to skin and tissues due to extreme cold. Frostbite is most likely to happen in body parts that are far from the heart or those with large exposed areas to cold weather. The initial stages of frostbite are sometimes called ""frost nip"". A person with frostbite on the arms or legs may also have hypothermia (lowered body temperature). Frostbite can occur when skin is exposed to a temperature of 0 °C (32 °F) or lower, resulting in vasoconstriction. The resultant decrease in blood flow does not deliver sufficient heat to the tissue to prevent the formation of ice crystals. The anatomic sites most susceptible to frostbite include hands, feet, and exposed tissues (eg, ears, nose, and lips).","At or below 0 °C (32 °F), blood vessels close to the skin start to constrict, and blood is shunted away from the extremities via the action of the glomus bodies (glomus bodies are most numerous in the fingers and toes. The role of the glomus body is to shunt blood away from the skin surface when exposed to cold temperature, thus preventing heat loss, and on the other hand, it allows maximum heat flow to the skin in warm weather, to allow heat dissipation. The glomus body has a high sympathetic tone and its potentiation leads to near complete vasoconstriction). There are four degrees of frostbite. Each of these degrees has varying degrees of pain.
First degree: It is known as frost nip. It only affects the surface of skin, which is exposed. On the onset, there is itching and pain, and then the skin develops white, red, and yellow patches and becomes numb. The area affected by frost nip usually does not become permanently damaged as only the skin's top layers are affected.
Second degree: If skin is exposed to cold for longer duration, then it may freeze and harden, but the deep tissues are generally not affected and remain soft and normal. Second-degree injury causes blister formation after about one or two days of exposure. The blisters may become hard and blackened, but usually appear worse than they are. Most of the injuries heal in about one month, but the area may become permanently insensitive to both heat and cold.
Third and fourth degrees: If the exposed area freezes further, deep frostbite occurs. The muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves all freeze. The skin becomes hard, feels waxy, and the area is lost temporarily, and may be permanent in severe cases. The deep frostbite results in areas of purplish blisters which turn black and which are generally blood-filled. Nerve damage in the area can result in loss of sensations. This extreme frostbite in fingers and toes, may require amputation, if the area becomes infected with gangrene. If the frostbite has not treated, it may fall off. The extent of damage done to the area by freezing process of frostbite may take several months to assess, and this often delays surgery to remove the dead tissue.","Frostbite generally occurs when body is exposed to low temperatures.
The severity of frostbite depends on the temperature and period of exposure. When the temperature is below freezing point, it leads to frostbite due to inadequate blood circulation to the exposed body parts. This can be due to the body's reaction to freezing by constricting circulation to the extremities so as to preserve its temperature and fight hypothermia. It can further lead to hypothermia (extreme cold, inadequate clothing, wet clothes, wind chill). Poor circulation can also be due to other factors such as cramped positions, tight clothing, fatigue, certain medications, smoking, alcohol use, or diseases that affect the blood vessels such as diabetes.","Frost bite is generally diagnosed based on the symptoms
Imaging Scans: 
MRI and X-rays can also be used to know the extent of severity in the frost bite.
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis purpose you should consult your physician.","It is better to prevent from being exposed to cold by taking necessary precautions.
Re-warming: It should be done only if that skin area will not be exposed to cold further. Ideally, re-warming should be done under medical supervision as:

It can be a painful process that might require painkillers.
The best results are achieved by using a whirlpool bath that contains a mild antiseptic. The affected area should be re-warmed slowly by immersing it in warm (not hot) water. A bath of water at a temperature of 40-41C (104-105.8F) is recommended. Re-warming should last at least 30 minutes and should only be stopped once the affected body part becomes red-purple in colour and can be easily moved.

Filamentary Keratitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/filamentary-keratitis,"Filamentary keratitis is a chronic disorder in which filaments, which are adherent complexes of mucus and corneal epithelium, are present on the corneal surface. Filaments consist of a variable combination of degenerated epithelial cells and mucous which are attached to the corneal surface at one end. Filaments present as small, gelatinous strands on the anterior surface of the cornea and may vary in size, shape, composition, and distribution.
Leber in 1882, first described the characteristic threads adherent to anterior surface of the cornea (Leber. Klin Monatsbl f Augenh; 1882. P. 165). Beetham in 1935, published an extensive review and potential therapy options. He outlined that the formation of filaments is due to lacrimal gland destruction and is produced by various systemic reasons viz. infection, lymphoma or hormone dysfunction (Beetham W. Filamentary Keratitis. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc. 1935; 33: 413-435).
A lack of tear production may result in the increased production of mucous by conjunctival goblet cells. Aqueous-deficient eye is characterised by excessive abnormal debris and mucous strands, which adhere firmly to the damaged areas of corneal epithelium and basement membrane, forming corneal filaments. There may be grey sub-epithelial granular opacity, beneath the attachment to the corneal epithelium. Once established, corneal filaments are firmly attached to the underlying corneal epithelium. Friction between corneal filaments and the upper lid results in pain, epithelial tears and inflammation which leads to further filament formation.
Patients affected with filamentary keratitis are often highly symptomatic and may have persistent foreign body sensation, redness and sensitivity to light, which may vary from moderate to severe in intensity.
Filamentary keratitis can be a functionally debilitating and sight threatening feature of a number of ocular and systemic conditions such as:

Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome): Both autoimmune (Sjögren syndrome) and non-autoimmune forms of aqueous-deficient dry eye conditions may have corneal filaments. This is the commonest cause of filamentary keratitis. Sjögren syndrome may be primary Sjögren syndrome when these changes occur in isolation, or secondary Sjögren syndrome when associated with connective tissue/ other diseases viz. systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, juvenile chronic arthritis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or primary biliary cirrhosis.
Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is the second most common disease associated with corneal filaments.
Exposure keratitis.
Corneal oedema. 
Corneal surgery e.g. corneal refractive surgery.
Post-cataract surgery.
Use of contact lenses.
Adenoviral keratitis.
Herpes simplex keratitis.
Bacterial keratitis.
Neurotrophic keratopathy.
Extended eyelid closure secondary to medications.
Extended patching of eyes.
Acne rosacea
Systemic use of diuretics.
Systemic use of antihistamines.

No associated disease is found in few cases.","Patient with Filamentary keratitis may have ocular (eye) symptoms like:

Foreign body sensation.
Redness.
Increased blinking.
Discomfort.
Lacrimation or watering.
Photophobia (sensitivity to light).
Blurring of vision.
Blepharospasm (abnormal contraction of eyelid muscles).


The irritation in eyes is exacerbated by blinking and is usually present throughout the day.
Patients may not have symptoms with their eyes closed.","Filamentary keratitis is associated with a number of conditions or diseases associated with the ocular surface.
Aetiology of filamentary keratitis is related to:

An alteration in the components of the tear film and /or 
Abnormalities of the corneal surface.

Common risk factors include:

Aqueous tear deficiency: Aqueous tear deficiency as in keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
Systemic diseases having effects on the corneal surface: Systemic diseases (e.g. Sjögren syndrome) having effects on the corneal surface.
Corneal exposure: Corneal exposure as in seventh cranial nerve palsy.
Ocular surgery: Ocular surgery (e.g. keratoplasty, cataract surgery).
Anti-cholinergic medicines: Use of anti-cholinergic medicines for long periods.
Ptosis (drooping) of upper eyelids: Ptosis (drooping) of upper eyelids may lead to poor tear distribution and reduction in oxygenation of the corneal epithelium.

The filaments are gelatinous and refractile in appearance and can vary from 0.5mm sessile adhesions to 10mm long strings. Filaments are generally attached to the basement membrane of the corneal epithelium at one end, with the other end freely moveable. Filamentary keratitis is associated with underlying basement membrane abnormalities, most of which are related to hypertonic tear film states. Filaments elongate and coil with movement of the eyelids.
The ratio of mucous to aqueous is usually increased because of:

A decrease in aqueous tear production or
Increased mucous production or
Abnormal mucous accumulation.

A relative deficiency in the aqueous component of tear film is usually present in cases of filamentary keratitis, which produces a relative increase in the mucinous component.
Abnormalities of the ocular surface result in defects in the corneal epithelium that allow for anchoring of filaments.
Filamentary keratitis and dry eye: 
Dry eye is the disorder most frequently associated with filamentary keratitis. There is increase in tear film osmolarity due to reduced aqueous tear secretion or increased tear film stasis, which leads to increase in mucous to aqueous ratio. This imbalance of mucous to tear ratio leads to sloughing of epithelial cells and produces epithelial defects. Mucous serves as a disposal system for exfoliated epithelial cells. Increase in viscosity of mucous enhances its adherence to irregularities on corneal epithelium, thus, potential for filament formation.","Diagnosis of filamentary keratitis is based on the clinical history and slit lamp examination (bio-microscopy), being conducted by an eye specialist.
Signs on slit lamp examination:

Corneal filaments (mucoepithelioid strands): There may be multiple small, grey, mucoid filamentary attachments, firmly adherent to the corneal surface. Blinking causes painful traction on the filaments and may even detach them, leaving behind an epithelial corneal defect. Filaments may be stained best with rose bengal dye, but may be seen with fluorescein sodium and lissamine green stain as well.

Location of the filament may help determine the underlying cause,
Filaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy: Filaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy are usually found in the interpalpebral space.
Filaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Filaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis are seen superiorly on cornea.
Filaments due to ocular surgery: Filaments due to ocular surgery are found at the site of wound or surgical trauma.
For example, filaments following corneal transplantation are seen near sutures at the graft-host junction. After cataract surgery, they may be overlying or alongside the corneal incision. Surgery-specific factors, such as the disruption of proper tear flow, pooling, toxicity from medications, and local trauma, may predispose to filament formation.

Decreased aqueous tears: There may be decrease in aqueous tears with abnormal tear break-up time (BUT).
Increased mucinous element: Increased mucinous element in the pre-corneal tear film
Superficial punctate keratopathy.
Sub epithelial opacities: Sub epithelial opacities at the base of filaments.
Epithelial defects: Frank corneal epithelial defects.


Histopathology:
Traditionally, it is said that the filament is composed of mucous and degenerated epithelial cells, and is adherent to the corneal epithelium at the base.
Wright used histochemical stains to suggest that filaments form when mucous in the tear film attaches to receptors on the corneal surface. Subsequent proliferation of a filament occurs as mucous accumulates cellular and other degenerative material. (Wright P. Filamentary keratitis. Trans Ophthalmol Soc UK 1975; 95: 260-266).
Zaidman et al. used electron microscopy to report that scattered groups of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts are present below the basement membrane of the corneal epithelium where filaments are attached (Zaidman GW, Geeraets R, Paylor RR, et al. The histopathology of filamentary keratitis. Arch Ophthalmol 1985; 103:1178-1181). It is suggested that an underlying pathological process damages the basement epithelium, leading to focal areas of its detachment from Bowman’s layer. This raised-epithelium subsequently becomes a nidus for mucous and degenerated cells.
Tanioka et al. proposed that corneal epithelium cells form the core of the filament and an admixture of multiple surface mucins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) material, and degenerated conjunctival epithelial cells become wound around the core to produce a braided shape (Tanioka H, Yokoi N, Komuro A, et al. Investigationof the corneal filament in filamentary keratitis. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2009; 50: 3696-3702).
Impression cytology of the conjunctiva may show squamous metaplasia and reduced goblet cell with inflammatory cell infiltrates (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922815).","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Diagnosis of filamentary keratitis may be fairly easy but its management and resolution may be challenging.
Any underlying disease such as dry eye disease or blepharitis is treated first, to improve the ocular surface initially. The underlying causes of filament formation, such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, toxic keratoconjunctivitis, contact lens over wear, or ptosis should initially be identified and treated.
Because of the multi-factorial aetiology of filamentary keratitis, treatment of this disease can be frustrating for both the patient and the treating physician.
Medical therapy:
Filamentary keratitis may be an acute or chronic condition. Some acute conditions resolve spontaneously, but more often than not, treatment is prolonged and chronic. Treatment should be given to keep the disease from progressing and to protect the corneal epithelium from additional insult due to dryness or trauma. Topical medications require their judicial use, since the cornea is more susceptible to the intrinsic and preservative toxicities of the drugs.

Topical artificial tears: The first line of treatment is administration of topical artificial tears during the day and ointment or higher viscosity tears at bedtime. Preferably, non-preserved tear substitutes are used. Low viscosity tears may improve the tear film osmolarity, but more viscous tear substitutes can also provide substantial relief from microscopic corneal abrasions. Different tear substitutes are tried and individualised according to the benefit obtained in a particular patient. Many different tear preparations are available, and any of these may be beneficial in a given patient.
Topical sodium chloride: Topical sodium chloride improves corneal epithelium by reducing oedema and obviates focal detachment in some patients.
N-acetylcysteine: N-acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent which decreases the viscosity of mucous in the pre-corneal tear film. The ocular solution is not commercially available and must be formulated without preservatives from the respiratory preparation.
Bandage contact lens: A bandage contact lens is often successful in cases of filamentary keratitis that do not respond to ocular lubrication. The contact lens prevents the rubbing of corneal epithelium and eyelids and may help to eliminate or reduce reactive ptosis that often occurs and exacerbates the condition. High oxygen permeability soft contact lenses may be used for better tolerance. Patients should be closely monitored because of the inherent risks of contact lens wear (e.g. infective keratitis) in dry eye patients with compromised ocular surface.
Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroid (e.g. methylprednisolone) may reduce inflammation in filamentary keratitis. A satisfactory control of symptoms and filaments may be obtained with only short bursts of therapy in most cases. Corticosteroids are reserved for acute exacerbations since they can lead to complications like raised intraocular pressure or cataract formation.
Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce inflammation/ symptoms and accelerate resolution of disease. The toxicity of NSAIDs on the damaged epithelium in a dry eye patient should be weighed against benefits of therapy.

Associated meibomian gland dysfunction may require measures like lid hygiene, warm compresses, topical azithromycin, oral tetracycline derivatives and omega-3 fatty acids.
Topical cyclosporine may be considered in treatment of dry eye.
Surgical therapy:

Debridement of filaments: Debridement of filaments may be done under topical anaesthesia on slit lamp. Care should be taken to remove the entire filament without damaging the corneal epithelium at the base of the filament. Post-operative topical antibiotic for several days, a pressure patch with lubricating ointment or a bandage contact lens may be prescribed to minimise discomfort.
Occlusion of punctum: Punctal occlusion may increase the aqueous tear component in some cases. Temporary punctal plugs should be utilised before permanent punctal occlusion, because in many cases, temporary improvement in tear film volume can resolve filamentary keratitis. This may obviate the need for permanent punctal occlusion. Any associated meibomian gland dysfunction is treated to minimise retention of mucous in the tear film from punctal occlusion.


Prognosis:
Prognosis of filamentary keratitis is generally good and it depends upon the effectiveness in managing the predisposing condition. At times, chronic management of this condition requires patience in both the patient and the treating physician."
Fluorosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/fluorosis,"Fluorosis is a crippling disease resulted from deposition of fluorides in the hard and soft tissues of body. It is a public health problem caused by excess intake of fluoride through drinking water/food products/industrial pollutants over a long period. Ingestion of excess fluoride, most commonly in drinking-water affects the teeth and bones.
It results in major health disorders like dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis and non-skeletal fluorosis. People exposed to large amounts of fluoride show dental effects much earlier than the skeletal effects. Dental fluorosis affects children and discolours and disfigures the teeth. Skeletal fluorosis affects the bones and major joints of the body like neck, back bone, shoulder, hip and knee joints resulting in to severe pain, rigidity or stiffness in joints. Severe forms of skeletal fluorosis results in marked disability. Non-skeletal forms of fluorosis are earlier manifestations, which develop long before the onset of typical changes in teeth and skeletal bones these are seen as gastro-intestinal symptoms and may overlap with other diseases leading to misdiagnosis. It affects men, women and children of all age groups.
Fluorosis is worldwide in distribution and endemic at least in 25 countries. It has been reported from fluoride belts: one that stretches from Syria through Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Sudan and Kenya, and another that stretches from Turkey through Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India, northern Thailand and China. There are similar belts in the Americas and Japan.
High levels of Fluoride were reported in 230 districts of 20 States of India (after bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014). The population at risk as per population in habitations with high fluoride is 11.7 million as on 1.4.2014*. Rajasthan, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are worst affected states. Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are moderately affected states while Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam are mildly affected states.
In India fluorosis is mainly due to excessive fluoride in water except in parts of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh where industrial fluorosis is also seen. The desirable limit of fluoride as per Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is 1ppm (parts per million or 1 mg per litre).
The late stages of skeletal and dental fluorosis are permanent and irreversible in nature and are detrimental to the health of an individual and the community, which in turn has adverse effects on growth, development &amp; economy of the country.
The Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission started by Ministry of Rural Development worked for control of fluorosis through its awareness campaign from 1987- 1993, (coordinated by Fluorosis Control Cell at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi) had a limited coverage.
In 2008-09, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India launched a National Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis (NPPCF) with the aim for prevention, diagnosis and management of fluorosis in endemic areas.","It is not necessary that all symptoms are present at the same time. The severity and duration, (which is often episodic), depend on a person’s age, nutritional status, environment, kidney function, amount of fluoride ingested, genetic background, tendency to allergies, and other factors such as hardness of the water due to presence of calcium and magnesium.
Various symptoms are:

Dental fluorosis: Clinical dental fluorosis is evident by staining and pitting of the teeth. In more severe cases all the enamel may be damaged (however, fluoride may not be the only cause of dental enamel defects; enamel opacities similar to dental fluorosis are associated with other conditions, such as vitamins A and D deficiency or a low protein-energy diet). Ingestion of fluoride after six years of age will not cause dental fluorosis. The teeth could be chalky white and may have white, yellow, brown or black spots or streaks on the enamel surface. Discolouration is away from the gums and bilaterally symmetrical.
Skeletal fluorosis: The early symptoms of skeletal fluorosis, include stiffness and pain in the joints. In severe cases, the bone structure may change and ligaments may calcify, with resulting impairment of muscles and pain. Constriction of vertebral canal and intervertebral foramen exerts pressure on nerves, blood vessels leading to paralysis and pain.

Non skeletal fluorosis/ Effects of fluorosis on soft tissues /systems:

Gastrointestinal symptoms: Abdominal pain, excessive saliva, nausea and vomiting are seen after acute high-level exposure to fluoride.
Neurological manifestation: Nervousness and depression, tingling sensation in fingers and toes, excessive thirst and tendency to urinate
Muscular manifestations: Muscle weakness &amp; stiffness, pain in the muscle and loss of muscle power, inability to carry out normal routine activities.
Allergic manifestation: Skin rashes, Perivascular inflammation: pinkish red or bluish red spot, round or oval shape on the skin that fade and clear up within 7-10 days.
Effects on foetus: Fluoride can also damage a foetus, if the mother consumes water/food with high concentrations of fluoride during pregnancy/breast feeding. Abortions, still births and children with birth defects are common in endemic areas.
Low haemoglobin levels: Fluoride accumulates on the erythrocyte (red blood cells) membrane, which in turn looses calcium content. The membrane which is deficient in calcium content is pliable and is thrown into folds. The shape of erythrocytes is changed. Such RBCs are called echinocytes, and found in circulation. The echinocytes undergo phagocytosis (eaten-up by macrophages) and are eliminated from circulation. This would lead to low haemoglobin levels in patients chronically ill due to fluoride toxicity.
Urinary tract manifestations Urine may be much less in volume; yellow-red in colour and itching in the region may occur.
Ligaments and blood vessel calcification: A unique feature of the disease is soft tissues like ligaments, blood vessels tend to harden and calcify and the blood vessels may be blocked.

Most of these manifestations are, no doubt, nonspecific, but their occurrence in subjects living in fluorosis-endemic areas should alert suspicion. These early warning signs have been extremely helpful in early detection of large numbers of cases in rural areas; prompt intervention programmes (i.e. providing safe drinking water) in these cases have provided considerable relief within a short span of time","Fluorosis is caused by excessive intake of fluorides from multiple sources such as in food, water, air (due to gaseous industrial waste), and excessive use of toothpaste. However, drinking water is the most significant source.
Moderate-level chronic exposure (above 1.5 mg/litre of water - the WHO guideline value for fluoride in water) is more common. Acute high-level exposure to fluoride is rare and usually due to accidental contamination of drinking-water or due to fires or explosions.
Fluoride in water is mostly of geological origin. Water with high levels of fluoride content are mostly found at the foot of high mountains and in areas where geological deposits are collected in sea. The drinking water fluoride so far detected in the country ranges from 0.2 to 48 mg/ litre. The desirable limit of fluoride as per Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is 1ppm.
Other risk factors-

Several of the ready to serve foods, beverages, snacks have high content of black rock salt (CaF2) or ‘kala namak’ (which has 157ppm fluoride) and red rock salts.
Tobacco or supari (aracanut) when they are chewed.
Intake of certain drugs such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics, few anti-depressants, some anti-fungal drugs, cholesterol-lowering drugs, steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs, arthritis drugs, antacids, drugs for osteoporosis and otosclerosis. andnumerous other drugs that contain fluoridecan contribute to fluoride toxicity over time.
Person with calcium deficiency or malnourished individuals appear to be more prone to develop dental and skeletal fluorosis.
Fluoridated toothpastes: Indian studies have also shown that absorption of fluoride takes place within minutes after brushing the teeth with fluoridated toothpaste; the saliva from the oral cavity when analyzed for fluoride has also revealed high fluoride content.
Fluoridated beverages.
Fluoride-rich foods such as tea, ocean fish, gelatin, skin of chicken, fluoridated salt, food contaminated with post-harvest fumigants (e.g. sulfuryl fluoride) and pesticides (e.g. sodium aluminium fluoride, Na3AlF6, which may be used on grapes).
Fluoride from any other environmental sources, including cigarette smoke and industrial pollution, e.g. fluoride in dust and fumes from industries such as those manufacturing steel, aluminum, enamel, pottery, glass, bricks, phosphate fertilizer, and others involved with power, welding, water fluoridation plants, refrigeration, rust removal, oil refining, plastics, pharmaceuticals, tooth-paste, chemicals, and automobiles.
Diets rich in fat have been reported to increase deposition of fluoride in bones.
It is also known that fluorosis, in its severe forms, is mostly restricted to a particular climate zone in the world -- the areas with semi-arid tropical conditions. In these areas, the consumption of drinking water is high and the population is more vulnerable to the disease as compared to their counterparts in colder areas with low consumption of water, though the fluoride content of water in both the areas may be the same.
Dental fluorosis can only occur if the fluoride exposure is during the first years of life while the teeth are forming.
In China, fluoride toxicity occurs with: brick tea and food contaminated with fluoride during drying of chilies and corn with coal briquettes.

Mechanism after fluoride intake: Once fluoride enters the body either through the blood vessels in the mouth or through the gastrointestinal route, it reaches the various organs and tissues in the body. Fluoride (F) being an electronegative element, having a negative charge is attracted by positively charged ions like calcium (Ca++). Bone and tooth having highest amount of calcium in the body, attract the maximum amount of fluoride and is deposited as calcium fluorapatite crystals. At the same time, from certain areas in the bone and tooth, the unbound calcium is lost.","All the substances containing fluoride should be avoided during diagnosis. If the symptoms are caused by fluoride, they should diminish markedly within a week and largely disappear within several weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms settle within 15 days.
(l) Physical tests for detection of skeletal fluorosis in endemic areas-
(a)The subject is asked to lift a coin from the floor without bending the knee. A person with skeletal fluorosis would not be able to lift the coin without flexing the large joints of lower extremity (unable to bend without bending knee, test is present in other disease also).
(b) Chin Test: The subject is asked to touch the anterior wall of the chest with the chin. If there is pain or stiffness in the neck, he/she is unable to bend the neck-touching the chest with chin is not possible.
(c) Stretch Test: The individual is made to stretch the arm sideways, fold at elbow and touch the back of the head. When there is pain and stiffness, it would not be possible to touch the back of the head.
(ll)Radiographs: X-ray would reveal increased girth, thickening and density of bone, ligaments calcified. Maximum ill effects of fluoride are detected in the neck, spine, knee, pelvic and shoulder joints. It also affects small joints of the hands and feet.
(lll)SA/GAG test (Sialic acid / Glycosaminoglycan test) -The SA/GAG test is for early detection/diagnosIs of fluoride toxicity. The value of SA/GAG will be reduced in fluorosis and will be significantly elevated in ankylosing spondylitis. The SA/GAG value shows no significant change in arthritis, osteoporosis and spondylosis.
(lV)Estimation of Fluoride content in:

Drinking water- 1.0 ppm (parts per million) is considered as the permissible upper limit for fluoride content in drinking water.
Blood (serum): The serum fluoride levels may or may not be informative as fluoride in circulation never maintains a steady state; it is diverted to other tissues; absorbed by tissues and excreted.
Urine (24 hrs collection if possible): The urinary fluoride level is more useful compared to the blood fluoride level. If the subject has been ingesting food, water, drugs or any other substance contaminated with fluoride, urinary fluoride is bound to be high. (There is another possibility that , when an individual moves out of an endemic area and start living in a non-endemic area, there is a tendency for excreting high levels of fluoride for short duration of time (viz 1-2 months) and the subject will also have less pain in the joints and other regions. History taking is an important task in the diagnosis).

(V)Haemoglobin estimation: for detection of anaemia.","There is no treatment for severe cases of skeletal fluorosis, only efforts can be made towards reducing the disability which has occurred. However, the disease is easily preventable if diagnosed early and steps are taken to prevent intake of excess fluoride through provision of safe drinking water, promote nutrition and avoid foods with high fluoride content. Dental and skeletal fluorosis is irreversible and no treatment exists, the only remedy is prevention by keeping fluoride intake with in safe limits.
Dental fluorosis treatment:

tooth whitening for mild fluorosis cases
composit bonding
Porcelain veneers"
Floppy Eyelid Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/floppy-eyelid-syndrome,"Floppy eyelid syndrome (FES) is frequently an unrecognised cause of chronic, non-infectious unilateral or bilateral papillary conjunctivitis. It is characterised by loose floppy eyelids associated with punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK), ptosis of lateral eyelashes and typical conjunctival changes.
Floppy eyelid syndrome was described initially by Culbertson and Ostler (1981). Prior to this, it was not recognised as a specific entity. The syndrome was seen in overweight male patients with floppy, rubbery, and easily everted upper eyelids. It may be associated with a variable chronic papillary conjunctivitis of the upper palpebral conjunctiva.
It affects patients of both sexes ranging in age from two to eighty years, but it affects more commonly middle-aged obese males. The floppiness of the eyelids is due to laxity of the tarsus. Decrease in tarsal elastin contributes to the laxity of eyelids.
In addition to involvement of anterior segment, FES may also be associated with glaucoma and papilloedema due to raised intracranial pressure.
A number of systemic diseases may be associated with FES, such as diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism and hypertension. These diseases may correlate better with preponderance of patients with obesity in this disorder. Obstructive sleep apnoea appears to be a particular risk, especially for obese males with FES.","The syndrome is characterised by a triad of diffuse papillary conjunctivitis, a loose upper eyelid which everts readily (positive lid eversion sign), and a soft rubbery tarsus which may be folded on itself. It may be associated with lash ptosis, which usually involves lateral lashes of the upper eyelid.
Untreated FES may be associated with

Irritation of eyes.
Matting or discharge from the eyes.
Blepharoptosis and dermatochalasis may result from repetitive mechanical trauma due to lid-to-pillow contact.
Punctate corneal keratopathy.
Infectious keratitis.
Bilateral corneal neovascularisation.
Corneal ulceration.
Corneal scarring.
Recurrent corneal erosion syndrome.
Filamentary keratitis.


There may be ectropion of the lower eyelid as well.","Various causes have been implicated as aetiological factors.

Decrease in the amount of elastin: Studies have shown significant decrease in the amount of elastin within the tarsal plate and eyelid skin. It is probably induced by repeated mechanical stress, associated with eye rubbing or by sleeping habits. Patients with FES consistently sleep face down with their eyes pressed against the pillow. The disorder may be bilateral or unilateral, but there is close correlation of the eye with the side on which the patient preferentially sleeps.
Poor contact of lax eyelid with the globe: Poor contact of lax eyelid with the globe in conjunction with abnormalities of meibomian glands and tear films, may contribute to the syndrome. Tear film abnormalities are characterised by lipid deficiency with consequent rapid rate of evaporation of tears.
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA): Obstructive sleep apnoea may contribute to local eyelid ischaemia which may play a role in development of FES. This ischaemia may be exacerbated by hypoventilation of OSA. These patients demonstrate partial or complete collapse of the airway during inspiration.","Diagnosis depends upon

The identification of a lax, distensible tarsal plate.
Papillary changes of the conjunctiva.
Ready eversion of tarsal plates in classical cases on superior traction of the eyebrow.

Upper eyelid distraction of 14 mm or more is consistent with the diagnosis, as described by Iyengar (2007).

Differential diagnosis
It may be distinguished from conditions like
Allergic conjunctivitis.
Ectropion.
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis.
Giant papillary conjunctivitis.
Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.
Dermatochalasis.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Treatment is directed toward interrupting the eversion of the tarsus during sleep.
Medical therapy:
It consists of

Mechanical shielding: Mechanical shielding of eyelids with tape may prevent eversion.
Sleep mask: Sleep mask help in interrupting lid-pillow contact during sleep.
Topical lubrication: Symptomatic topical lubrication helps in alleviating irritation and discharge from eyes.
Avoid rubbing: Patients should avoid rubbing their eyes.


Surgical therapy:
Surgical procedures to tighten the eyelids may not be successful, unless the face-down sleeping position is resolved. As majority of patients with FES will have OSA, its resolution along with supine sleep position is important.

Horizontal shortening of eyelids: Horizontal shortening of eyelids may be tried. There is tendency for the lids to restretch and evert.
Lateral canthopexy: Lateral canthopexy may be more effective form of shortening eyelid.
Tarsorrhaphy: Patients who fail to respond to horizontal tightening may require tarsorrhaphy to prevent eyelid eversion.

During horizontal tightening, ptosis repair, eyelash repositioning and blepharoplasty may also be performed."
Factitious Keratoconjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/factitious-keratoconjunctivitis,"Factitious Keratoconjunctivitis is a difficult diagnosis to make and is often missed when not suspected. It should be considered in any case in which sustained trauma occurs in poorly explained or suspicious circumstances. The term factitious disorders describe conditions where physical findings are intentionally produced by person to assume sick role.
Factitious disorder most commonly occurs during second or third decade of life, and more often among health professionals. Factitious disease affecting eyes is commonly seen in nasal or inferior quadrant of the eye. Topical anaesthetic abuse is one of the most common self-induced injuries to the eye.
We, as clinician, tend to find aetiology underlying any eye disease. Therefore, self-inflicted injuries often do not draw attention. Self-injuring patients often reach out for help but are incapable of describing what help is required. Failure in diagnosis of such disease may delay therapy to prevent permanent damage.
Factitious disorders must be distinguished from malingering and somatoform disorders. In malingering, in addition to intentionally induced physical features, there is always evidence of external incentive. Malingering may be adaptive as in prisoners of war, and does not necessarily mean psychopathology. Somatoform disorders produce clinical findings which are not fully explained. Somatoform disorders include conditions such as hypochondriasis and hysteria.","Symptoms may be disproportionate to the clinical signs. Patients usually seek multiple medical advises over an extended period of time. These may be with varying complaints and from different treating physicians.
Patient may present with

Dermatitis on eyelids.
Keratoconjunctivitis with features such as redness, photophobia and copious discharge.
Unconcerned attitude of the patient (belle indifférence).","Conjunctival inflammation in factitious keratoconjunctivitis is produced by self-inflicted physical or chemical injury. It may occur in context of a psychiatric illness.
Self-inflicted injury in and around eye is rare and not usually sight threatening in children. However, it may be a warning sign of much more serious problem of physical or sexual abuse.
Factitious keratoconjunctivitis in adults is often associated with complex psychological or emotional problem.
Self-inflicted injury may be in the form of

Chemical injury.
Use of medication.
Mechanical injury such as corneal abrasion or laceration.

Causative agents may include topical anaesthetic agent, acid, or even pieces of chalk.","Diagnosis depends upon clinical features since history of self-inflicted injury may not be available. Differential diagnosis helps in reaching to a conclusive diagnosis.
Patient may show presence of chronic, usually over three weeks, of conjunctivitis having peculiar features such as

Presence of purulent discharge.
Localisation of conjunctivitis, usually in the inferonasal quadrant of the eye which stains with rose bengal dye.
Superior bulbar conjunctiva is usually not involved.
Severe hyperaemia.
Mild chemosis.
Punctate keratopathy.
Linear corneal abrasions.
Persistent corneal epithelial defects.
Presence of pseudodendrites.
Sterile ring infiltrate and hypopyon.
Secondary infection with Candida.
Corneal scarring.
Focal corneal perforation (rare).
Filamentary keratitis.



Differential diagnosis
Factitious keratoconjunctivitis may simulate conditions such as

Mucous fishing syndrome.
Congenital or acquired corneal anaesthesia.
Munchausen syndrome by proxy, which is characterised by a triad of simulated illness, pathological telling of lies (pseudologia fantastica) and doctor shopping (peregrination).
Topical anaesthetic abuse.
Blepharitis.
Dry eye syndrome.
Toxic keratoconjunctivitis.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Other clinical diagnosis should be excluded.
Management depends upon extent of damage and clinical presentation of an individual case. It may require

Patching of eyes.
Bandage soft contact lenses.
Lubricating preservative-free artificial tears.
Topical antibiotic cover to avoid superadded infection of the eye.

Close observation may show clinical improvement in findings.
Confrontation with patient may lead to avoidance and failure to return for follow up.
Psychiatric consultation may be needed.
Sometimes, patient may require hospitalisation.
Patients, refractory to conventional medical therapy, may require surgery such as temporary total tarsorrhaphy.

Prognosis
Prognosis and visual outcome depends upon the extent and severity of self-inflicted damage.
Dramatic improvement in clinical findings is observed when patient is being put under observation for a twenty-four hour period."
Fibromyalgia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia is chronic neurological disorder that involves widespread pain, tenderness, fatigue, and other symptoms. It is common in middle-aged women but can affect patients of either sex and at any age. 2-4 percent of people may be affected by fibromyalgia. The term fibromyalgia means pain in muscles and fibrous tissues (tendons and ligaments).
Fibromyalgia is still considered a medically benign disorder, as it does not cause any serious problem or physical deformities, or loss of life. But it has a profound effect on the quality of life of the patient because it interferes with a person’s ability to perform everyday activities and affects cognitive functioning such as the ability to think, to reason, to remember. The diagnosis can be made with careful examination and exclusion of other diseases having similar symptoms.
There is no cure for the fibromyalgia; support from health professionals can provide positive effects on patients’ quality of life. Health services (general practitioners, specialists, public health facilities, medical insurance companies) can play a key role in helping patients come to terms with the disease; and for that, it is important that all professionals involved in managing fibromyalgia to have specific knoweldge about the disease.","Fibromyalgia is a syndrome combined with several signs and symptoms that includes:
Pain: There are widespread different types of pain in body which are not consistent and may vary in severity and location. There are days when person may not feel pain at all.
Fatigue:People with fibromyalgia often feel tired; even after awakening from long duration of sleep. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea.
Cognitive difficulties: Cognitive difficulties that can occur with fibromyalgia are commonly termed as ""fibro fog"".It can manifest in different ways such as:

short term memory loss
forgetting plans
misplacing objects
becoming easily distracted
difficulty carrying conversations
inability to remember new information

Sometimes difficulty of mental alertness can be more devastating than the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Some patients also may have:

depression or anxiety
migraine or tension headaches
digestive problems: irritable bowel syndrome
gastro-esophageal reflux disease
irritable or overactive bladder
pelvic pain
Temporomandibular disorder

Signs-
Tender points- There are certain points which are tender (pain with pressure).The fibromyalgia tender points are symmetrical; they are present on both sides of the body. These tender points are very small. All of them arearound joints, (but fibromyalgia pain has nothing to do with the joints themselves).
The tender point locations are:

Front lower sides of neck
Upper chest
Inner elbows
Just above inner knees
Back of your head
Top of the shoulders
Upper back (at shoulder blades)
Upper buttock
Hips","The exact cause of fibromyalgia is not clear. It is not an autoimmune, inflammatory, joint, or muscle disorder; though some factors such as spine problem, arthritis, injury, or other type of physical stress even emotional stress may trigger this illness.
More recently, fibromyalgia has been described as ‘central pain amplification disorder’, meaning the volume of pain sensation in the brain is turned up too high. There is abnormal pain processing particularly in the central nervous system rather than from dysfunction in peripheral tissues where pain is perceived. There is a change in the way the body communicates with the spinal cord and brain.
Though genes alone do not cause fibromyalgia, but there may be certain genes that can make people more prone to getting fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia may run in families.","There is no diagnostic test for fibromyalgia; therefore disease is diagnosed by examining the patient, evaluating symptoms, and ruling out otherconditions. There are some conditions that can be confused with fibromyalgia such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatica and other inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Physical findings and blood tests will help the medical expert to differentiate these diseases.
A fibromyalgia diagnosis is often made when a patient has unexplained pain for at least 3 months; and at least 11 of 18 tender points in specific locations are tender (even light pressure can cause pain) (though the presence of tender points is not specific reason for making diagnosis); and no other health problem is detected that could explain the pain and other symptoms.
These tender points should not be confused with trigger points, which are associated with chronic myofascial pain. The primary difference between tender points and trigger points is that trigger points can producereferred pain (they can cause pain in other parts of the body).
When doctor tests tender points for pain, other non-tender places on body called control points are also tested to make sure the reaction of a person about tenderness.","Management of fibromyalgia involves a combination of medications, stress management, exercise and rest with enough sleep.There is no cure for fibromyalgia. However, symptoms can be treated with both non-drug measures and medication based treatments. Many times the best outcomes are achieved by using multiple types of treatments.
Non-Drug Therapies:People with fibromyalgia can use non-drug therapies as well as medicines suggested by their doctors. Following are some non drug therapy measures to manage fibromyalgia:
Patient’s self-care is an important aspect to improving symptoms and daily functions of a person having fibromyalgia. Healthy lifestyle behaviour can reduce pain, increase sleep quality, lessen fatigue and help to cope better with fibromyalgia.
Regular Exercise: It is reported that regular exercise is one of the most effective treatments for fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia who have too much pain or fatigue should begin with walking or other gentle exercise (water aerobics and/or stretching exercises) and build their endurance and intensityslowly. Patients should follow the saying, “Start low, go slow.” It takes time to create a comfortable routine. Just get moving, stay active and don't give up.
Make time to relax each day: Deep-breathing exercises and meditation will help reduce the stress that can bring on symptoms. It’s also important to manage daily schedule with time to rest and relax. Persons with fibromyalgia should avoid making too many commitments that can make them fatigue.
Set a regular sleep pattern: Patient should go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Getting enough sleep will help body to repair itself, physically and mentally. Avoid daytime napping and limit caffeine intake, which can disrupt sleep. For those who smoke, they should stop smoking (nicotine is a stimulant and aggravates sleep problems).
Look forward, not backward: Person with fibromyalgia should focus on tasks need to do to get better, not what caused the illness. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day.
Keep dietary habits healthy: Person should try to eat a healthy, balanced diet. Proper nutrition can help body stay healthy and provide a constant supply of energy and nutrients so that symptoms of fibromyalgia may not get worse.
Educate yourself about illness; and share the information with family, friends and co-workers.
Moist heat can be used to relieve deep muscle pain and stiffness like moist heating pad, warm bath or shower.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT and related treatments, such as mindfulness, can help patients learn symptom reduction skills that lessen pain. CBT is based on understanding that how thoughts and behaviours can affect pain and other symptoms. Mindfulness is a non-spiritual meditation practice that cultivates present moment awareness and has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of fibromyalgia.
Other complementary and alternative therapies (sometimes called CAM or integrative medicine), such as acupuncture, chiropractic and massage therapy, yoga and tai chi can be useful to manage fibromyalgia symptoms (though many of these treatments have not been well tested in patients with fibromyalgia).
Manage risk factors-It is important to address risk factors and triggers for fibromyalgia including sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, and mood problems such as stress, anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. This may require involvement of other specialists such as a sleep medicine doctor, psychiatrist.
Drug therapy-
Initial management of fibromyalgia involves patient education with focus on non-pharmacological therapies. Though in non-responsive patients, pharmacological therapies should be added especially to those with sleep or mood disturbances.
Drugs like pregabalin, gabapentin (which work by blocking the over activity of nerve cells involved in pain transmission) may be used for management of pain of fibromyalgia. These medicines may cause dizziness, sleepiness, swelling and weight gain.
The antidepressants duloxetine and milnacipran, which are used to relieve pain, fatigue, and sleep problems, are generally used at lower doses than for treatment of depression.
Several medications are avoided or used carefully. Opioids, hypnotics, anxiolytics, and certain skeletal-muscle relaxants are used with caution because of the potential for abuse and the risk of worsening fatigue and cognitive dysfunction.
Over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or naproxen are not effective for fibromyalgia pain. These drugs may be useful to treat the pain triggers of fibromyalgia such as arthritis.
For sleep problems, some of the medicines that treat pain also improve sleep. These include cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalin. Sleeping medicines like zolpidem or benzodiazepine medications are not recommended in patients with fibromyalgia.
Vitamin Dsupplements may reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia who are deficient in thisvitamin."
Female genital mutilation,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/female-genital-mutilation,"Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a global problem which affects girls and women worldwide. Although it is internationally recognized as a violation of human rights and legislation to prohibit the procedure has been put in place in many countries, the practice is still being reported.
Female genital mutilation (FGM) includes procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. FGM comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons1.
Every year about 3 million girls and women are at risk of FGM2. FGM can have a negative effect on several aspects of a girl’s or woman’s life, including her physical, mental and sexual health and her relationship with her husband or partner and other close family members.
FGM is mostly carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15. More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to the practice in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where FGM is more common3.
FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children. The practice also violates a person's rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.
Human Rights violated by the practice of FGM4:

Right to the highest attainable standard of health
Right to life and physical integrity, including freedom from violence
Right to freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
Right to equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex
Rights of the child

The practice is mostly carried out by traditional circumcisers, who often play other central roles in communities, such as attending childbirths. In many settings, health care providers perform FGM due to the erroneous belief that the procedure is safer when medicalized. WHO strongly urges health professionals not to perform such procedures.
In 2008, the World Health Assembly passed resolution (WHA61.16) on the elimination of FGM, emphasizing the need for concerted action in all sectors - health, education, finance, justice and women's affairs. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on the elimination of female genital mutilation3.
In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) includes a target under Goal 5 to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and FGM/C, by the year 2030.","Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths.
Immediate complications can include:

severe pain
excessive bleeding (severe haemorrhage can lead to anaemia))
genital tissue swelling
fever
urinary problems
infections e.g., tetanus
wound healing problems
injury to surrounding genital tissue
shock
haemorrhage and infection can be severe enough to cause death.

Long-term effects of FGM can include:

urinary problems (painful urination, urinary tract infections);
vaginal problems (discharge, itching, bacterial vaginosis and other infections);
menstrual problems (painful menstruations, difficulty in passing menstrual blood, etc.);
scar tissue and keloid;
sexual problems (pain during intercourse, decreased satisfaction, etc.);
increased risk of childbirth complications (difficult delivery, excessive bleeding, caesarean section, need to resuscitate the baby, etc.) and newborn deaths;
need for later surgeries: for example, the FGM procedure that seals or narrows a vaginal opening (type 3) needs to be cut open later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth (deinfibulation).
psychological problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc.). The psychological stress of the procedure may trigger behavioural disturbances in children, closely linked to loss of trust and confidence in caregivers. In the longer term, women may suffer feelings of anxiety and depression.

FGM has no health benefits, and it harms girls and women in many ways. It involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue, and interferes with the natural functions of girls' and women's bodies1,2.
 FGM: No health benefits, only harm","Who is at risk?
Procedures for FGM are mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and adolescence, and occasionally on adult women. More than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk for FGM annually1.
The practice is most common in the western, eastern, and north-eastern regions of Africa, in some countries the Middle East and Asia, as well as among migrants from these areas. FGM is therefore a global concern2.
Cultural and social factors for performing FGM:
FGM is carried out for various cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities in the mistaken belief that it will benefit the girl in some way such as- a rite of passage into womanhood, to preserve a girl’s virginity until marriage. Following are some reasons:
Respect for tradition: Community members, including the women see it as a sign of respect towards the elder members of the community.
Rite of passage: In many cultures, FGM constitutes an important rite of passage into adulthood for girls. It may be considered a necessary step towards being viewed as a respectable adult woman.
Social convention: Those who adhere to the practice may be better accepted in their communities, while those who do not may face condemnation, harassment and exclusion.
Enhance fertility: In some practicing communities, women and men believe that if a woman is not cut she will not be able to become pregnant or she may face difficulties during labour.
Marriageability: There is often an expectation that men will marry only women who have undergone FGM. The desire and pressure to be married, and the economic and social security that may come with marriage, can perpetuate the practice in some settings.
Ensure virginity, chastity and faithfulness: FGM is believed to safeguard a girl’s or woman’s virginity prior to marriage and ensure fidelity after marriage.
Cleanliness and beauty: In some communities, FGM is performed in order to make girls “clean” and beautiful. Cleanliness may refer to the body, but it may also refer to spiritual purity.
Femininity: The removal of genital parts that are considered masculine (i.e. the clitoris) is considered to make girls more feminine, respectable and beautiful.
Religion: Some communities believe that FGM is a religious requirement, and some religious leaders may promote the practice, even though it is not mentioned in any major religious texts3,4.
Medicalization of FGM:
Medicalization of FGM refers to situations in which FGM is practised by any category of health-care provider, whether in a public or a private clinic, at home or elsewhere. It also includes the procedure of re-infibulation at any time in a woman’s life.
(Re-infibulation: The procedure to narrow the vaginal opening in a woman after she has been deinfibulated (such as after childbirth); also known as re-suturing2.
Types of FGM
Female genital mutilation is classified into 4 major types:

Type 1:Often referred to asclitoridectomy, this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals), and in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris).
Type 2:Often referred to asexcision, this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without excision of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).
Type 3 (infibulation):Often referred to as infibulation. This is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy).
Type 4:This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area2.","Health-care providers working in regions where FGM is a common practice and those seeing patients from these regions should always include direct questions about FGM-related gynaecological and urogenital complications when taking a medical history from their female patients1. As girls and women living with FGM often do not seek care for such type of symptoms until the symptoms are advanced or cannot be hidden.
Once it has been established that the girl or woman has undergone any type of FGM, this information and the subsequent clinical examination should be done with proper care. Following tests may be performed according to the symptoms:

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections
Urine examination when symptoms suggestive for urinary tract infections
Pelvic ultrasound to confirm the cause in case of menstrual irregularities.","Health-care providers play an important role in the treatment and care of the girls and women around the world living with female genital mutilation1,3.
Girls and women gone through FGM, may have symptoms related to gynecological problems menstrual problems, pelvic pain, painful intercourse, difficult labour, depression, anxiety and other problems and they should consult health care provider in their areas.
Many women who have undergone FGM have greater risk of obstetric complications, hence adequate and timely antenatal care and birth plan in advance for child birth should be taken to ensure the healthiest possible outcome for the woman and the baby.
Sometimes surgery called deinfibulation may be required in women living with Type III FGM to re-open the vaginal introitus. It is recommended for preventing and treating obstetric complications in women living with type III FGM1.
In the case of asymptomatic women living with FGM who request surgery, interventions are performed on the basis of clinical judgement, the management of these cases should always start with the least invasive procedure available as several potential adverse events are associated with surgical interventions.
Cognitive behavior therapy(CBT): A type of psychological therapy based on the idea that feelings are affected by thinking and beliefs. If unchecked, these thoughts and beliefs can lead to unhelpful behaviours. CBT typically has a cognitive component (i.e. helping the person develop the ability to identify and challenge unrealistic negative thoughts) and a behavioural component.
CBT may be considered in women, girls who are diagnosed with psychiatric problems such as anxiety disorder, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The therapy should be provided by competent individuals (trained and supervised)1,2."
Gangrene,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gangrene,"Gangrene is a condition that arises when a considerable mass of body tissue dies (necrosis) . This may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. Gangrene is primarily caused due to reduced blood supply to the affected tissues that leads to cell death. Diseases like diabetes and long-term smoking increases the risk of gangrene. It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers and hands (the extremities).
Types of gangrene:
Dry gangrene: Dry gangrene begins at the distal part of the limb due to ischemia (restricted supply of blood), and often appears in the toes and feet of elderly patients due to arteriosclerosis and thus, it is also known as senile gangrene. Dry gangrene is generally seen due to arterial occlusion. As there is limited putrefaction and bacteria fail to survive, dry gangrene spreads slowly until it reaches the point where the blood supply is adequate to keep tissue viable. The affected part is dry, shrunken and dark reddish-black, like mummified flesh.
Wet gangrene: Wet gangrene occurs in moist tissues and organs such as the mouth, bowel, lungs, cervix, and vulva. Bed sores occurring on body parts such as the sacrum, buttocks, and heels are also classified as wet gangrene infections. Wet gangrene is characterized by numerous bacteria and generally has a poor prognosis (compared to dry gangrene) due to septicaemia. In wet gangrene, the tissue is infected by microorganisms like Clostridium perfringens or Bacillus fusiformis that causes the tissues to swell and emit a foetid smell. Wet gangrene usually develops rapidly due to blockage of venous (mainly) and/or arterial blood flow. The affected part is saturated with stagnant blood,that promotes rapid growth of bacteria.
Gas gangrene: Gas gangrene is a bacterial infection that produce gas within tissues. It is the most severe form of gangrene usually caused by Clostridium perfringens bacteria. Infection spreads rapidly as the gases produced by bacteria expand and infiltrate healthy tissues in the vicinity.Gas gangrene is generally treated as a medical emergency as it quickly spreads to the surrounding tissues.","Dry gangrene which is the most common type of gangrene, usually manifests in the following form.
• Firstly, the affected part turns red
• Then it becomes cold, pale and numb (though some people might experience pain).
•Furthermore, the body part may begin to change colour from red to brown to black without treatment. The dead tissue may shrivel up and fall away from the surrounding healthy tissue.
Wet gangrene progresses much faster than dry gangrene. Its symptoms include:
• Swelling and redness of the affected body part
• Pain which can often be severe
• Foul-smelling discharge of pus from a sore in skin
• Affected area will change colour from red to brown to black
The symptoms of Gas gangrene are as follows:
• Feeling of heaviness followed by severe pain
• In most cases of gas gangrene, pressing skin near the affected area will produce a crackling sound caused by a build-up of gas;producing the feeling of crushing fine tinfoil.","Gangrene is caused when a body part loses its blood supplydue to an injury or an underlying disease. The conditions most commonly responsible for causing gangrene are as follows:

Diabetes
Blood vessel disease such as arteriosclerosis causing hardening of the arteries, in arms or legs
Suppressed immune system (for example, from HIV or chemotherapy)
Surgery
Due to infection or ischemia, such as by the bacteria Clostridium perfringens or bythrombosis (a blocked blood vessel).","Clinical tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis of gangrene. These include:

Blood tests– An increase or decrease in the number of white blood cells can indicate infection.
Tissue culture– A small sample of fluid (or tissue) from the affected area can be tested for bacteria. This test is called a Gram stain. Bacteria are stained with a dye and examined under a microscope. The test is also useful for determining the most effective type of antibiotic to treat the infection.
Blood culture– A sample of infected blood is removed and placed in a warm environment to encourage the growth of bacteria.
Imaging tests– A range of imaging tests, such as X-rays, MRI scans (where radio waves are used to produce an image of the inside of your body) or a computerized tomography (CT) scan can be used to confirm the presence and spread of gangrene. These tests can also be used to study blood vessels in order to identify the blockages.
Surgery– Surgical examination may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of gas gangrene.","Although Gangrene can be managed by its symptomatic treatment, yet it is also necessary to diagnose and treat the underlying cause. The symptomatic treatment is as follows: 
Infection: Serious infections are usually treated with antibiotics.
Debridement: Debridement is the surgical removal of the dead tissue that results from gangrene.
Vascular surgery:Vascular surgeries can be used to restore the blood flow either by Angioplasty or Bypass surgery.

Angioplasty – Where a tiny balloon is placed into a narrow, or blocked, artery and is inflated to open up the vessel. A small metal tube, known as a stent, may also be inserted into the artery to prevent it from getting closed.
Bypass surgery – Where the surgeon redirects the flow of blood and bypasses the blockage by connecting (grafting) one of the veins to a healthy part of an artery.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: An alternative treatment for some forms of gangrene is hyperbaric oxygen therapy. As part of the therapy, a specially designed chamber that also contains a plastic hood filled with pure oxygen, is filled with pressurized air. The plastic hood is then placed over the damaged body part."
Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/stomach/gastro-esophageal-reflux-disease-gerd,"Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic symptom of mucosal damage that is caused due to entry of acid from stomach into the esophagus. The esophagusis a long tube of muscle that runs from mouth to the stomach. Normally once the food is chewed, it goes from mouth to the esophagus and then into the stomach, where it is mixed with the acidic gastric juice for digestion. The esophagus and the stomach are separated by a sphincter (lower esophageal sphincter), which is a band of muscular fibers that close the valve in order to prevent the food or gastric acids from going back to the esophagus.","The most-common symptoms of GERD are:

Heartburn
Regurgitation
Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia)

Heart burn: Heartburn is a burning pain or a feeling that develops just below the breastbone. The pain is usually worse after eating, or while bending over or lying down.
Regurgitation: Expulsion of acid usually causes an unpleasant, sour taste at the top of your throat or the back of the mouth.
Dysphagia: Dysphagia is usually characterized by difficulty in swallowing.","GERD usually manifests due to problem with the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) muscle.The LES is located at the bottom of the esophagus, the tube that runs from the back of throat to stomach.
The most common risk factors of GERD are as follows:

Obesity
Consuming caffeine: in form of chocolates, coffee.
Pregnancy
Having diet rich in fatty acids
Stress
Hiatus Hernia (It occurs when part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm)","Diagnosis of GERD is uaually accompanied with an accurate symptomatic history. It can be diagnosed by procedures like Endoscopy, Barium swallow and Manometry.
Endoscopy: It is a procedure in which fibre-optic tube is inserted into the stomach. To confirm a diagnosis of GERD, the endoscope is inserted into mouth and down into the throat. The procedure is usually done while the patient is awake, and may be given a sedative to relax. An endoscopy is used to check whether the surface of esophagus has been damaged by stomach acid. It can also rule out more serious conditions that can also cause heartburn, such as stomach cancer.
Barium swallow: If there are symptoms of dysphagia then patient may be referred for a test known as barium swallow. The barium swallow test is one of the most effective ways of assessing the swallowing ability and finding exactly where the problems are occurring. The test can often identify blockages or problems with the muscles used during swallowing.
Manometry: Manometry is used to assess how well lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is working by measuring pressure levels inside the sphincter muscle. During the test, patient will be asked to swallow some food and liquid to check the proper functioning of LES.
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose you should consult your physician.","Self-care is very essential for treating GERD. It includes:

Losing weight if patient is obese
Eating less and more frequently
Be aware of triggers that leads to GERD like caffeine, tobacco.

Medications: A number of medication groups are there like:

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs)
H2-receptor antagonists
Prokinetics

Surgery: The standard surgical treatment for severe GERD is the Nissen fundoplication. In this procedure, the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent acid reflux and also to repair a hiatal hernia.
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose you should consult your physician."
Glaucoma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/glaucoma,"What is Glaucoma?
Glaucoma is a term used to describe a group of diseases of the eye characterized by progressive and irreversible damage to the optic nerve (nerve of the eye responsible for vision) and which if untreated can lead to blindness. Though raised pressure of the eye (pressure maintained by fluid in the eye) is an important risk factor, a few individuals can develop glaucoma even with normal pressure of the eye.
Types of glaucoma
Glaucoma can be classified into four basic types based on the event initiating damage. They include

Primary open-angle glaucoma
Primary angle-closure glaucoma
Developmental glaucoma (which affects children)
Secondary glaucoma (which occurs due to other disorders of the eye or the body )

The disease burden
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world accounting for upto 8% of total blindness. In India , glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness with atleast 12 million people affected and nearly 1.2 million people blind from the disease. More than 90 percent of cases of glaucoma remain undiagnosed in the community.
The content of this module has been validated by Dr Tanuj Dada, RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi on 17/3/2015.","Primary open angle glaucoma presents as a chronic disease and usually has no symptoms in its early stages and the vision remains normal. As the optic nerve is more damaged, peripheral (side) vision is lost progressively till only the central vision is left resulting in tunnel vision (as if looking through the end of a narrow tunnel).
Primary angle closure glaucoma can present either as a chronic disease as said above or as an acute attack. The symptoms of an acute attack include sudden blurring of vision, pain in the eyes, headache, nausea, vomiting and seeing rainbow like rings around lights. 
Secondary glaucoma result from other predisposing conditions of the eye or body and may be asymptomatic or present with the symptoms of predisposing conditions like trauma, uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye) and so on.
Developmental glaucoma affects children. It can present with large eyes, whitening of the cornea (front part of the eye), excessive tearing, sensitivity to light (closure of eyes on light exposure), jerky movements of the eyes and squinting of the eyes (condition in which one of the eyes turns inwards or outwards as the other eye looks forward).","Glaucoma is of multifactorial etiology and raised pressure of the eye is the most important among them and the only modifiable risk factor. As already mentioned, though raised eye pressure is a risk factor, glaucoma can occur even in individuals with normal pressure. The most common abnormality of the eye leading to raised pressure of the eye is an abnormal drainage angle (angle is a structure of the eye where the fluid produced inside the eye exits). This abnormality of the angle causes obstruction to the flow of the fluid which accumulates inside the eye and causes pressure on the optic nerve leading to progressive damage and loss of vision. 
Who is at risk?
Although glaucoma can affect anyone in any age group, some individuals are at higher risk than others. Common risk factors include elevated pressure of the eye, age over 40 years, individuals with a family history of glaucoma, use of steroid-containing medications (eye drops/ pills/inhalers/ skin creams), those with higher refractive error (power) of the eyes , patients with history of blunt eye injury, history of hypertension and diabetes.","The diagnosis of glaucoma is based on a review of history pertaining to the above said symptoms and risk factors, a comprehensive eye examination and several tests to support the diagnosis. Tests which are used in the diagnosis of glaucoma include – measurement of pressure of the eye using an instrument called tonometer, a look at the optic nerve head with an ophthalmoscope or stereoscopic evaluation on the slit lamp with a 90D lens, evaluation of the drainage system – anterior chamber angle of eye using an instrument called the gonioscope, testing of field of vision of each eye using an instrument known as the perimeter, measurement of thickness of cornea with a pachymeter. Specialized tests done for early detection of glaucoma and follow up include photography of the optic nerve , optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry and confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope.","Glaucoma management aims at maintaining the vision related quality of life of the patient throughout his/her lifetime with minimal possible medications at a sustainable cost. The treatment helps to control the disease process so that further damage to the optic nerve can be prevented. There is no cure for glaucoma and treatment cannot restore visual loss but only prevent further deterioration. In the current day practice, reduction of pressure of the eye remains the only modifiable risk factor. Hence the management of glaucoma revolves around the effective control of pressure of the eye with three modalities :
Medical therapy with ocular hypotensive medications, laser therapy and glaucoma surgery.
The most important consideration in the management is that once a diagnosis of glaucoma is made, treatment and regular follow-ups are required lifelong.
Medical management
Medical management remains the first line of treatment in most of the glaucomas. These medications either decrease the secretion of fluid of the eye or increase its exit through the drainage angle. These agents are available as either eye drops or pills. Currently, following medicines are available to control pressure of the eye. They include- prostaglandin analogues, beta adrenergic blockers, alpha adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, parasympathomimetic agents and hyperosmotic agents.
Patients who are prescribed with these eye drops have to observe the following precautions.

The drops have to be instilled as advised by the doctor. Failure to instill drops as prescribed will lead to fluctuations in pressure of the eye and damage to the optic nerve. Probably the best way to put drops is to schedule the instillation with a daily activity like brushing teeth, breakfast or dinner. 
To prevent the drops from spilling around the eye, the patient has to widely open the lids and directly look into the tip of the dropper and instill only one drop at a time.
To minimize the absorption into the bloodstream and prevent untoward side effects on the body, the eye has to be closed for one or two minutes and the eyelid pressed gently at the corner of the eyes near to nose.
Patients prescribed with more than one type of eye drop at one time, have to maintain a gap of 5-10 minutes between two different drop instillation.   
The drops need to be instilled even during the time of travel or during hospital visits.

Laser Therapy
The initial management of primary angle closure disease is laser iridotomy (making a small hole in the iris to bypass pupillary block) usually done with a YAG laser. Laser trabeculoplasty can be performed to lower IOP in patients with Primary open angle glaucoma.
Surgical management
Surgical therapy is required in patients who are intolerant to medical therapy or in whom medical therapy is considered ineffective to control pressure of the eye. Surgical therapy like the medical therapy does not improve the lost visual function, but help to prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Some cases may require continuation of eye drops after surgery for better control of pressure of the eye.

Filtration surgery – this is the most commonly practiced glaucoma surgery for controlling raised pressures. This surgery aims to create a new channel for the exit of eye fluid, bypassing the usual route of drainage i.e. the angle and created subconjunctival filtration.
Glaucoma drainage devices – they are used in patients with previously failed filtration surgeries and also in some patients with advanced secondary glaucomas. These procedures involve insertion of a small tube into the eye which is used to facilitate the drainage of the eye fluid from the eye.
Cyclodestructive procedures – in a painful blind eye , diode laser cyclophotocoagulation or cyclocryotherapy is performed to permanently reduce aqueous formation by the ciliary body and give the patient symptomatic relief."
Goitre,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/endocrinal/thyroid-parathyroid/goitre,"The term “goitre” simply refers to the abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, just in front of the windpipe (trachea). It produces thyroid hormones, which helps to regulate the body's metabolism (the process that turns food into energy).A swelling of thyroid gland can further lead to a swelling of the neck or larynx (voice box).
Goitre is also known as Iodine deficiency disorder as Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of prevalence of goitre. It is estimated that more than 1.5 billion people in the world are at risk from iodine deficiency disorders out of which about 200 million people reside in India.
Types of goitre:There are two different types of goitre:

Diffuse small goitre, where entire thyroid gland enlarges to a larger size and feels smooth to the touch
Nodular goitre, where certain sections, or ""nodules"", of thyroid gland enlarge and feel lumpy to the touch","The main symptom of goitre is swelling of the thyroid gland which causes a lump to develop in the throat. An enlarged thyroid gland can put pressure on trachea (wind pipe) and oesophagus (food tube), this can lead to breathing difficulties, cough, hoarseness of voice, difficulty in swallowing specially with solid foods.
Symptoms associated with conditions like hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism:
Hyperthyroidism:

Weight loss
Increased appetite
Heat intolerance.

Hypothyroidism:

Weight gain
Constipation
Cold intolerance
Fatigue
Dry and scaly skin","The most common cause of goitre is Iodine deficiency. It is one of the leading causes of hypothyroidism. 
Hyperthyroidism (Overactive thyroid gland): Goitre can develop if the thyroid gland becomes overactive (hyperthyroidism), leading to too much thyroid hormones being produced. Increased hormone production will over-stimulate the thyroid gland and causes it to enlarge.The leading cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. Graves' disease causes immune system (the body’s natural defense system) to send antibodies (proteins that fight infections) to the thyroid gland. The antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland, causing an increased amount of thyroid hormones to be released.
Hyporthyroidism (Underactive thyroid gland): Goitre can also develop if the thyroid gland becomes underactive (hypothyroidism). Underactive thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, the body will stimulate it to produce more. This can cause the thyroid gland to enlarge. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease causing hypothyroidism.","Physical examination: Examination of the swelling will help the physician to diagnose goitre.
A diffuse small goitre, where entire thyroid gland swells up
A nodular goitre, where certain sections, or ""nodules"" of thyroid gland swell up.
Thyroid function tests: Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be diagnosed by testing the levels of thyroid hormones in blood. Doctor measures hormones Thyroxine and Triidothyronine secreted by the thyroid gland and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a chemical released by the pituitary gland that triggers hormone production in the thyroid.
Hypothyroidism: Can be diagnosed with low levels of thyroid hormone and higher quantities of TSH circulating in blood, as body attempts to increase production of thyroid hormones.
Hyperthyroidism: The reverse is true with hyperthyroidism, in which TSH levels are below normal and circulating thyroid-hormone levels are high such as Graves’ disease.
To determine the cause ofhyperthyroidism, doctors often do other blood tests looking at certain thyroid antibodies. Raised levels of these antibodies can enable the doctor to pinpoint the cause of an overactive thyroid.
Ultrasound: Doctor may advice either a normal ultrasound scan of neck or a radioactive iodide uptake scan. In radioactive iodide test the doctor uses a special film to create a picture showing the exact location of the radioactive iodide in thyroid gland. Nodules that appear suddenly are typically fluid-filled cysts and are often benign. They can be evaluated with a non-invasive ultrasound examination. 
Information provided here is just for understanding of health. For more queries consult the physician .","The management of Goitre will depend upon whether the patient is suffering from hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Hypothryroidism:If diagnosis reveals an underactive thyroid gland, treatment involves using a synthetic (man-made) hormone to replicate normal thyroid function. This is called hormone therapy. The synthetic hormone, which is called levothyroxine, it is taken orally (by mouth), usually once a day.
Hyperthyroidism:An overactive thyroid gland can be cured by thinoamides. Thionamides are drugs that help to reduce the amount of thyroid hormones produced by thyroid gland.
Radioactive Iodine:Radioactive iodine is another treatment for an overactive thyroid gland that is taken orally (by mouth). When the iodine reaches thyroid gland, it destroys the thyroid cells and reduces the size of the goitre. However, the treatment may cause thyroid gland to become underactive.
Iodine supplements:The regular consumption of iodated salt provides protection from goitre due to hypothytyroidism.
Surgery:If goitre is interferes with breathing, or swallowing, and has not responded to other forms of treatment, surgery may be required to remove part, or all, of your thyroid gland.

Gonorrhea,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gonorrhea,"It is a common human sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhea. It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract, mouth, or anus. Gonorrhea generally spreads during vaginal, oral, or anal sexual encounter with an infected partner. A pregnant woman can pass it to her baby during childbirth. The usual symptoms in men are burning with urination and penile discharge. Women, on the other hand, are asymptomatic half the time or have vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. In both men and women if gonorrhea is left untreated, it may spread locally causing epididymitis or pelvic inflammatory disease or throughout the body, affecting joints and heart valves.","Men: Men who contract gonorrhoea may experience symptoms like:
 
  An unusual white, yellow or green discharge from the tip of the penis
 
  Pain or a burning sensation during passing urine
 
  Inflammation (swelling) of the foreskin
 
  Pain or tenderness in the testicles or prostate gland (though is rare)

 Women:In women, symptoms of gonorrhea can include:
 
  An unusual thick discharge from the vagina, which may be green or yellow in color
 
  Pain during passing urine
 
  Pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area (this is less common)
 
  Bleeding between periods or heavier periods (this is less common)

 Men and women:Both men and women can also catch gonorrhoea at other sites of the body. These include infection in the:
 
  Rectum causing pain, discomfort or discharge in and around anal region
 
  Throat, which does not usually have any symptoms
 
  Eyes, which can cause pain, swelling, irritation and discharge (conjunctivitis)","Gonorrhoea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The infection is transmitted from one person to another through vaginal, oral or anal sex. The bacteria are usually found in discharge from the penis and vaginal fluid of infected men and women. Pregnant women can spread gonorrhoea to the baby during birth. This can lead to newborn baby having an infection of the eyes (conjunctivitis), which can lead toblindnessif not treated.","Gonorrhea is diagnosed with gram stain or with culture of the bacteria, however newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based testing methods are becoming more common.
 For further diagnosis and confirmation, please consult your physician.","It is important to receive treatment for gonorrhea quickly. Gonorrhea can be treated with a single dose of antibiotics, usually one of the following:
 
  Ceftriaxone
 
  Cefixime
 
  Spectinomycin
 
  
   Partner should also get treatment for gonorrhea, even if he/she has no signs or symptoms.
 

 For treatment purpose please consult your physician."
Guillain-Barré syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/guillain-barr-syndrome,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The syndrome is named after the French physicians Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, who described it in 1916. It is also called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP).
GBS is an autoimmune disorder in which a person’s own immune system attacks healthy nerve cells in peripheral nervous system. The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement and nerves that transmit feelings of pain, temperature and touch. This leads to muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling and sometimes paralysis.
Most people recover fully from GBS, but some people have long-term nerve damage. 3%-5% of GBS patients may die from complications, which include paralysis of the muscles that control breathing, blood infection, lung clots or cardiac arrest.
The cause of this condition is unknown, but it’s typically triggered by an infectious illness, such as the gastrointestinal infection or a lung infection. Few countries from Europe and Asia have reported familial occurrence of GBS (42 GBS patients found from 20 families). In a hospital based study from South India among 150 GBS cases reported during 10 years period, 2 cases belonged to a single familya.
According to WHO overall incidence of GBS is 0.4 to 4.0 people per 100 000 per year. People of all ages can be affected, but it is more common in adults and in males.
During 2015 and 2016, nine countries and territories(El Salvador, French Polynesia, Martinique, Colombia, Suriname, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Panama, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS casesb. Researchers are studying a potential link between the surge in GBS cases and Zika virus infection. Zika virus is not yet proven to be the cause of the increased GBS incidence in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname or Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).","Symptoms usually start with numbness or tingling in the fingers and toes. Over several days, muscle weakness develops in the legs and arms. The lower limbs are usually involved before the upper limbs. Weakness is ascending and symmetrical in nature. The weakness may progress to the arms, face (In 45%-75% of patients III-VII and IX-XII cranial nerves are involved), and muscles of respiration (the chest muscles are affected in 20%-25% of cases).
The symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome include:

tingling or prickly sensations in fingers and toes
muscle weakness in legs that travels to upper body and gets worse over time
difficulty in walking steadily
difficulty in moving eyes or face, talking, chewing, or swallowing
severe lower back pain
loss of bladder control
fast heart rate
difficulty in breathing
paralysis

Most people recover fully from the disease; however some cases continue to experience weakness.","The etiology of GBS is not completely understood. It is not a contagious disorder.
About two-thirds of people with GBS develop it soon after they have been suffered with diarrhea or a respiratory infection. This suggests that the disorder may be triggered by an improper immune response to the previous illness.
Infections that may trigger GBS include:

Campylobacter jejuni which can cause gastrointestinal infection. This bacterium is one of the most common risk factors for GBS.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Epstein Barr virus
Mycoplasma
Varicella zoster virus
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue, or influenza
Less commonly vaccinations, surgical procedures, and trauma have been reported to trigger the development of GBS.

GBS can affect person of any age group, however the incidence of GBS increases with age. People older than 50 years are at greatest risk for developing GBS.","Guillain-Barré syndrome is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to other neurological disorders. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, findings on neurological examination including diminished or loss of deep-tendon reflexes.
Routine blood tests are done, to exclude other diseases with similar symptoms and for better assessment of functional status and prognosis.
Specific tests are required to identify the cause of trigger of GBS.
The following tests are used to confirm a diagnosis of GBS-

Lumber puncture (Spinal tap) - People with Guillain- Barré syndrome has higher-than-normal levels of protein in their cerebrospinal fluid without an elevation in white blood cells. The increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein reflects the widespread inflammation of the nerve roots.

Electromyography-An electromyography is a nerve function test. It reads electrical activity from the muscles and distinguishes whether muscle weakness is caused by nerve damage or muscle damage.

Nerve Conduction Tests-Nerve conduction studies may be used to test how well nerves and muscles respond to small electrical stimuli.

Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scanning of the spine may be helpful in excluding mechanical causes of myelopathy.

On 25th February 2016, under Identification and management of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the context of Zika virus, WHO has recommended using Brighton criteria as the case definition of GBS, so that standardized information may be available for epidemiologic purposes(not as a criterion for treatment). This criterion is based on presenting clinical findings and ancillary testing including neurophysiology and lumbar puncture findings. Patients are categorized as level-1 (the highest level of diagnostic certainty) to level -3(the lowest level of diagnostic certainty)*.","The goal of treatment is to lessen the severity of symptoms and maintain vital functions normal while nervous system recovers.

GBS patients are usually hospitalized so that they can be monitored closely.
A multidisciplinary approach is required in the acute phase, combining supportive and disease-modifying therapy (plasma exchange or high-dose immunoglobulin [IVIG]).

(a)Supportive therapy- 

Respiratory management-Respiratory status should be monitored in all patients. Up to 30% of patients need ventilatory support or airway protection.

Cardiovascular management-Haemodynamic monitoring of pulse and blood pressure should be started early. Hypotensive / Hypertensive episodesmay be managed accordingly.

Prophylaxis for prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)- There is increased risk of DVT (formation of blood clots) in DBS patients due to immobility and hypercoagulability (increased tendency toward blood clotting from treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin).Medication and support stockings may be used in non-ambulatory patients until they are able to walk independently.

Pain management-Safe and effective drugs are required for pain management in acute phase.

(b) Immunotheraphy:Immunotherapy comprises IVIG or plasma exchange. 

Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) - High doses of immunoglobulin can help to block the antibodies causing GBS. (Immunoglobulin contains normal, healthy antibodies from donors). It should begin within two weeks from the onset of symptoms.

Plasmapheresis (Plasma Exchange) - Plasmapheresisis a process that filters the blood and removes harmful antibodies. Plasma exchange is most beneficial when initiated within 7-14 days from the onset of the disease.

(c) Rehabilitation services:

Rehabilitation is started in the form of physiotherapy in the acute phase of the disease. It comprises gentle strengthening involving isometric, isotonic, isokinetic, and manual resistive and progressive resistive exercises. It should be focused on proper limb positioning, posture, orthotics, and nutrition."
Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/giant-papillary-conjunctivitis,"Giant (mechanically induced) Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC), the severe form of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis, may be secondary to a variety of mechanical stimuli of the tarsal conjunctiva. Since GPC is predominantly associated with the use of contact lenses (CLs), the disease is also referred to as contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis (CLPC).
GPC is an inflammatory condition seen in upper tarsal conjunctiva, initially reported by Spring in 1974 (Spring TF, Reaction to hydrophilic lenses, Med J Aust 1974; 1:449-50). A papillary reaction, similar to the one with allergic conjunctivitis, occurs in soft contact lens wearers. Allansmith and colleagues further detailed the syndrome, suggesting that it may be immunologic in origin, with the proteinaceous deposits on the contact lenses, serving as the antigen (Allansmith MR, Korb DR, Greiner JV, et. al. Giant papillary conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers. Am J Ophthalmol 1977; 83:697-708).
GPC, a non-infectious inflammatory disorder was originally named for the presence of giant papillae (1.0mm or greater in diameter) along the upper tarsal surface. However, papillae measuring 0.3mm or greater are now considered abnormal and a feature of this condition.
GPC is most often associated with wearing soft (hydro-gel) contact lenses, though it can occur with any type of contact lens. The contact lens type, material, wearing schedule, cleaning process and length of time lenses have been worn contribute to the severity of the disease, with soft lens wearers suffering from more severe manifestations of disease than counterparts in rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lenses. Silicone hydro-gel lenses also appear to have similar effects with prolonged use. Incidence among extended wearers is supposed to be higher than the daily wearers of soft lenses.
With an increased frequency of contact lens replacement from more than four weeks to a period less than that, the incidence of GPC reduces. Both sexes develop GPC. GPC may be more aggressive in children who wear contact lenses.
The condition has also been reported in patients with:-
- Ocular dermoids.
- Ocular prosthesis.
- Exposed sutures/ knots following ocular procedures (such as monofilament nylon sutures).
- Extruded scleral buckles.
- Glaucoma filtering blebs.
- Corneal surface irregularity. 
- Exposed corneal deposits.
- Tissue adhesives.
- Even elevated corneal scars.
    Dry eye is a common association, especially with contact lens wearer.
A related phenomenon is the so called ‘mucus fishing syndrome’, when, in a variety of underlying anterior segment disorders, patients develop or exacerbate a chronic papillary reaction due to repetitive manual removal of mucus. Giant papillae can also be seen in other conditions such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC).
One study suggests that patients who suffer from allergies seem to have more severe signs and symptoms of GPC. Significant correlation between GPC and other forms of allergy like rhinitis, hay fever and environmental allergy were found. Giant papillary conjunctivitis can follow seasonality similar to that of environmental allergies.
Because of the high prevalence of GPC in contact lens wearers, every patient who wears contact lens should be considered potential candidate for GPC.","Many contact lens wearers consider their symptoms as normal discomfort associated with contact lens use. Symptoms may be worse after lens removal. Often, in early disease, these symptoms may be out of proportion to the clinical findings.
GPC patients may have variety of symptoms in eye, such as:
- Redness.
- Burning sensation.
- Itching.
- Irritation.
- Foreign body sensation.
- Increased mucus secretion, particularly on awakening in the morning (especially at the inner canthus).
- Decreased contact lens tolerance.
- Excessive contact lens movement.
- Blurring of vision.
- Ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid).
- Bloody tears (very rare).","The antigens responsible for giant papillary conjunctivitis are not yet identified.
The initiating event is believed to be antigenic stimulus and/or mechanical irritation of the upper palpebral (lid) conjunctiva, perhaps by a contact lens surface or edge or deposit, followed by histological changes in the tissue (mast cell de-granulation and secondary inflammatory cascade). This leads to conjunctivitis and further tissue changes and increasing inflammatory markers in the tears.
Debris on the surface of contact lenses may be a cause as well as a result, leading to inflammation that causes more lens deposits to form, leading to further inflammation.
Poor cleaning, thick or rough contact lens edges, heat sterilisation and extended wearing time favour the development of giant papillary conjunctivitis.
First-generation silicone hydro-gel contact lenses may be more prone to GPC development, perhaps because of their mechanical stiffness or higher propensity for lipid deposition. Silicone hydro-gel lenses tend to induce more local GPC, whereas soft (hydro-gel) lenses tend to induce more generalised GPC reactions in upper palpebral conjunctiva.
Antigenic factors:
In patients with GPC, there is increase in numbers of inflammatory cells like neutrophils, lymphocytes, mast cells, plasma cells eosinophils and basophils in conjunctival epithelium and substantia propria. These findings, along with elevation of cytokines and chemokines in the tear film of GPC patients, suggest a possible allergic mechanism for the development of disease. Locally produced tear immunoglobulin (e.g. IgE, IgG, and even IgM in severe cases) are also found to be elevated in the tears of GPC patients, with the degree of elevation correlated to the severity of symptoms. With discontinuation of lens wear and resolution of the signs and symptoms, these tear immunoglobulin levels return to normal.
The proteinaceous deposits on the lens surface have been cited as the possible nidus for the development of inflammation and thus, the papillae associated with GPC. Even with the best cleaning regimens involving enzymatic treatment, a residual coating still exists, and as new coating material is constantly built on the surface of the lens, the overall lens coating increases. The lens type and material also affect the rate and amount of accumulation of protein coating.
The nature of these deposits is similar in patients with and without GPC. However, those affected with GPC generally have more coating on their contact lenses. Immunoglobulin G, A and M (IgG, IgA and IgM) are also found in the protein deposit on GPC-associated contact lenses.
Mechanical hypothesis: 
Mechanical hypothesis, is supported by the association between GPC and inert objects, such as cyanoacrylate adhesives, exposed sutures and scleral buckle elements, ocular dermoids and orbital prosthesis. It is postulated that the irritation produced by lens damages conjunctival epithelial cells, and causes release of chemotactic factors (e.g. neutrophil chemotactic factor). It is suggested that a combination of direct trauma and the resulting inflammation cascade can stimulate a hypersensitivity reaction to lens-bound antigens.","Diagnosis of GPC is generally made by thorough history and careful clinical observation.
GPC shares morphologic and histologic similarities with VKC, but is best differentiated from this and other immunologically based conjunctival inflammation by the associated clinical history (e.g. contact lens wear, surgical intervention).
A careful and selective history is necessary to elicit the reports of symptoms that many may consider normal discomfort associated with contact lens use.
A history of systemic allergy also help to predict which of the contact lens users may end up with GPC.
Slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist is required for the diagnosis.
The bio-microscopic finding of normal tarsal conjunctiva, include a vascular arcade of fine, radiating vessels running perpendicular to the lid margin and a smooth, moist and pink surface. This has been termed a ‘satin’ appearance. Generally, the surface is devoid of papillae, or there may be a fine, fairly uniform papillary appearance detectable after the instillation of fluorescein dye and examination with cobalt-blue filter. These papillae, if present, are often smaller than 0.3 mm in size. Non-specific signs of inflammation, such as thickening of the tarsal conjunctiva with mild hyperaemia, may be noted in early cases. In addition, bulbar conjunctival injection, superior corneal pannus, and corneal opacities may also be found on examination. As the disease progresses, non-uniform papillary changes develop, and finally giant papillae are seen, defined as a papillary reaction greater than 0.3 mm.
Allansmith divided superior tarsal surface into three zones. Zone 1 is located proximally along the uppermost edge of tarsal plate, zone 3 is located distally adjacent to the lid margin, with zone 2 in between. Papillae associated with soft contact lens-related GPC first appear in zone 1 and progress to zone 2 and 3.This pattern is reversed in GPC related to rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens wear. Papillae associated with RGP contact lenses are typically seen in zone 3, adjacent to the lid margin or distal half of the lid. These papillae are usually fewer in number and flattened in appearance. The topographic difference between GPC associated with large diameter soft contact lenses and small diameter RGP lenses is most probably related to mechanical or immunological stimulus for GPC. The conjunctiva is affected in sequential manner as the disease progresses. In the early stages, there is hyperaemia of the conjunctiva, with partial loss of the vascular pattern of conjunctiva. The papillae size is around 0.3mm. With progression of the disease there is more congestion of the tarsal surface with loss of vascular pattern. In severe cases, the tarsal plate is thickened with total obscuration of the vascular pattern. This stage may be associated with sub-conjunctival scarring.
Characterisation of the size and location of the papillae is helpful in correlating clinical findings with patient symptoms. Delineation of the upper tarsal plate into three zones, as well as two areas medially and laterally, can be useful to the clinician in determining whether findings are within the normal variance or whether it represents disease. For example, large papillae in the junctional or transitional zone are not considered pathologic and should be disregarded in the assessment of the upper tarsal conjunctiva.
Bio-microscopic findings may also be helpful, as the location and appearance of the papillae are associated with the type and material of the lens. Soft contact lens wearers often exhibit a generalised papillary response, whereas those wearing rigid gas-permeable lenses or silicone hydro-gels manifest papillae in a more localised fashion. Soft lens wearers usually form papillae nearest the upper margin of the tarsal plate and progress to diffuse involvement, whereas rigid lens wearers and those using silicone hydro-gel lenses develop papillae near the lid margin and persist in a more localised pattern.
In addition, other associated signs and symptoms can aid in the diagnosis of GPC. These signs and symptoms are often classified into four stages:
Stage 1, or Preclinical disease: Minimal mucous discharge is usually noted upon awakening, and patients may have occasional itching after lens removal. Examination of the lens reveals a mild protein coating. The tarsal conjunctiva may appear normal, or exhibit mild hyperaemia with normal vascular structures.
Stage 2, or Mild disease: There is increased mucous production along with itching, increased lens awareness and marked coating of the contact lens. Blurring of vision may occur. Mild to moderate injection of the tarsal conjunctiva is seen with some loss of normal vascular pattern (i.e. superficial vessels are typically obscured, but deeper vessels are still visible). The papillary reaction noted on examination may show variability in terms of the size of the papillae. Some of the papillae measure 0.3 mm or greater at this stage, and can best be detected upon examination with cobalt-blue filter after instillation of fluorescein dye.
Stage 3, or Moderate disease: Itching and mucous formation, along with lens coating, are more prominent, and patients often have difficulty with lens tolerance and keeping the lens clean. Increased lens awareness and excessive lens movement with blinking results in fluctuating vision and reduction in lens wear time. The tarsal conjunctiva shows marked thickening and injection, with obscuration of normal vascular pattern. The papillae increases in both size and number, and the papillae appear more elevated secondary to changes in the underlying tissue (e.g. sub-conjunctival fibrosis and thickening).
Stage 4, or severe disease: Patients are often unable to wear their lenses at all, with intense discomfort and cloudy vision upon initial insertion of the lens. There is excessive lens movement and poor centration of the contact lens. Increased mucous secretion is also seen, often to the point where the eyelids are stuck together in the morning. The normal vascular pattern is completely obscured, and the papillae have enlarged to size of 1 mm or greater. There may be sub-conjunctival scarring and fluorescein staining of the apices of papillae.
It is important to note that, although these stages can aid in the characterisation of the disease, patient presentation is often variable. Some patients may have minimal complaints but exhibit marked inflammatory changes on the tarsal conjunctiva; in contrast, patients with severe symptoms may present with only mild or early tarsal changes. Also, despite GPC is often noted bilaterally, the clinical findings may be grossly asymmetric. In some cases, the disparity between eyes is easily explained (e.g. poor lens fit), but in other cases, no specific reason is determined.
Thus signs of GPC are:
- Increased mucous discharge. Increased mucous discharge in GPC is because of increased surface area and thickness of epithelium with a resultant increase in total number of goblet cells. There is also increased mucous secretion by non-goblet epithelial cells.
- Substantial CL protein deposits may be present.
- Excessive CL mobility due to upper lid capture.
- Superior tarsal hyperaemia and papillae; by definition, ‘giant’ papillae are &gt; 1.0 mm in diameter, but the clinical syndrome of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis commonly features only fine/medium papillae, particularly in early or mild disease.
- Focal apical ulceration and whitish scarring may develop on larger papillae.
- Ptosis may occur, mainly as a result of irritative spasm and tissue laxity secondary to chronic inflammation.
The pathognomonic sign of disease is papillae formation on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Presence of papillae larger than 0.3 mm in association with presence of the symptoms is diagnostic of GPC.
Histological/ Immuno-histochemical studies:
Neutrophils and lymphocytes are present in the epithelium and substantia propria of normal conjunctival tissue. Mast cells and plasma cells are also present, though they are sequestered to the substantia propria. In patients with GPC, these cells increase in number and are often found throughout the epithelium and the substantia propria, and are found in conjunction with other inflammatory cells, such as basophils and eosinophils. Elevation of cytokines and chemokines in the tear film of GPC patients, suggest a possible allergic mechanism for the development of disease. Locally produced tear immunoglobulin (e.g. IgE, IgG, and even IgM in severe cases) are also elevated in the tears of GPC patients.
The proteinaceous deposits on the lens surface have been cited as the possible nidus for the development of inflammation and thus, the papillae associated with GPC. The lens type and material also affect the rate and amount of accumulation of protein coating.
The nature of these deposits is similar in patients with and without GPC. Those affected with GPC generally have more coating on their contact lenses. Immunoglobulin G, A and M (IgG, IgA and IgM) are also found in the protein deposits on GPC-associated contact lenses.
GPC should be differentiated from conditions such as:
- Allergic conjunctivitis.
- Viral conjunctivitis.
- Bacterial conjunctivitis.
- Chlamydial genitourinary infections.
- Congenital ptosis.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Other cause of conjunctival papillae should be excluded, as well as CL intolerance due to other causes, such as a reaction to lens cleaning solutions and dry eyes.
GPC treatment is directed at reducing or eliminating any mechanical stimulation and lens coating from the contact lenses or modulating the immune response to the antigenic proteins on the lens surface. Depending on the severity of disease, several or all of the strategies for reducing lens coating or mechanical stimulation may need to be employed.
The ultimate goal in managing patients with GPC is to allow them to continue wearing their contact lenses.
Individuals utilising daily disposable lenses have not been reported to develop GPC.
Removal of the stimulus:
- Measures adopted to reduce exposure to the antigenic proteins on the contact lens:

CL wear should be discontinued for several weeks and the current lenses replaced. For mild-moderate disease, this may be adequate for resolution. In severe CLPC a longer interval without lens wear may be needed.
Decreasing the lens wear time.
Changing design of the contact lens.
Changing the lens material.
Shortening contact lens replacement interval.

- Assessment of the status and fit of an ocular prosthesis.
- Replacement of ocular prosthesis by a new prosthesis (preferably coated with bio-compatible material- biocoat).
- Removal of other underlying causes, such as exposed sutures or a scleral buckle.
- Partial excision, revision with non-penetrating drainage surgery or glaucoma drainage device implantation for filtering bleb.
- Cessation of contact lens wear, substituting spectacles or refractive surgery, may be necessary for severe or refractory disease.

Ensure effective cleaning of CL or ocular prosthesis:
- Changing the type of CL solution, particularly discontinuation of preservative-containing preparations. Cleaning, rinsing and storage solutions containing preservatives such as thiomersal and chlorhexidine should be discarded.
- Switching to monthly, then daily disposable CL, if the condition persists after renewing non-disposable lenses.
- Rigid lenses carry a lesser risk of CLPC, probably because they are easier to clean effectively.
- Regular (at least weekly) use of contact lens protein removal tablets (enzyme cleaning).
- Ocular prosthesis: Ocular prosthesis should be cleaned with detergent and polished.

General measures:
-Cold compresses: Cold compresses help in improving symptoms.

Medical therapy:
Medications such as mast cell stabilisers and topical corticosteroids may be needed to control immune reaction.
Drug therapy includes:
-Topical artificial tears: Artificial tears provide lubrication and help to wash away the environmental allergens and lens debris.
-Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor) may offer relief in some cases.
-Topical mast cell stabilisers: Mast cell stabilisers should be non-preserved in patients wearing soft contact lens, or can be instilled when the lenses are not in the eye, with a delay of perhaps half an hour after drop instillation prior to lens insertion. Most can be continued long-term if necessary. Examples are cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide, nedocromil and pemirolast. Cromolyn sodium in early GPC, particularly when combined with meticulous lens hygiene, gives relief of foreign body sensation, dryness, congestion, mucus production and in papillary size.
-Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective, and thus significantly reduce the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.
-Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs): Agents such as azelastine, epinastine, bepotastine, olopatadine and ketotifen have both mast cell-stabilising and anti-histamine properties. These agents have a relatively rapid onset of action. Topical antihistamine and mast cell stabiliser combination solution may offer a pharmacologic adjunctive treatment. Combined antihistamine/mast cell stabilisers generally suffice without exposing the patient to the known risks of topical corticosteroids. Most patients do not require more aggressive treatment.
-Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations like ketorolac and diclofenac may improve symptoms. Combining one of these with a mast cell stabiliser is an effective regimen in some patients.
-Topical corticosteroids: Topical steroids like fluorometholone or loteprednol may be used. Topical steroids can be used for the acute phase of resistant cases, particularly those where effective removal of the stimulus is difficult, as in bleb-related disease.
Short-term low-potency topical corticosteroid used concurrently with combined antihistamine/mast cell stabiliser (dual-acting drugs) is a more effective treatment than mono-therapy with either separately.
There is no role of long-term usage of topical steroids in treatment due to associated complications (development of cataract, glaucoma or superadded infections).
-Immune-modulator drugs: Immune-modulator drug such as tacrolimus ointment is found to be comparable to fluorometholone in efficacy without the side effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of GPC. (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/22821643).
Topical tacrolimus ointment for severe GPC cases, refractory to conventional therapy, appears to be effective alternative treatment (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/18216583).

Immune response modulation for GPC mainly focuses on topical therapy, most commonly mast cell stabilisers and loteprednol. Mast cell stabilisers may be used in patients with moderate to severe GPC that suffered a recurrence of symptoms despite changes in the contact lens design or polymer. The use of steroids, such as loteprednol, has been found to reduce the presence of papillae, itching, and lens intolerance. However, chronic treatment with a steroid is generally not recommended in these cases.
A combination of the two options seems most appropriate for initiating treatment for the patient suffering from GPC.

For stage 1, more frequent observation (e.g. 4-6 month follow-up) may be all that is required, as these individuals are generally asymptomatic but will be predisposed to developing GPC.
Treatment for stage 2 to stage 3 should begin with discontinuation of contact lenses for about 2-4 weeks, with re-evaluation of the conjunctiva and refit with frequent replacement of contact lenses. These can range from daily disposables lenses to lenses that are replaced every 2 weeks. For those changing their lenses every 1-2 weeks, a lens cleaning regimen utilising a hydrogen peroxide (disinfection by hydrogen peroxide appears to be least likely to further traumatise the conjunctiva)based cleaner is preferred. If there is return of symptoms despite a change in the lens type and polymer, discontinue the lenses for another 2-4 weeks, refit with a daily disposable lens (or RGP lens) and add a mast cell stabiliser. These patients should generally be re-evaluated 3-4 times in a year.
For severe, or stage 4 disease, discontinuation of contact lens wear may be required for at least 4 weeks, along with refitting the contact lens with either a daily disposable or RGP lens. Check for the resolution of associated findings of corneal and apical papillary staining. The appearance and size of the papillae may not change during the course of treatment for severe GPC. If the associated inflammatory signs have resolved, then attempts to refit the patient with a new lens may have a greater success rate. If the patient is refitted with a daily wear contact lens and replaces the lens in an interval of 4 weeks or less, the rate of developing GPC reduces.
If there is no response and signs and symptoms persist, one may have to consider discontinuing contact lens use.
Surgical therapy:
-Refractive surgery: Refractive surgery such as laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) may be considered in patients who refuse conservative management. This helps in avoiding contact lenses.
Therapeutic effect is evidenced by:
- Return of contact lens tolerance.
- Decreased mucous in tears.
- Suppression of ocular itching.
- Decreased hyperaemia of tarsal conjunctiva.
- Decreased inflammation of giant papillae.

Amelioration of symptoms is more important than clinical signs in assessment of therapeutic effect.

Prognosis:
Overall prognosis of giant papillary conjunctivitis is good. About 80% of patients may return to comfortable contact lens wear with appropriate management.
Giant papillary conjunctivitis has been a common cause of temporary and permanent contact lens intolerance.
The eyelids in some patients may return to their normal appearance following resolution of GPC, whereas in others, lid retain small, white-capped scars of giant papillae for long periods, sometimes indefinitely.
Patients should be educated about the chronic nature of disease and its clinical symptoms (e.g. Itching of eyes, mucous discharge and contact lens intolerance). Patient should be advised to present within a week of any relapsing symptoms. Patient should understand appropriate contact lens cleaning and follow-up care."
Gaming disorder,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/gaming-disorder,"Gaming disorder is recently recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) for inclusion in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). ICD is used by medical practitioners around the world to diagnose conditions and by researchers to categorize conditions.
Use of the internet, computers, smartphones and other electronic devices has excessively increased over recent decades. While the increased use in certain fields such as real-time information exchange is associated with benefits to users, excessive use in some other fields such as gaming may result in health problems. For some countries, the gaming disorder has become a significant public health concern.
WHO defines gaming disorder as a pattern of gaming behavior (“digital-gaming” or “video-gaming”) characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.
For the diagnosis of gaming disorder the behaviour pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months. However, if symptoms are severe and all requirements are met, health care professionals may include people who have been playing for shorter periods of time.
The inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 means health care workers and doctors can now diagnose people with health conditions identical to those characteristic of gaming disorder in many parts of the world and accordingly countries would take into consideration this disorder when planning public health strategies for treatment and prevention.
With increasing use of cyber space by children and students in the form of playing online games, making friends, and using social networking sites, shopping etc., they are more vulnerable to cyber-crimes.

A Handbook for Adolescents/Students on Cyber Safety_English
A Handbook for Adolescents/Students on Cyber Safety_Hindi","As with any other addictions, there are emotional and physical symptoms suggestive of gaming disorder.
Emotional symptoms of video game addiction include:

Feelings of restlessness and/or irritability when unable to play
Preoccupation with thoughts of previous online activity or anticipation of the next online session
Lying to friends or family members regarding the amount of time spent playing
Isolation from others in order to spend more time on gaming

Physical Symptoms includes

Poor personal hygiene
Video gamers’ thumb (repetitive use injury resulting in to tendonitis)
Weight gain ( due to sedentary life style and eating processed foods and beverages)
Fatigue","Various factors may be responsible for gaming disorder.
There are two types of video games. One is standard video game which is designed to play by a single player. The game is completed with a mission or clear goal hence addiction in these games is related to completing that mission or beating a high score or preset standard.
Other type of videogame is associated with online multiplayer games. Gamers with this type of addiction enjoy creating and temporarily becoming an online character. They often build relationships with other online players as an escape from reality. An intelligent child who is unpopular at school can become dominant in the game. The virtual life becomes more appealing than real life.
Video game addiction may be a clinical impulse disorder. Those with certain personality disorders or disabilities are at greater risks than others. Compulsive gamers enjoy to a fantasy world to escape their real life troubles and unpleasant emotions. A report indicates that 41% of those play online videogames wants to escape from reality.
Many video games satisfy basic psychological needs, and players often continue to play because of rewards, freedom, and a connection to other players. It takes away from physical activity and time to be spent on studies, with friends, and even with family. Children who play four to five hours per day have no time for socializing, doing homework, or playing sports and it interferes with normal social development.
Selective risk factors for gaming disorders could be-
Biological factors

Co-morbid disorders (psychiatric problem like depression, anxiety)
Vulnerability to addictions

Personality and psychological factors

Deficit of social skills and extreme shyness
Low self-esteem and indecision
Low resilience
Frustration

Environmental factors

Family environment: conflicts, poor communication and affection, lack of supervision
School environment with low performance
Poor social environment

Stress factors

Grief
Drastic life change","Assessment for gaming disorder can be done by observing the different symptoms associated with video game addiction. These are significant changes in behaviour of an individual resulting into severe impairment of personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning for at least 12 months.
However, if symptoms are severe and all requirements are met, people who have been playing for shorter periods of time may be considered for gaming disorder by health care professionals.
The warning signs of video game addiction include:

Gaming to escape from real life problems like anxiety/depression or difficult life situations
Playing for longer periods as time goes on
Skipping showers and meals to play
Poor performance at work or school
Lying to friends/ family to hide gaming activities
Exhibiting signs of irritation when forced to stop gaming

In addition, video game addicts tend to become isolated, dropping out of their social networks and giving up other hobbies.","Integrated and comprehensive approach with consideration of co-morbid disorders and other risk factors would improve treatment outcome of such individuals.
Psychotherapy-One to one counseling and family counseling are effective in treating a gaming disorder. Psychotherapist tries to help the addict understand how gaming is related to their family, school or job, emotions or mood and sense of life goals and rewards.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-This helps the addict to shift their thoughts, replacing those that lead to compulsive gaming with healthier thinking patterns. It allows the person to modify their thoughts, feelings and ultimately behaviour for the better.
Medication-Certain medications help video game addicts by altering their brain chemistry to reduce the urge to play. Many videogame addicts suffer from mental health problems such as depression or anxiety disorder, treating these problems will also help to overcome addictions as well.
Sometimes by placing the addicts in a natural environment, free of distractions of modern life allows them to learn to comfortable with their own emotions."
Gum disease,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/gum-disease,"Gum disease also known as periodontal disease is a chronic bacterial infection affecting gums and bone supporting the teeth. It may be in the form of simple gum inflammation to serious disease that can cause major harm to gums and supporting bone. Gum disease is highly prevalent and affect up to 90% of the population worldwide, and it is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. It is caused by accumulation of plaque (bacterial biofilm) which convert into calculus (tartar) along the gum line, when oral hygiene is not maintained. Gum diseases may sometimes be neglected as these are usually painless.

Hepatitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/liver/hepatitis,"Hepatitis is a term used to describe inflammation (swelling) of the liver. It can be caused due to viral infection or when liver is exposed to harmful substances such as alcohol. Hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms, but often leads tojaundice, anorexia (poor appetite) and malaise. Hepatitis is of 2 types: acute and chronic.
Acute hepatitis occurs when it lasts for less than six months andchronic if it persists for longer duration.
A group of viruses known as the hepatitis viruses most commonly cause the disease, but hepatitis can also be caused by toxic substances (notably alcohol, certain medications, some industrial organic solvents and plants), other infections and autoimmune diseases.
Types of hepatitis: The most common types of hepatitis are described below:
Hepatitis A:Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. It is the most common type of viral hepatitis. It is generally seen in the areas where sanitation and sewage disposal are poor. This disease is commonly spread through fecal-oral route (ingestion of contaminated food and water). It is usually a short-term (acute) infection and its symptoms pass away within three months. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A other than using medication, such as the painkiller ibuprofen, to relieve symptoms. A vaccination can protect against hepatitis A. Vaccination is recommended if a person is travelling to countries where the virus is common, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Central and South America, the Far East and Eastern Europe.
Hepatitis B:Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. This can be found in blood and body fluids, such as semen and vaginal fluids, so it generally spread during unprotected sex or by sharing needles to inject drugs. Hepatitis B is commonly seen in drug users. It is common in India and other parts of the world, such as China, Central and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Most people infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months. The infection can be unpleasant to live with, but usually causes no lasting harm. However, a small minority of people may develop long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B. A vaccination is available for hepatitis B, which is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as injecting drug users.
Hepatitis C:Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus. This can be found in the blood and to a much lesser extentin the saliva, semen or vaginal fluid of an infected person. It is particularly concentrated in the blood, so it is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or causes symptoms that are mistaken for the flu, therefore so many people are unaware if they are infected. Many people fight off the infection and will be free of the virus. In the remaining the virus might stay in their body for many years. This is known as chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C can be treated by taking antiviral medications, although there can be some unpleasant side effects. There is currently no vaccination for hepatitis C.
Alcoholic hepatitis:Drinking excessive amount of alcohol over the course of many years can damage the liver, leading to hepatitis. This type of hepatitis is known as alcoholic hepatitis. It is estimated that heavy drinkers has some degree of alcoholic hepatitis. The condition does not usually cause any symptoms and is often detected with a blood test. If a person with alcoholic hepatitis continues to drink alcohol, there is a real risk that he may develop cirrhosis and possibly liver failure.
Other types of hepatitis
Hepatitis D:Hepatitis D, caused by the hepatitis D virus, is only present in people already infected with hepatitis B (it needs the presence of the hepatitis B virus to be able to survive in the body).
Hepatitis E:Hepatitis E, caused by the hepatitis E virus, is generally a mild and short-term infection. It also spreads through fecal-oral route. Person-to-person transmission is rare.
Autoimmune hepatitis:Autoimmune hepatitis is a very rare cause of chronic (long-term) hepatitis. The white blood cells attack the liver, causing chronic inflammation and damage. This can lead to more serious problems, such as liver failure. The reason for this reaction is unknown. Symptoms include tiredness, pains in abdomen, joint aches, jaundice (yellow tinge to your skin and whites of eyes) and cirrhosis. Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves medicines that suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. Steroid medication (prednisolone) can gradually reduce swelling over several weeks, and can then be used to control symptoms.","Initial symptoms of hepatitis caused by infection are similar to the flu and include:

Muscle and joint pain
A high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
Feeling unwell
Headache
Occasionally yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), Symptoms of chronic hepatitis can include:

Feeling tired all the time
Depression
Jaundice
A general sense of feeling unwell","Hepatitis infection is caused by Hepatitis viruses: Type A, B, C, D, E

Hepatitis is also caused by bacterias like anaplasma, nocardia and many more
Other factors like alcohol
Auto immune conditions: systemic lupus erythematosus
Drugs: Paracetamol, amoxycillin, antituberculosis medicines, minocycline and many others
Ischemic hepatitis (circulatory insufficiency)
Metabolic diseases: Wilson's disease
Pregnancy","Diagnosis of hepatitis is made by biochemical assessment of liver function.

Initial laboratory evaluation should includebilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time, total protein, albumin, globulin, complete blood count and coagulation studies .
Hepatitis A, B,C,D, E diagnosis depends on demonstration of specific antigen and/or antibody (detected by an ELISA) in sera.
Liver biopsy tests are also conducted to know the extent of liver damage","Bed rest, refraining from alcohol, and taking medication to relieve symptoms.
Most people who have hepatitis A and E get well on their own after a few weeks.
Hepatitis B is treated with drugs, such as lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil.
Hepatitis C is treated with a combination of peginterferon and ribovarin.
Liver transplant of hepatitis B or C, or D-caused liver failure

Herpes Simplex,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/herpes-simplex-virus,"Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), are two members of the herpes virus family.
Herpes virus, generally infect humans . It clears up without treatment within 7-10 days. The herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) is usually responsible for cold sores.
In rare cases, cold sores can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can be a result of having oral sex with someone who has genital herpes. The herpes simplex virus, is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. After someone has contracted the virus, it remains dormant (inactive) for most of the time. Although the virus can be activated by certain triggers, resulting in an outbreak of cold sores. These triggers vary from person to person but can include fatigue, an injury to the affected area.","In children:

Mouth sores
Fever
Swollen and tender lymph glands are the most common symptoms.

These sores slowly heal over 7 to 14 days. However in adults, the symptoms are so mild that no one is even aware that an infection is present.
If genitals are affected:The herpes lesions are found on the penis, vagina, cervix, vulva, buttocks, or other nearby parts of the body.
As with the oral sores, someone with genital herpes may have repeated outbreaks over a lifetime. Herpes simplex viruses also cause encephalitis, an infection of the brain. Children with encephalitis have fever, headache, irritability, and confusion. Seizures are common. Herpes simplex type 2 often causes a mild form ofmeningitisthat does not cause long-term problems or brain damage.
Recurrent infections:After initial herpes infection occurs and has run its course, the virus itself will remain in the nerve cells of his body in an inactive or dormant (latent) form. The infected person becomes the carrier of the herpes virus for life. At time virus may become active again resulting in cold, heat, fever, fatigue, stress, or exposure to sunlight, causing a return of a cold sore (secondary HSV infection). These outbreaks often begin with a tingling or itching sensation in the area where the sores are about to break out. The sores and blisters often become crusty before healing.","Herpes simplex is generally caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (HSV-1,2).
Aggravating factors: Factors thought to trigger outbreaks of cold sores include:

Emotional upset or psychological stress
Tiredness and fatigue
An injury to the affected area
Menstruation
Strong sunlight","The primary method of testing for the virus is:
The herpes culture
HSV DNA testing (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Though it is not as sensitive.
HSV antibody testing can be used to help diagnose an acute HSV infection. It is done by collecting the blood samples of the patient. The convalescent blood sample is collected several weeks after the acute sample, and HSV IgG antibody levels are compared to see if they have risen significantly, indicating a current infection.
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose you should consult your physician.","There is no way to eradicate herpes virus from the body, but antiviral medications can reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of outbreaks.

Pain killers like ibuprofen can reduce pain and fever.
Anti viral drugs like acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, and penciclovir. If used correctly, they may speed up the healing time of a recurrent infection.
Topical application of antiviral creams can also help in healing outbreak of infection. They do not get rid of the herpes simplex virus or prevent future outbreaks of cold sores occurring.

Haemophilia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/haemophilia,"Haemophiliais an inherited condition that affects the blood’s ability to clot.
Haemophilia A (clotting factor VIII deficiency) is the most common form of the disorder, present in about 1 in 5,000–10,000 births.
Haemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) occurs in around 1 in about 20,000–34,000 births. Haemophilia is more likely to occur in males than females. This is due to the fact that females have two X chromosomes while males have only one, so the defective gene is guaranteed to manifest in any male who carries it. As females have two X chromosomes, the chance of a female having two defective copies of the gene is very rare, so females are almost asymptomatic carriers of the disorder.
The factors whichclot(solidify) the blood is low in patients of Haemophilia.Thus when a blood vessel is injured, a temporary scab does form, but the missing coagulation factors prevent fibrin formation, which is necessary to maintain the blood clot. Hemophiliac does not bleed more intensely than a person without it, but can bleed for a much longer time. In severe hemophiliacs even a minor injury can cause lot of blood loss which can last for days or weeks, or even never healing completely. In areas such as the brain or inside joints, this can be fatal or permanently debilitating.","The severity of the condition is determined by the level of clotting factors in the blood:

Mild haemophilia – someone has 5 to 50% of the normal amount of clotting factors
Moderate haemophilia – someone has 1 to 5% of the normal amount of clotting factors
Severe haemophilia – someone has less than 1% of the normal amount of clotting factors.

Mild haemophilia: Patient suffering may not have the symptoms but sometimes the condition becomes apparent after a significant wound or surgery. These events could cause unusually prolonged bleeding.
Moderate haemophilia: Patient with moderate haemophilia bruise easily. They may also have symptoms of internal bleeding around their joints, especially if they have a knock or a fall that affects their joints. This is known as a joint bleed. The symptoms usually begin with a feeling of irritation and mild pain in the affected joint. Most common involved areas are ankle joints, knee joints and elbow joints. Less commonly, the shoulder and hip joints can also be affected. If a joint bleed remains untreated, it can lead to:

More severe joint pain
Stiffness
The site of the bleed becoming hot, swollen and tender  

Severe haemophilia: People with severe hemophilia can develop:

Joint deformity, which may require replacement surgery
Soft tissue bleeding, which could lead to further complications
Serious internal bleeding","Genetics: The genes are responsible for clotting factors VIII and IX are on the (X) chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY). If a female inherits an X chromosome with ‘haemophilia’ clotting factor genes, the other X chromosome will usually be normal, so they are still able to produce safe levels of clotting factors. Although some female ‘carriers’ of the ‘haemophilia’ X chromosome do have occasional clotting problems, they are rarely as serious as the problems in males. If a male inherits a ‘haemophilia’ X chromosome and they will not be able to produce normal levels of the clotting factors they need. Most males who inherit the ‘haemophilia’ X chromosome will have clotting problems some will be extremely severe.","Several options are available to diagnose hemophilia before, during and after birth if there is a family history of the condition.
Tests before pregnancy: Genetic testing and counseling.
Tests during pregnancy: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) It is a procedure in which a small sample of placenta is removed from the womb and tested for the haemophilia gene, usually during weeks 10 to 13 of pregnancy.
Amniocentesis: In this amniotic fluid is taken for testing, usually during weeks 15 to 20 or pregnancy.
Tests after birth: If a child is suspected with hemophilia, a blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis. The blood test will also be able to identify whether child has hemophilia A or B.
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose you should consult your physician.","As such there is no cure for haemophilia, it can be managed with regular infusions of the deficient clotting factor, i.e. factor VIII in hemophilia A or factor IX in haemophilia B. Factor replacement can either be isolated from human blood serum or a combination of the two. Some haemophiliacs develop antibodies (inhibitors) against the replacement factors given to them, so the amount of the factor has to be increased or non-human replacement products must be given, such as porcine factor VIII.
Gene therapy: On 10 December 2011, a team of British and American investigators reported the successful treatment of haemophilia B using gene therapy. They inserted the F9 gene into an adeno-associated virus-8 vector, which has a propensity for the liver, where factor 9 is produced, and remains outside the chromosomes so as not to disrupt other genes. The transduced virus was infused intravenously. To prevent rejection, the patients were primed with steroids to suppress their immune response.
Immune tolerance therapy (ITT): People with moderate to severe inhibitors are usually advised to try a treatment called immune tolerance therapy (ITT). ITT involves receiving daily injections of either octocog alfa (for hemophilia A) or nonacog alfa (for hemophilia B). ITT is carried out on a long-term basis, with most people needing a course of treatment that lasts 6–24 months.

Hemangioma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/hemangioma,"A haemangioma is a benign tumour of the endothelial cells that line blood vessels and is characterized by increased number of normal or abnormal vessels filled with blood.
It is generally seen during the first week of life and resolves by the age of 10. It is the most common tumour in infancy. Haemangiomas are connected to the circulatory system. The appearance depends upon its location. If they are on the surface of the skin, they are evocative of a ripe strawberry (hence, they are sometime called as ""strawberry haemangiomas""). If they are just under the skin they present as a bluish swelling.","A red to reddish-purple, raised sore (lesion) on the skin
A massive, raised tumour with blood vessels.

Mostly haemangiomas are found on the face and neck.","The exact cause of haemangioma is currently unknown. It consists of an abnormally dense group of extra blood vessels. The haemangioma may be:

In the top skin layers (capillary haemangioma)
Deeper in the skin (cavernous haemangioma)

A combination of both Haemangioma together may occur.",A haemangioma is usually diagnosed based on its appearance. Diagnostic tests aren't usually needed.,"Laser surgery: Laser surgery is generally performed to stop the growth of a haemangioma. Sometimes lasers can be used to remove a haemangioma or treat sores on a haemangioma that won't heal. The risks include pain, infection, bleeding, scarring and changes in skin colour.
Corticosteroid medications:Corticosteroids can be injected, given orally or applied to the skin. These medications are most effective when they're given during the growth phase. They're used to stop the growth of the haemangioma. Long-term or repeated treatment may be needed.
For treatment one should consult the doctor."
Horner Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/horner-syndrome,"Horner syndrome (oculosympathetic palsy) is characterised by the classical triad of miosis (small and constricted pupil), partial ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid) and anhidrosis (loss of hemi facial sweating) caused due to disruption of sympathetic pathways. Von Passow syndrome is an association of Horner syndrome with heterochromia iridis (different colour in parts of same iris).
Sympathetic supply to the eye forms an arc of three neurons. First order neuron extend from posterolateral hypothalamus to ciliospinal center of Budge at cervical 8 to thoracic level 2 (C8-T2) in spinal cord.
Second order preganglionic pupillomotor fibers exit from thoracic level 1 (T1) and synapse in superior cervical ganglion at the cervical level 3 and 4 (C3-C4). Postganglionic vasomotor and sudomotor fibers innervate blood vessels and sweat glands of the face.
Third order postganglionic pupillomotor fibers joins ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve (Vth intracranial nerve) which innervates dilator muscle of iris and Mϋller muscle in the upper lid, via long ciliary nerves.","Disruption of sympathetic pathway due to a lesion may lead to:
- Miosis or constriction of the pupil in affected eye. Dilatation of the pupil is slower after psycho sensory stimulus.
- Mild ptosis due to denervation of sympathetic nerve supply to Mϋller muscle.
- Slight elevation of the lower lid due to denervation of lower lid muscle.
- Impaired flushing and sweating ipsilaterally depending upon the site of lesion. First order neuron lesion causes anhidrosis on ipsilateral side of the body. Second order neuron lesion causes anhidrosis on ipsilateral side of face.
- Heterochromia iridis occurs in congenital Horner syndrome or in children younger than two years. Long standing Horner syndrome may also develop heterochromia.","Horner syndrome may be hereditary (autosomal dominant), congenital or acquired. Lesions may be central (involves hypothalamus or spinal cord) or peripheral (involves cervical sympathetic chain).
Different lesions may disrupt sympathetic pathways at various levels:
First order neuron lesions may occur in following conditions:
- Basal skull tumours
- Cerebrovascular accidents
- Basal meningitis
- Lesions in hypothalamus or medulla
- Arnold-Chiari malformation
- Pontine haemorrhage
- Neck trauma with high cervical cord lesion
- Pituitary tumour
- Syringomyelia
- Demyelinating diseases

Second order neuron lesions may be due to conditions like:
- Pancoast tumour(carcinoma of the apex of lung)
- Birth trauma affecting lower brachial plexus
- Aneurysm or dissection of aorta
- Central venous catheterisation
- Trauma or surgical injury
- Chest tubes
- Cervical rib
- Neuroblastoma

Third order neuron lesions may be due to:
- Dissection of internal carotid artery
- Cluster headache
- Carotid cavernous fistula
- Herpes Zoster infection","Presenting features depends upon the underlying cause.
First order neuron lesion causes dysarthria, dysphagia, ataxia or hemisensory loss.
Second order neuron lesions may have history of prior trauma or surgery, placement of central venous line or history of chest tube application.
Third order neuron lesions may cause diplopia due to sixth cranial nerve palsy, numbness or pain in the distribution area of ophthalmic and maxillary division of trigeminal nerve ( Vth cranial nerve).
Examination:
- Miosis of the pupil which dilates slowly to psycho sensory stimulus.
- Absence of horizontal eyelid crease in eye with ptosis, especially in patients with congenital Horner syndrome.
- Raised lower eyelid margin with respect to inferior limbus.
-    Examination of extraocular movements may show limitation of abduction due to sixth cranial nerve palsy.
- Biomicroscopic examination may show heterochromia iridis.
- Anhidrosis (lack of sweating) and its pattern may help in localising lesion.
- Normal pupillary reactions to light and near vision.
- Apparent enophthalmos due to ptosis of upper eyelid and slight elevation of lower eyelid.
- Paradoxical retraction of contra lateral upper eyelid.
- Exclude malignancy in recently diagnosed preganglionic Horner syndrome. Patients may have associated flushing.
- Patients with postganglionic Horner syndrome may have orbital pain.

Pharmacological testing:
Pharmacological testing helps in identifying an ocular sympathetic lesion. Preganglionic lesions are associated with higher incidence of malignancy.
1. Cocaine test: Topical cocaine inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine from synaptic cleft and therefore acts as indirect sympathomimetic agent. Pupil dilates poorly in Horner syndrome unlike in normal eyes. Cocaine is instilled into each eye. After 40-60 minutes, an unequal size of pupil more than 0.8 mm is significant.
2. Apraclonidine test: Topical apraclonidine has no effect on normal pupil but has mydriatic (which dilates pupil) effect on abnormal pupil. There is increased sensitivity to apraclonidine in Horner syndrome. However, in acute cases, negative apraclonidine test does not exclude Horner syndrome, where cocaine test is more helpful.
3. Hydroxyamphetamine test: Topical hydroxyamphetamine releases norepinephrine from postganglionic neurons at iris dilator muscles (which dilates the pupil). Hydroxyamphetamine in cases of Horner syndrome with intact postganglionic fiber dilates affected pupil to an equal or greater extent as compared to normal pupil. However, pupil in Horner syndrome with damaged postganglionic fiber, do not dilate as well, as the normal pupil dilates.
4. Adrenaline test: Topical adrenaline (1:1000) in preganglionic lesions, does not cause dilatation of both pupils. In postganglionic lesions, due to denervation hypersensitivity, affected pupil dilates but the normal pupil does not (with this low concentration of adrenaline).

Imaging studies:
1. X-ray chest may be helpful in diagnosing apical bronchogenic carcinoma.
2. CT scan of head may be helpful in cases of stroke.
3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain and neck may delineate carotid artery dissection.","Many cases of Horner syndrome do not have effective treatment.
Management depends upon the underlying cause. For example, Carotid artery dissection or aneurysm requires vascular surgery. Similarly, pancoast tumour may require multi modality treatment."
Hypertensive Retinopathy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/hypertensive-retinopathy,"Hypertension or raised blood pressure is usually considered when the reading exceeds 140mm of Hg (systolic) and 90mm of Hg (diastolic). It is recorded as 140/90mm of Hg. Treatment at this level depends upon risk of coronary events, presence of diabetes or end organ damage. All patients with malignant hypertension or a sustained blood pressure more than 160/100mm of Hg should be treated. Malignant hypertension refers to severe hypertension ( more than 200mm of Hg as systolic and more than 130mm of Hg as diastolic) in conjunction with bilateral retinal haemorrhages and exudates with or without papilloedema.
In hypertensive retinopathy, retinal arterioles (small diameter blood vessels joining arteries to capillaries) respond to systemic hypertension by narrowing. Narrowing depends upon the degree of pre-existent involutional sclerosis (fibrosis). Therefore, hypertensive narrowing in its pure form is seen in young individuals whereas less narrowing is seen in older individuals due to rigidity of vessels (caused by involutional sclerosis). In sustained systemic hypertension, there is vascular leakage due to disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Hypertensive retinopathy shows features of narrowing (Vasoconstriction), involutional sclerosis (arteriosclerosis) and leakage (haemorrhage, oedema and hard exudates).","Most of the patients do not show any symptoms.
Patients with malignant hypertension may present with headache, pain in the eye or reduced vision.
Involutional sclerosis as such does not produce any symptoms. However, complications of sclerosis like macro-aneurysms or vascular occlusions may produce symptoms.","Chronic hypertension leads to arteriosclerotic changes in the blood vessels.
Hypertension may be primary or essential for which there is no detectable cause.
Secondary hypertension may be caused by an underlying disease such as:
- Primary hyperaldosteronism.
- Cushing’s syndrome.
- Phaeochromocytoma.
-    Renal vascular or renal parenchymal disease.
- Coarctation of aorta.
- Hyperthyroidism.
- Hyperparathyroidism.
Major risk factor for essential hypertension is the severity of hypertension. General risk factors are use of tobacco, alcohol, high salt diet, obesity and stress.
For arteriosclerotic hypertension, it is the duration of disease which is an important risk factor.","Diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy is based on presence of systemic hypertension and examination of retina (by an eye specialist) after dilating the pupil.
Retinal or Fundus examination:
It may show:
- Narrowing of blood vessels (vasoconstriction): Blood vessels may show generalised or localised narrowing. Severe hypertension may lead to obstruction of arterioles and formation of cotton-wool spots.
- Leakage: Abnormal vascular permeability leads to retinal oedema, flame-shaped haemorrhages and formation of hard exudates. Hard exudates may be arranged as macular star around the fovea. There may be swelling of the optic nerve head as disc oedema in malignant hypertension.
- Arteriosclerosis: There is thickening of blood vessel wall. Thickening causes marked changes at arteriovenous crossings.
Hypertensive retinopathy is graded as (Keith-Wagener classification):
- Grade 1: It is characterised by mild generalised arteriolar narrowing and tortuosity, particularly of smaller branches, with broadening of arteriolar light reflex and concealment of vein.
- Grade 2: There is more severe generalised as well as focal arteriolar narrowing. There is deflection of veins at arteriovenous crossings (Salus’ sign).
- Grade 3: It consists of copper-wiring of arterioles, banking of veins distal to arteriovenous crossings (Bonnet’s sign), tapering of veins on both sides of arteriovenous crossings (Gunn’s sign) and right angled deviation of veins. Cotton wool spots, hard exudates and flame-shaped haemorrhages may also be present.
- Grade 4: Along with changes of grade 3, there may be silver-wiring of arterioles (due to further sclerosis) and disc swelling.
Systemic hypertension may show other ocular manifestations such as:
- Retinal artery occlusion.
- Branch retinal vein occlusion.
- Retinal arterial macroaneurysm.
- Ischaemic choroidal infarcts (Elschnig’s spots).
- Ischaemic optic neuropathy.
Fluorescein angiography test: Acute malignant hypertension on fluorescein angiography shows non-perfusion of retinal capillaries, microaneurysms and dendritic pattern of choroidal filling in early phase. There is diffuse leakage in late phase.","Systemic hypertension should be controlled as a primary measure for Hypertensive retinopathy.
Change in lifestyle with reduction of general risk factors (salt restriction, avoidance of tobacco) help in controlling hypertension.
Drugs may be used from groups like:
- Diuretics.
- Beta blockers.
- Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
- Calcium channel blockers.
- Angiotensin receptor antagonists.
Patients with severe hypertensive retinopathy are at increased risk of coronary artery disease, stroke or peripheral vascular disease. Arteriosclerotic changes increases the risk of retinal macroaneurysms, retinal artery or vein occlusion. Visual acuity may be reduced due to involvement of optic nerve and macula.
Hypertensive retinopathy with vision threatening complication: Vision threatening complications like retinal oedema may be treated with laser therapy or intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs.
Management by drugs, lasers and intravitreal injection should be under supervision of a qualified doctor."
Helminthiasis (Soil-transmitted helminth infections),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/helminthiasis-soil-transmitted-helminth-infections,"A soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection is a sub-group within the group of helminth infections. It is caused specifically by those helminthes (worms) which are transmitted through soil contaminated with faecal matter and are therefore called soil-transmitted helminth (Intestinal parasitic worms) infections.
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are a major public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical countries and affect the poorest and most deprived communities. More than 1.5 billion people, or 24% of the world’s population, are infected with soil-transmitted helminth infections worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that in India around 241 million children between the ages of 1and14 are at a risk of parasitic intestinal worm infestation. STH infections are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces which in turn contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor.","People with light infections usually have no symptoms.
Heavier infections can cause diarrhoea and abdominal pain, general malaise and weakness, and impaired cognitive and physical development.
Hookworms cause chronic intestinal blood loss that can result in anaemia.
Effects on nutritional status-
Soil-transmitted helminths impair the nutritional status of the people they infect in multiple ways.

The worms feed on host tissues, including blood, which leads to a loss of iron and protein.
The worms increase malabsorption of nutrients. In addition, roundworm may possibly compete for vitamin A in the intestine.
Some soil-transmitted helminths also cause loss of appetite and, therefore, a reduction of nutritional intake and physical fitness. In particular,T. trichiuracan cause diarrhoea and dysentery.

The nutritional impairment caused by soil-transmitted helminths is recognized to have a significant impact on growth and physical development.","The main species that infect people are the roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), the whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) and hookworms (Necator americanusandAncylostoma duodenale).
Transmission: Soil-transmitted helminths are transmitted by eggs that are passed in the faeces of infected people. Adult worms live in the intestine where they produce thousands of eggs each day. In areas that lack adequate sanitation, these eggs contaminate the soil.
Transmission can happen in several ways:

Eggs that are attached to vegetables are ingested when the vegetables are not carefully cooked washed or peeled;
Eggs are ingested from contaminated water sources.
Eggs are ingested by children who play in soil and then put their hands in their mouths without washing them.

In addition, hookworm eggs hatch in the soil, releasing larvae that mature into a form that can actively penetrate the skin. People become infected with hookworm primarily by walking barefoot on the contaminated soil.
There is no direct person-to-person transmission, or infection from fresh faeces, because eggs passed in faeces need about three weeks to mature in the soil before they become infective.
Since these worms do not multiply in the human host, reinfection occurs only as a result of contact with infective stages in the environment.","STH can be diagnosed by examination of stool sample using Microscope for the presence of eggs.
In developing countries, groups at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections are often treated without a prior stool examination. Treating in this way is called preventive treatment
Some people notice infection when a worm is passed in their stool or is coughed up. If this happens, bring in the worm specimen to health care provider for diagnosis.","Anthelminthic medications (drugs that expel parasitic worms) are used for the treatment of helminthiasis.
WHO recommends periodic treatment with anthelminthic (deworming) medicines, without previous individual diagnosis to all at-risk people living in endemic (constant presence of disease in a population) areas. Treatment should be given once a year when the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections in the community is over 20%, and twice a year when the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections in the community exceeds 50%."
Hypertension (High Blood pressure),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/cardio-vascular/hypertension-high-blood-pressure,"Hypertension
Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure in blood vessels the harder the heart has to work in order to pump blood. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to a heart attack, an enlargement of the heart and eventually heart failure. Blood vessels may develop bulges (aneurysms) and weak spots due to high pressure, making them more likely to clog and burst. The pressure in the blood vessels can also cause blood to leak out into the brain. This can cause a stroke. Hypertension can also lead to kidney failure, blindness, rupture of blood vessels and cognitive impairment.
Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is recorded as two numbers usually written one above the other. The upper number is the systolic blood pressure - the highest pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts, or beats. The lower number is the diastolic blood pressure - the lowest pressure in blood vessels when the heart muscle relaxes. Normal adult blood pressure is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg.
Hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure equal to or above 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure equal to or above 90 mm Hg.
More than 1 in 5 adults worldwide have raised blood pressure – a condition that causes around half of all deaths from stroke and heart disease. Complications from hypertension account for 9.4 million deaths worldwide every year.
In nearly all high-income countries, widespread diagnosis and treatment with low-cost medication have led to a significant drop in the proportion of people with raised blood pressure as well as the average blood pressure across populations. This has contributed to a reduction in deaths from heart disease. For example, the prevalence of raised blood pressure in the WHO region of the Americas in 2014 was 18%, as compared to 31% in 1980.
In contrast, low-income countries have the highest prevalence of raised blood pressure. In the WHO African region, more than 30% of adults in many countries are estimated to have high blood pressure. This proportion is increasing and the average blood pressure levels in this region are much higher than global averages.
Many people with high blood pressure in developing countries are not aware of their disease. Those who are diagnosed may not have access to treatment and may not be able to successfully control their illness over the long term. It contributes to the burden of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure and premature mortality and disability.
Detection, treatment and control of hypertension is an important health priority worldwide.","Most hypertensive people have no symptoms at all; this is why it is known as the “silent killer”.
Sometimes hypertension causes symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations of the heart and nose bleeds. It can be dangerous to ignore such symptoms, but neither can they be relied upon to signify hypertension.
Hypertension is a serious warning sign that significant lifestyle changes are required.","Hypertension is divided into primary (essential) and secondary hypertension.
Primary or essential hypertension-When the underlying cause cannot be determined, this type of high blood pressure is called ""essential hypertension”. It accounts for 90-95% of adult cases of hypertension. It has been linked to certain risk factors. It may develop as a result of environmental or genetic causes. Obesity, diabetes, and heart disease also have genetic components and contribute to hypertension.
Secondary hypertension-When a direct cause for high blood pressure can be identified, the condition is described as secondary hypertension. About 2-10% of high blood pressure cases are due to an underlying condition or cause such as-

Renal parenchymal diseases (2.5-6%),
Vascular causes (.2-4%),
Endocrine causes (1-2%)
exogenous(administration of steroids, oral contraceptive use),
endogenous( primary hyperaldosteronism, cushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma, congenital adrenal hyperplasia),
drugs and toxins (alcohol, cocaine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAID), nicotine, decongestant containing ephedrine, herbal remedies containing licorice or ephedrine).

Other causes include pregnancy induced hypertension, Obstructive sleep apnea.
Risk factors for developing high blood pressure are-
Non-modifiable risk factors-

Family history-High blood pressure can run in a family.
Advanced age-Risk of high blood pressure increases with age.
Gender- High blood pressure is more common in young and middle aged men, while higher proportion of women suffer from hypertension late in life due to post-menopausal changes.

Modifiable risk factors-

Lack of physical activity.
Poor diet- consumption of food containing too much salt and fat, and not eating enough fruits and vegetables.
Overweight and obesity.
Heavy and too much consumption of alcohol.
Possible contributing factors- poor stress management, smoking and second hand smoke, sleep apnea.
Pre-hypertension (blood pressure slightly higher than normal) increases the risk of developing hypertension in the future.
Diabetes mellitus-About 60% of people who have diabetes also have high blood pressure.



 Blood Pressure Levels


     Normal

Systolic: less than 120 mmHg
Diastolic: less than 80 mmHg


    At Risk 
 (Pre-hypertension)

Systolic: 120–139 mmHg
Diastolic: 80–89 mmHg


    High

Systolic: 140 mmHg or higher
Diastolic: 90 mmHg or higher","All adults should know their blood pressure levels. There are different types of devices that are used to measure blood pressure. These are electronic, mercury and aneroid devices.

WHO recommends the use of affordable and reliable electronic devices that have the option to select manual readings. Semi-automatic devices enable manual readings to be taken when batteries run down.
It is recommended by WHO that mercury devices should be phased out in favour of electronic devices (as mercury is a toxic material).
Aneroid devices such as sphygmomanometers should be used only if they are calibrated every six months and users should be trained in measuring blood pressure using such devices.

Blood pressure measurements need to be recorded for several days before a diagnosis of hypertension can be made. Blood pressure is recorded twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening. Two consecutive measurements are taken, at least a minute apart and with the person seated. Measurements taken on the first day are discarded and the average value of all the remaining measurements is taken to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension.
Routine laboratory tests are also recommended before initiating therapy. These include an electrocardiogram; urine analysis; blood glucose and hematocrit; serum potassium, creatinine (or the corresponding estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR]), calcium; and a lipid profile, after 9 to12 hour fast, that includes high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides.
Digital blood pressure measurement machines can be used outside clinic settings. Self-monitoring of blood pressure is recommended for the management of hypertension in patients where measurement devices are affordable and who have limited access to health services due to geographic, physical or economic reasons.","All adults should have their blood pressure checked routinely, If blood pressure is high, they need the advice of a health worker.
For some people, lifestyle changes are sufficient to control blood pressure. For others, these changes are insufficient and they need prescription medication to control blood pressure.
Lifestyle measures:

Salt restriction - reducing salt intake to less than 5 g of salt per day(typical salt intake is 9 -12 g per day)
Limit intake of alcohol.
High consumption of vegetables and fruits and low-fat diet.
Reducing weight and maintaining it.
Regular physical exercise - hypertensive patients should participate in at least 30 min of moderate-intensity dynamic aerobic exercise (walking, jogging, cycling or swimming) on 5 to 7 days a week.
Stop Smoking and use of other tobacco products.

Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-The DASH eating plan requires no special foods and instead provides daily and weekly nutritional goals. This plan recommends:

Eating vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.
Including fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oil
Limiting foods that are high in saturated fat, such as fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils.
Limiting sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets.

When following the DASH eating plan, it is important to choose foods that are:

Low in saturated andtransfats
Rich in potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber, and protein
Lower in sodium

Antihypertensive Medicines- Antihypertensive drugs (drugs lowering the BP) work in several ways, such as removing excess salt and fluid from the body, slowing the heartbeat or relaxing and widening the blood vessels. Medicines to lower blood pressure include:

Diuretics (Water or Fluid Pills):Flush excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in blood and helps to lower your blood pressure.
Beta Blockers:Help heart to beat slower and with less force. As a result, heart pumps less blood through blood vessels, which can help to lower blood pressure.
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure.
Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs):Block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure.
Calcium Channel Blockers:Keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower blood pressure.
Alpha Blockers:Reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down.
Alpha-Beta Blockers:Reduce nerve impulses and also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down.
Central Acting Agents:Act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure.
Vasodilators:Relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure."
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/human-papillomavirus-hpv-infection-and-cervical-cancer,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of viruses that is common throughout the world. HPV is one of the causative agents in the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and women with and without clinical lesions a. HPV is transmitted through sexual contact and is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract.
The main burden of HPV-related disease is due to cervical cancer. HPV infection is a well-established cause of cervical cancer and a relevant factor in other anogenital cancers (anus, vulva, vagina and penis) and head and neck cancers. HPV is also responsible for other diseases such as recurrent juvenile respiratory papillomatosis (a disease in which tumours grow in the air passages leading from the nose and mouth into the lungs) and genital warts in men and women. Genital warts are very common and highly infectious.
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 530 000 new cases of cervical cancer globally (estimations for 2012), with approximately 270 000 deaths (representing 7.5% of all female cancer deaths). More than 85% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.
About 80% of cancer cases attributable to HPV were in developing countries. The highest estimated incidence rates for cervical cancer are in sub-Saharan Africa, Melanesia, Latin America and the Caribbean, south-central Asia and south-east Asia.
India has a population of 436.76 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Every year 122844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 67477 die from the disease (estimations for 2012). In India cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and also the second most common cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of ageb.
Based on Indian studies (performing HPV detection tests in cervical samples) about 5.0% of women in the general population are found to carry cervical HPV-16/18 infection at a given time, and 82.7% of invasive cervical cancers showed the presence of HPVs 16 or 18.(Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literatures by ICO HPV Information Centre)b.
Other epidemiological risk factors for cervical cancer are early age at marriage, multiple sexual partners, multiple pregnancies, poor genital hygiene, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives, and lack of awareness.
India also has the highest (age standardized) incidence rate as 22 (per 100,000 women per year) of cervical cancer in South Asia (estimations for 2012), compared to 19.2 in Bangladesh, 13 in Sri Lanka, and 2.8 in Iran.
HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for about 70% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide. HPV vaccines that prevent against HPV 16 and 18 infections are now available and have the potential to reduce the incidence of cervical and other anogenital cancers.","Most of the HPV infections cause no symptoms and subsides spontaneously by body’s immune system. More than 90% of infections are cleared within two years.
However persistent genital HPV infection (HPV types 16 and 18) can cause precancerous lesions in the cervix. If precancerous lesions are not treated, they may progress to cervical cancer.
This can take 15 to 20 years or more for a persistent infection with a high-risk HPV type to develop cervical cancer in women with normal immune systems. It can take only 5 to 10 years in women with weakened immune systems, such as those with untreated HIV infection.
Symptoms of cervical cancer appear only after the cancer has reached an advanced stage. 
Symptoms may be:

irregular, intermenstrual (between periods) or abnormal vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse or bleeding after menopause;
vaginal discomfort or odourous discharge from vagina, the discharge may contain some blood and may occur between periods or after menopause;
Pain during sex;
back, leg or pelvic pain;
fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite;
a single swollen leg.

More severe symptoms may develop at advanced stages of cervical cancer.
Non-cancer causing types of HPV (especially types 6 and 11) can cause genital warts and respiratory papillomatosis (a disease in which tumours grow in the air passages leading from the nose and mouth into the lungs). Although these conditions very rarely result in death, they may cause significant occurrence of disease. Genital warts are very common and highly infectious.","HPV is a member of the family Papillomaviridae. They are small, non-enveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses. They are classified according to DNA sequencing. There are more than 100 types of HPV, of which at least 13 are cancer-causing (also known as high risk type) including genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 66. The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.
The time period between the oncogenic (cancer causing) HPV infection and the invasive cervical cancer is 15–20 years. In women with weakened immune systems, such as those with untreated HIV infection, cancer can develop within five to ten years.
HPV infections usually clear up without any intervention within a few months after acquiring the infection, and about 90% clear within 2 years. A small proportion of infections with certain types of HPV can persist and progress to cancer.
Mode of transmission –
HPV is mainly transmitted through sexual contact and most people are infected with HPV shortly after the onset of sexual activity. Skin-to-skin genital contact can transmit the infection; penetrative sex is not required for transmission.
Risk factors for HPV persistence and development of cervical cancer-

Early first sexual intercourse
Multiple sexual partners
High parity
Long-term use of hormonal contraceptives
Tobacco use
Immune suppression (for example, HIV-infected individuals are at higher risk of HPV infection and are infected by a broader range of HPV types)
Low socioeconomic status, poor hygiene and diet low in antioxidants
Co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatisand Herpes simplex virus type-2","Most of the HPV infections and cervical cancer in its early stage show no clinical signs and symptoms; precancerous lesions and early cancers can be detected by screening tests. Screening is recommended for every woman from aged 30 to 49 years at least once in a lifetime and ideally more frequently (WHO).
United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines recommend testing every three years for women in age group 21-65 years; (routine cervical cancer screening for women less than 21 and over 65 years is not recommended). Five-year screening interval is recommended for women in age group 30-65 years when screening is done with a combination of Pap test and human papillomavirus (HPV) test.
Screening for cervical cancer-
There are 3 different types of screening tests-

Conventional (Pap) test and liquid-based cytology (LBC) - The Pap test is used to detect abnormal cells that may develop into cancer if left untreated. In a conventional Pap test, the specimen (or smear) is placed on a glass microscope slide and a fixative is added. In an automated liquid-based Pap cytology test, cervical cells collected with a brush or other instrument are placed in a vial of liquid preservative. One advantage of liquid-based testing is that the same cell sample can also be tested for the presence of high-risk types of HPV, a process known as “Pap and HPV co-testing.
Visual inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) - Doctor may apply a dilute acetic acid solution (vinegar solution) to the cervix, which causes abnormal areas to turn white. Further a biopsy can be taken from abnormal area.
HPV testing for high-risk HPV type- HPV testing is used to look for the presence of high-risk HPV types in cervical cells","If abnormal cells or lesions detected during screening tests, treatment is needed to excise abnormal cells or lesions. It includes cryotherapy (destroying abnormal tissue on the cervix by freezing it) or Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) when the patient is not eligible for cryotherapy.
If signs of cervical cancer are present, treatment options for invasive cancer include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy."
Heat-Related Illnesses and Heat waves,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/heat-related-illnesses-and-heat-waves,"Heat- Related Illnesses are the various manifestations of extreme heat and are increasing with increased global warming and heat waves. Periods of extreme heat that have an effect on human health are referred as heat waves. Climate change is leading to an increase in average temperatures and increased possibilities of severe heat waves. The impact of extreme summer heat on human health may be exacerbated by increase in humidity. Heat waves are an emerging public-health problem.
Extreme heat can lead to minor illnesses, such as heat rash (prickly heat), heat oedema, heat cramps, and tetany, as well as serious illnesses as heat syncope, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat stroke is the most severe form of the heat-related illness. The mortality rate among heat stroke victims is as high as one-third, and one-fifth of the heat stroke survivors suffer neurologic damage.
Heat-related illnesses include:

Heat rash (Prickly heat): small, red, papules develop in hot climate when the sweat ducts to the skin become blocked or swell, causing discomfort and itching.
Heat cramps occur in muscles after exercise in hot climate because sweating causes the body to lose water, salt, and minerals (electrolytes).
Heat oedema(swelling) in the legs and hands, can occur after sitting or standing for a long time in a hot environment.
Heat tetany is usually caused by short periods of stress in a hot environment.
Heat syncope (fainting) occurs from low blood pressure. Heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate) and body fluids move into the legs because of gravity.
Heat exhaustion(heat prostration) generally develops when a person is working or exercising in hot weather and does not drink enough liquids to replace those lost liquids.
Heat stroke (sun stroke) is a severe heat illness defined as hyperthermia with a body temperature greater than 40 °C (104°F) with neurologic dysfunction because of environmental heat exposure with lack ofthermoregulation (process by which the body maintains a steady temperature). It is also known as sun stroke.

Heat stroke is a medical emergency. Even with immediate treatment, it can be life-threatening or cause serious long-term problems.
Heat- related illness is a common problem in the tropics and with ever-increasing global warming its incidence is rising even in temperate climate. The highest incidence of heat illness of 45-1300/100000 persons is reported from Saudi Arabia.
In India, heat stroke (HS) occurs frequently in areas of northern and western India, and sporadic cases of exertional heat stroke (EHS) are reported in military recruits. In 2015, (April-June) recorded maximum temperature was 6°C to 8°C more than the average maximum temperature (mean daily maximum temperature) which resulted in 2422 human deaths due to heat wave. States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand and Delhi are mostly affected by heat wave season.
Children, elderly persons, chronically ill persons, outdoor workers, pavement and slum dwellers, street venders and rickshaw pullers are at greater risk of heat related illnesses.
Greater awareness about heat related illnesses will help in preventing, recognizing and treating these disorders at an early stage. Public education on heat illnesses, behavioural changes and restricted use of alcohol, enforced rests and fluid protocols, acclimatisation and ready availability of cooling facilities in hot areas will help in decreasing morbidity and mortality. Most heat-related illnesses can be prevented by keeping the body cool and by avoiding dehydration in hot environments.

“Guidelines for Preparation of Action Plan – Prevention and Management of Heat-Wave”, 2016 by National Disaster Management Authority, Government of India-
ndma.gov.in/images/guidelines","symptoms of various heat related illnesses are-

Heat rash (Prickly heat) - Small, red, itchy papules appear on the face, neck, upper chest, under breast, groin and scrotum areas. This can affect any age but is prevalent in young children. Infection with Staphylococcus can occur.

Heat cramps-Muscle cramping might be the early sign of heat-related illness, and may lead to heat exhaustion or stroke. Symptoms of heat cramps include profusesweatingwith involuntary spasms of the large muscles in the body.

Heat oedema is swelling of legs and hands. Older adults have an increased risk of heat oedema, especially if they have other medical conditions that affect their circulation. People visiting hot climates from colder climates may also have an increased risk of heat oedema.

Heat tetany- Symptoms may include hyperventilation, respiratory problems, numbness or tingling, or muscle spasms.

Heat syncope (fainting) – Symptoms of heat syncope include light-headedness, dizziness, fainting. Heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate), so body fluid moves into the legs by gravity and causes low blood pressure and may result in fainting.

Heat Exhaustion: symptoms are fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps and sweating; skin is pale, cool, and moist.

Heat stroke results in high body temperature 40 °C (104°F) or more, hot, red, dry skin, rapid and week pulse (tachycardia), tachypnoea (rapid breathing), nausea, hypotension, unconsciousness (delirium, seizures, stupor, confusion or coma).","As the body temperature increases, the body tries to maintain its normal temperature by transferring heat. Sweating and blood flow to the skin (Thermoregulation) help to keep body cool. A heat-related illness occurs when the body cannot transfer enough heat to keep the body cool. A high body temperature (hyperthermia) can develop rapidly in extremely hot environments.
Heat-related illnesses produce a high body temperature because the body cannot transfer heat effectively or because external heat gain is excessive.(High temperature caused by a feveris different from a high body temperature caused by a heat-related illness. A fever is the body's normal reaction to infection and other conditions).
Heat rash (Prickly heat) develops when the sweat ducts become blocked and swell. It is attributed to heavy sweating during hot and humid weather.
Heat oedema develops when heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate) and body fluid moves into the hands or legs by gravity. If salt loss is less than normal, the increased salt level draws fluid into the hands and legs. Older adults have an increased risk of heat oedema, especially if they have other medical conditions that affect their circulation. People visiting hot climates from colder climates may also have an increased risk of heat oedema.
Heat syncope occurs when heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate) in order to keep body cool; as a result blood flow to the brain is reduced causing fainting. Heat Syncope can also be caused as a result of blood collecting in the legs if an individual is standing for an extended period of time in the hot sun or as a result of doing rigorous physical activity for an extended amount of time out in the sun.
Heat exhaustion occurs when body loses body fluids and salts (sweating), when exposed to high temperatures for long periods of time. It can develop when person works or exercises in hot weather and doesn't drink enough liquids to replace the fluids lost from sweating.
Heat stroke results when the body fails to regulate its own temperature, and body temperature continues to rise. Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related disorder. It occurs when the body fails to regulate its own temperature, the body's temperature rises rapidly, the sweating mechanism fails, and the body is unable to cool down. The body temperature can rise to 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41.1 degree Celsius) or higher within 10 to 15 minutes. Heat stroke can cause death or permanent disability if prompt medical treatment is not given.
There are two forms of heat stroke:

Exertional heat stroke (EHS) generally occurs in young individuals who engage in strenuous physical activity for a prolonged period of time in a hot environment.
Classic non-exertional heat stroke (NEHS) more commonly affects sedentary elderly individuals, persons who are chronically ill and very young children during environmental heat waves. Classic NEHS is more common in areas that do not experience periods of prolonged hot weather.

Risk factors for heatstroke include male sex, sleep deprivation, obesity, poor physical conditioning, lack of acclimatization, diuretic therapy, dehydration, febrile illness, alcohol abuse, skin diseases that affect sweating, heavy protective gear, drugs impairing normal thermoregulatory response, and a past history of HS.","In most cases diagnosis is made clinically. This involves taking the temperature and assessing the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

Baseline tests should include:

Blood test for: 


Complete blood cell count- Elevated white blood cell counts are observed in patients with heatstroke and Platelet levels may be low.

Arterial blood gas testing and lactic acid analysis may reveal respiratory alkalosis due to direct central nervous system (CNS) stimulation and metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis.

Glucose- Hypoglycemia may occur in patients with EHS and in patients with fulminate hepatic failure.

Electrolytes estimation-

Sodium- Hypernatremia (increased sodium levels) may be found due to reduced fluid intake and dehydration early in the course of disease or due to diabetes insipidus. Hyponatremia (decreased sodium levels) is observed due to excessive sodium losses in sweat, patients using hypotonic solutions, such as water, and in patients using diuretics.
Potassium- Hykalemia is common in the early phase of heatstroke and with increasing muscle damage,hyperkalemia may be found.



Liver function test- Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels may rise in heat stroke.


Kidney function test- Raised serum uric acid levels, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine are common in patients whose are complicated by renal failure.

Urine test for presence of myoglobin in urine.


Muscle function test- Creatinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aldolase, and myoglobin are released from muscles when muscle necrosis occurs.
Cerebrospinal fluid analysis- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts may show a nonspecific pleocytosis and CSF protein levels may be elevated.

Imaging Studies-

Computerized tomography scans may be helpful in ruling out central nervous system (CNS) injury in patients with altered mental status.
Chest radiographs may show atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary infarction, or pulmonary edema.

Other Tests-

Electrocardiography: Sinus tachycardia of 130-140 beats per minute and nonspecific and ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities are common.","Heat rash-

Rash subsides with no specific treatment.
Minimize sweating by staying in an air-conditioned environment, taking frequent showers and wearing light clothes.
Keep the affected area dry. Topical antihistamine and antiseptic preparations can be used to reduce discomfort and prevent itching.

Heat cramps-Treatment of heat cramps include rest, cooling the body, oral hydration, and stretching the muscles that are cramping. Medical attention should be sought if heat cramps are sustained for more than one hour.
Heat oedema- Treatment is not required as oedema usually subsides following acclimatization. Diuretics are not advised and avoid the heat as much as possible.
Heat syncope-The patient should rest in a cool place and be placed in a supine position with legs and hips elevated to increase venous return. Other serious causes of syncope need to be ruled out.
Heat exhaustion:

Move the patient to a cool, shaded room or air-conditioned place.
The patient should be undressed.
Apply cold wet sheet or spray cold water and use fan if available.
Lay the patient down and raise his or her legs and hips to increase venous return.
Start oral hydration. If nausea prevents oral intake of fluids, consider intravenous hydration.
If hyperthermia is above 39°C or impaired mental status or sustained hypotension occurs, treat as heatstroke and transfer the patient to hospital.

Heat stroke-

Measure core temperature (rectal probe): if &gt; 40°C, move to a cooler place,
remove clothing,
Initiate external cooling: cold packs on the neck, axillae and groin, continuous fanning (or keep ambulance windows open) while skin is sprayed with water at 25–30°C,
position an unconscious patient on his or her side,
clear airway to minimize risk of aspiration,
administer oxygen 4 l/min and isotonic crystalloid (normal saline) solution,
transfer rapidly to the medical emergency department."
"Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease",https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a communicable disease mostly affects infants and children but can also occur in adolescents and adults. It is an acute viral infection caused by a group of enteroviruses, including Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and Enterovirus 71 (EV71). The disease is usually mild characterized by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. Infection with EV71 can cause severe disease in children, sometimes resulting in death.
Though the outbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide but in recent years these have occurred more in Asia including: China, Japan, Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan (China) and Viet Nam.
HFMD was first reported in India from Calicut (Kerala) in 2003, thereafter outbreaks were reported from Nagpur (Maharashtra), Jorhat (Assam), Kolkata (West Bengal), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Udaipur (Rajasthan), Leh (Jammu and Kashmir).
HFMD is not to be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also called hoof-and-mouth disease), which occurs in animals (cattle, sheep, and pigs) by a different virus and do not transmit to humans.","HFMD is usually a mild disease. Symptoms may appear in 3-7 days after getting infection (this period is termed as incubation period).

The first symptom is fever lasting for 24-48 hours, with poor appetite, malaise and sore throat
One or two days after fever onset, painful sores appear on the tongue, gums and inside the cheeks. Initially these are small red spots that blister and then ulcerate.
A non-itchy rash develops over one to two days on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; may appear on the buttocks and /or genitalia. Almost all patients recover in 7 to 10 days without any complications.
Some persons with HFMD may not show any symptoms or may have only rash or only mouth ulcers.
HFMD caused by EV71 has been associated with meningitis and encephalitis and may show mixed neurological (headache, stiff neck, or back pain) and respiratory symptoms. In HFMD due to EV71 complications may be serious with fatal outcome. 

HFMD in pregnant women:
No adverse outcome of pregnancy (such as abortion, stillbirth or congenital defects) is observed when pregnant women are infected with HFMD; however pregnant women may pass the virus to the baby if they are infected shortly before delivery or have symptoms at the time of delivery.
Most newborns infected with an enterovirus have mild illness, but the risk of severe illness may be higher in newborns infected during the first two weeks of life.","HFMD is caused by group of viruses called enteroviruses. There are different types of viruses in this group that include polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and other enteroviruses. The common viruses causing HFMD are coxsackievirus A16 resulting in mild self limiting disease with few complications and enterovirus 71 (EV71) which has been associated with serious complication and is fatal.
Transmission of infection:

HFMD virus is contagious.
Nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons are the infective materials.
Infection spreads from person to person by direct contact with these infective materials.
Infected persons are most contagious during the first week of the illness but can remain infectious up to several weeks (as the virus persists in stool).
Children younger than 5 years of age are most commonly affected by the disease.
Most adults are immune but cases in adolescents and adults may also occur. Immunity developed after an infection is virus specific and a second episode of HFMD may occur following infection with a different member of the enterovirus group.

HFMD is not transmitted to or from pets or other animals.","The diagnosis of HFMD is based on clinical examination. Samples for virology investigation from the throat swabs, vesicles, rectal swab/ stool or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be collected and sent to a laboratory to test for the virus.

Reverse transcription by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the virus in the samples.
Four-fold rise in antibody titer in paired blood sample shows confirmation of the disease.","In most cases, HFMD is a self-limiting illness, with the majority of children recovering spontaneously with symptomatic treatment as:

Ensure adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration. Cold liquids are generally preferable.
Spicy or acidic substances may cause discomfort.
Fever may be treated with antipyretics.
Mouthwashes or sprays that numb pain can be used to lessen mouth pain.
Seek prompt medical care for children showing severe symptoms."
Hypermetropia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/hypermetropia,"Hypermetropia (hyperopia, long-sightedness or far- sightedness) is a form of refractive error in which parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused behind the light sensitive layer of the retina, when the eye is at rest.
Donders (1864) discusses in his historical review about hypermetropia. Much of the problem was caused by confusion between the effects of presbyopia and hypermetropia on near vision.
Small hypermetropia may be corrected by voluntary accommodation. Even high errors of refraction may be corrected this way, but convex glasses may be required if symptoms are not relieved.
Emmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive error (ametropia) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays, resulting in blurred images. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.
In hypermetropia, the cornea is flatter or the axial length is too short. Therefore, the images do not focus by the time they reach to the retina. For clear vision, a hypermetropic eye must accommodate to increase its lenticular power to bring distant objects in focus on retina. This requires contraction of ciliary muscle, and therefore, far-sighted eye is never at rest and work even harder to see near objects clearly. Hypermetropic corrections add positive focusing power to the eye for clear vision.
Accommodation: The degree of hypermetropia corrected by accommodative effort is known as facultative hypermetropia. Remaining uncorrected hypermetropia is called absolute hypermetropia. Total hypermetropia after abolishing voluntary accommodation is known as manifest hypermetropia (facultative plus absolute). With advancing age, accommodative effort cannot be sustained, and hypermetropia becomes absolute till the effort of accommodation fails to correct any hypermetropia. Thus the facultative hypermetropia becomes abolished and there remains no difference between absolute and manifest hypermetropia.
Some of the hypermetropia is corrected by the inherent tone of the ciliary muscles and this is called latent hypermetropia. The degree of latent hypermetropia is high in young persons and becomes less with advancing age. Complete cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation) can abolish latent hypermetropia. The refractive error estimated under complete cycloplegia is called total hypermetropia (manifest plus latent).","The symptoms vary depending upon the age of the patient and the severity of refractive error. Patient may be asymptomatic. Small amount of refractive error in young patients is usually corrected by mild accommodative effort, without producing any symptoms.
Symptomatic patients may present with:
When hypermetropia is fully corrected: At times the hypermetropia is fully corrected (thus vision is normal) but due to sustained accommodative efforts the patient develops asthenopic symptoms.

Asthenopia (eyestrain).
Frontal or fronto-temporal headache.
Watering.
Mild aversion to light.

These symptoms worsen as the day progresses and are aggravated by prolonged near work.
When hypermetropia is not fully corrected: When hypermetropia is not fully corrected by the voluntary accommodative efforts, then the patient complains of defective vision more for near than distance, due to sustained accommodative effort. Patient present with:

Asthenopia.
Defective vision more for near.

When hypermetropia is high: When hypermetropia is high (more than 4 D), the patients usually do not accommodate and they suffer with:

Marked defective vision for both near and distance.

When there is more of absolute hypermetropia: With ageing the eye move from latent and facultative hypermetropia to greater degrees of absolute hypermetropia. This leads to progressive defective vision. Patient present with:

Blurring of vision at a younger age than in emmetrope.

When there is Spasm of accommodation: Spasm of accommodation may induce pseudo-myopia. It may be detected by cycloplegic refraction. It presents as:

Intermittent sudden blurring of vision.

In general, child may also present with lid diseases (like blepharitis, stye or chalazion), convergent squint or amblyopia.","Hypermetropia may be:

Axial hypermetropia: Axial hypermetropia is the commonest type. The total refractive power of the eye is normal but there is axial shortening of the eyeball. About 1 mm shortening of the antero-posterior length of the eye results in about 3 Dioptres (D) of hypermetropia.
Curvature hypermetropia: Curvature hypermetropia is that condition in which curvature of the cornea, lens or both is increased (flatter) than the normal, resulting in change in refractive power of the eye. About 1 mm increase in radius of curvature results in 6 D of hypermetropia.
Index Hypermetropia: Index Hypermetropia occurs due to change in refractive index of the crystalline lens with age.
Positional hypermetropia: Positional hypermetropia results from posteriorly placed crystalline lens of the eye.
Absence of crystalline lens: Absence of crystalline lens either congenital absence or acquired (following surgical removal or posterior displacement) leads to aphakia. There is high hypermetropia in aphakia.


It may also be functional, as is seen in presbyopia or may be induced by cycloplegic drugs.","Diagnosis of hypermetropia is based on the symptoms and clinical signs observed.
Clinical signs:

Visual acuity: Visual acuity varies with degree of hypermetropia and power of accommodation. Patients with low degree of refractive error may have normal visual acuity. However, there is decrease in visual acuity for seeing near objects.
Cover test: Cover test reveals an accommodative convergent squint. Due to altered accommodative convergence (AC) and accommodation (A) balance (AC/A ratio), maintaining binocular vision becomes difficult. The advantages of binocular vision are sacrificed in favour of more obvious advantages of clear vision. The better eye dominates for vision and the other eye develops accommodative convergent squint.
Eyelids: One may develop blepharitis, stye or chalazion. The correlation between lid conditions and hypermetropia is not clear.
Eyeball: Size of the eyeball may be normal or small.
Cornea: Cornea may also be slightly smaller in size. There may be associated condition of cornea plana (flat cornea).
Anterior chamber: Anterior chamber is relatively shallow in high hypermetropia.
Glaucoma: The eye is small in high hypermetropia along with small size of cornea and shallow anterior chamber. Due to increase in size of the lens with ageing, the eye becomes prone to an attack of narrow angle closure glaucoma.
Lens: Lens may be dislocated backwards.
Fundus: Fundus examination shows small optic disc which may look hyperaemic (vascular) with ill- defined margins. This appearance may simulate papillitis. Since there is no swelling of the disc, it is called pseudo-papillitis. The retina is shiny due to reflection of light, called as shot silk appearance. Reflex of retinal vessels may be accentuated simulating arteriosclerotic changes. Vessels may be tortuous and may show abnormal branching.
Ultrasonography or biometry: A- scan ultrasonography or biometry may show decreased antero- posterior length of the eyeball.

Severity of hypermetropia:
Based on severity, hypermetropia may be classified as:

Low: Up to + 2 D.
Moderate: From + 2.25 to 5 D.
High: More than + 5 D, and rarely it exceeds 6 – 7 D, which is equivalent to 2 mm shortening of the optic axis. Individual cases of much higher degrees (e.g. up to 24 D), without any other associated anomaly have been recorded.

Clinical types of hypermetropia:
I. Simple hypermetropia: Simple hypermetropia is the commonest type. It includes axial and curvature hypermetropia due to biological variations in the development of the eye. It may be hereditary.
II. Pathological hypermetropia: Pathological type is due to congenital or acquired conditions outside the normal biological variation of development. It may be

Senile or acquired hypermetropia: It occurs in old age due to

- Curvature hypermetropia: There is decreased curvature of the outer lens fibres with ageing.
- Index hypermetropia: It is due to acquired sclerosis of the cortex (outer part) of crystalline lens. In young age, refraction of the cortex is less than nucleus (central part) of the lens. This inequality results in formation of a central lens surrounded by two converging menisci. This increases the refracting power of the lens. With ageing, this differentiation diminishes and the lens becomes more homogeneous with reduced converging power.

Positional hypermetropia: It may occur due to posterior subluxation (partial dislocation) of the lens.
Aphakic hypermetropia: Aphakia is the displacement of the lens from its normal pupillary position in the eye. It may be congenital or acquired condition. The eye is hypermetropic with marked defective vision for near and distance. On an average there is need of + 10 or + 11 D lens for correction.
Consecutive hypermetropia: It is due to surgically overcorrected myopia or pseudo-phakia (eye with intraocular lens following removal of crystalline lens as in cataract surgery) with under-correction.

III. Functional hypermetropia: It results from paralysis of accommodation as is seen in patients with third intracranial nerve palsy and internal ophthalmoplegia.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical optical therapy:
Assessment of Vision:
The most common component of assessment of visual function is to test central vision through visual acuity. Visual acuity determines ability to read symbols of varying sizes at a standard testing distance. This reference distance approximates optical infinity and is typically 6 meters. A 6/6 letter on the standard eye chart devised by Snellen is considered normal visual acuity. Refractive errors may result in uncorrected visual acuities that fall below 6/6. In the absence of other diseases, the condition of hypermetropia may be corrected with restoration of normal visual function. This may be achieved with spectacles or contact lenses.
Basic principle of therapy is to converge and focus the light rays on the retina with the help of convex (plus) glasses.
Rules for prescribing glasses in hypermetropia:

Cycloplegia: Total hypermetropia is determined by performing refraction (checking power of glasses) under complete cycloplegia.
Small total manifest hypermetropia: For small total manifest hypermetropia e.g. 1 D or less, correction may be required only if the patient is symptomatic.
Spherical power: Spherical power is prescribed to the extent that it is suitably acceptable to the patient.
Astigmatism: Astigmatism should be fully corrected.
Children younger than 4 years: Children younger than 4 years requiring hypermetropic correction may usually accept full cycloplegic correction. It may be reduced in older children.
Older children: Older children may not accept full cycloplegic correction because of the blur for distance. It may be increased gradually till the child accepts for the manifest hypermetropia.
Exophoria: Hypermetropia should be under-corrected by about 1- 2 D if there is associated exophoria.
Accommodative convergent squint: Full cycloplegic correction should be given if there is accommodative convergent squint.
Amblyopia (lazy eye): In the presence of associated amblyopia (Functionally reduced vision not correctable with glasses and is not due to any eye disease) in one eye, full correction with occlusion therapy should be given.
Growth of child: Hypermetropia decreases with growth of the child. Periodic refraction should be conducted and the correction should be reduced accordingly.

Prescription of convex power:

Spectacles: Convex lenses may be prescribed as spectacles.
Contact lenses: Contact lenses may be prescribed for cosmetic reasons once the refractive power of the eye stabilises. Contact lenses may be prescribed for unilateral hypermetropia as well.


Surgical therapy:
It may be

Non- contact Holmium:YAG laser thermokeratoplasty: Non- contact Holmium:YAG laser thermokeratoplasty is suitable for hypermetropia of about + 1 D to + 2.5 D. With this, multiple radially distributed spots are produced in the para-central cornea, which leads to shrinkage of the collagen in the mid- peripheral stroma and consequent steepening of the central cornea.
Hypermetropic photorefractive keratectomy (H- PRK): The principle of this procedure is to steepen the anterior corneal curvature. The cornea is sculpted in to a steeper convex lens by creating a furrow- like ring zone in the corneal periphery.
Conductive keratoplasty: Conductive keratoplasty is a non-invasive procedure in which radiofrequency is used to correct low hypermetropia with or without astigmatism. It may also be used to correct residual refractive error after cataract surgery or laser assisted in- situ keratomileusis.
Hypermetropic laser assisted in- situ keratomileusis (LASIK): It is used to correct mild- to- moderate hypermetropia varying from + 1 D to + 4 D.
Phakic intraocular lens (IOL) implants: Phakic intraocular lens (IOL) implants are used to correct higher degrees of hypermetropia, varying from about + 4 D to + 10 D. Phakic IOLs are especially designed, foldable, convex, thin lenses implanted in the posterior chamber behind the iris and in front of the normal crystalline lens.
Refractive lens exchange: Extraction of clear lens with implantation of an IOL, preferably foldable IOL or a piggyback IOL. In piggyback IOL, two IOLs are placed in the eye one on top of the other. This is done if the biometry is + 40 D or so, and one does not have a lens of high power to implant. Moreover, there is high level of spherical aberration with thick lenses.


Prognosis:
Asymptomatic children up to about 10 years with low to moderate hypermetropia usually do not require any glasses. Visual acuity decreases as the child grows due to loss of accommodation.
Hypermetropia decreases quality of life. Poor vision may also decrease in the ability to learn and develop. Hypermetropia that is not fully compensated with accommodation may produce complications."
Heterophoria,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/heterophoria,"Heterophoria or latent squint is defined as a condition in which eyes in the primary position or in their movement are maintained on the fixation point under stress only, with the aid of corrective fusion reflexes. When the influence of fusion is removed, the visual axis of one eye deviates.
Orthophoria is characterised by perfect alignment of two eyes in all positions of gaze and at all fixation distances so that the visual axes are parallel for distance and have proper convergence for near. Orthophoria as such is a rarity. A small amount of heterophoria is usually present.
George T Stevens (1886) introduced the term heterophoria and defined it as an abnormal adjustment of the eye muscles, or a tending of the visual lines in some other direction than parallelism, which applies to strabismus as well. In heterophoria binocular vision is habitually maintained, but by the expenditure of a greater amount of force than is demanded in the perfect equilibrium of the ocular muscles. Thus, deviation is kept latent by the fusion mechanism. In strabismus, diplopia is present and to overcome this, there is long suppression of one image. Therefore, the dividing line between heterophoria and strabismus rests on the ability or failure to maintain binocular vision.
The term heterophoria is derived from a Greek word, heteros meaning other, different from; and phoria meaning bringing, comparing.
All the anomalies of ocular alignment are divided into two classes

Latent deviation.
Manifest deviation.

In heterophoria there is relative deviation of the visual axis held in check by a fusion mechanism and when this mechanism is disrupted the phoria breaks into tropia (squint) and thus the deviation becomes manifest.","Depending upon the symptoms, heterophoria may be divided into compensated and de-compensated types.
I. Compensated heterophoria: It is not associated with any symptoms. Compensation depends upon the reserve neuromuscular power to overcome the muscular imbalance.
II. De-compensated heterophoria: Symptoms arise when the fusion amplitudes are inadequate to control deviation. Even debilitating illness may precipitate symptoms in a previously asymptomatic patient. It is associated with symptoms such as

Symptoms of muscular fatigue: These result due to continuous use of reserve neuromuscular power. Common symptoms are

- Headache.
- Asthenopia (eyestrain).
- Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light).
- Difficulty in changing focus from near to distance and vice versa.

Symptoms due to failure in maintaining binocular single vision (BSV): These are

- Blurring of vision.
- Crowding of words while reading.
- Difficulty with stereopsis.
- Intermittent diplopia.
- Intermittent squint without diplopia.

Symptoms due to defective postural sensations: These causes

- Problem in judging distances and positions, especially of objects in motion.","Causes of heterophoria are grouped as

Static causes or anatomical factors: Anatomical factors causing heterophoria include

- Orbital asymmetry: May be due to size, orientation and shape of orbits.
- Interpupillary distance (IPD) abnormalities: Wide IPD is associated with exophoria and small IPD with esophoria.
- Size and shape of globes.
- Abnormal strength or structure of extra-ocular muscles.
- Volume of retro-bulbar tissue, orbital fascias and ligaments.
- Anomalous central distribution of the tonic innervations of eyes.
- Variation to the optical axis of the eye.

Kinetic causes (physiological factors): These may be

- Age: Esophoria is common in younger age groups as compared to exophoria. Exophoria is more often seen in elderly group.
- Convergence: Excessive use of convergence may cause esophoria as is seen in bilateral congenital myopes. Decreased use of convergence leads to exophoria as is present in presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).
- Accommodation: Increased accommodation leads to esophoria as is seen in hypermetropia (far-sightedness) and also in individuals doing excessive near work. Decreased accommodation is associated with exophoria as is seen in simple myopia.
- Dissociation factors: Prolonged constant use of one eye may result in exophoria. This is seen in people using uniocular microscope and in watchmakers using uniocular magnifying glass.

Neurogenic causes: Lower motor neuron disease leads to incomitant heterophoria (deviations which vary with the direction of gaze) and upper motor neuron disease leads to comitant heterophoria (deviations are same in all directions of gaze for a particular fixation distance).


Risk factors for de-compensated heterophoria include

General debility and lowered vitality.
Mental stress.
Inadequacy of fusion reserve.
Advancing age.
Precision jobs.

Sensorial adaptations such as abnormal retinal correspondence and suppression of image may develop to avoid foveal diplopia. Intermittent heterotropia is heterophoria breaking into heterotropia. In this, patient sometimes has heterophoria and sometimes heterotropia.","There are different methods for diagnosis of heterophorias. There is no reason to believe that heterophorias are of smaller magnitude as compared to heterotropia. Heterophoria may be as large as 25˚ and heterotropia may be as small as 5˚ (microtropia). Nature of deviation depends upon the degree of fusion amplitude.
Examination of patient comprises of detailed history and determination of refractive error (retinoscopy) under cycloplegia. Ocular movements should also be tested in all positions of gaze. Important tests in the evaluation of heterophoria include

Cover- Uncover test: It should be performed for both distance and near. One eye of the patient is covered while fixating with other eye at a distant target. The eye is then uncovered and any movement of the eye to take up fixation is noted. The test is repeated with other eye. The direction of deviation, the degree of deviation and speed of recovery is noted. If the right eye is deviated while under cover, a re-fixation movement (recovery to BSV) is observed on being uncovered. Adduction of the right eye indicates exophoria and abduction esophoria. Upward or downward movement indicates a vertical phoria. After the cover is removed, the speed and smoothness of recovery indicates the strength of motor fusion.
Alternate cover test: The alternate cover test induces dissociation to reveal total deviation when fusion is disrupted. It is performed after cover-uncover test. The occluder is shifted quickly back and forth from one eye to other, several times. After the cover is removed, the speed and smoothness of recovery is noted as the eyes return to their pre- dissociated state. A patient with well compensated heterophoria will have straight eyes before and after the test has been performed, whereas a patient with poor control may decompensate to manifest deviation.
Maddox rod test: The Maddox rod consists of a series of fused cylindrical red glass rods that convert the appearance of a white spot of light in to a red streak. The optical property of rod causes the streak of light to be at an angle of 90˚ with the long axis of the rods. The Maddox rod is placed in front of one eye and patient fixates with both eyes on a spot of light. The patient is asked whether the streak produced by Maddox rod passes through the fixation light seen by the other eye. When rod is placed horizontally, a vertical streak is produced and it gives an idea about exophoria or esophoria. But a vertically placed rod produce horizontal streak, and it delineates hyper- or hypophoria. Prisms may be inserted in front of one eye to make the streak pass through the point of fixation, which estimates the degree of error. Maddox tangent scale placed at one meter or five meters may be used to measure degree of heterophoria directly from the scale.
Maddox wing test: This is used to measure degree of heterophoria at near fixation. The instrument is constructed in such a way that the right eye sees only a white vertical arrow and a red horizontal arrow, whereas the left eye sees only horizontal and vertical rows of numbers. Patient rests the front piece of Maddox wing on nose and looks through the slit in eyepieces. Right eye of patient sees white scale and the left eye sees arrow. The number on scale through which white arrow passes, gives the measurement of horizontal heterophoria. Similarly, reading on vertical scale measures vertical phorias. Cyclophoria may be found by adjusting shaft of red arrow parallel to the horizontal scale.
Synoptophore: This may also be used to measure degree of heterophoria.
Near point of convergence: The near point of convergence is the nearest point on which the eyes can maintain binocular fixation. It may be measured with royal air force (RAF) rule, which rests on cheeks of patient. A target is slowly moved along the rule towards the eyes of patient until one eye loses fixation and drifts laterally. The subjective near point of convergence is the point at which the patient reports diplopia. Normally, the near point of convergence should be nearer than 10 centimeter without undue effort.
Near point of accommodation: The near point of accommodation is the nearest point on which the eyes can maintain clear focus. It may also be measured with the RAF rule. The patient fixates a line of print, which is then slowly moved towards the patient until it becomes blurred. The distance at which blurring is reported first is read off the rule and it denotes the near point of accommodation. The near point of accommodation recedes with age. When near point of accommodation recedes sufficiently far away to render reading difficult without optical correction, presbyopia is present.
Measurement of fusion reserves: Fusion amplitudes measure the efficacy of vergence movements. These may be tested with prisms bars or the synoptophore. An increasingly strong prism is placed in front of one eye, which then abduct or adduct (depending on whether the prism is base-in or base-out), in order to maintain bifoveal fixation. When a prism of greater than fusion amplitude is reached, diplopia occurs or one eye drifts in the opposite direction, indicating the limit of vergence ability.
Assessment of binocular vision.


Clinical types of heterophoria: These are

Exophoria: It is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to diverge, which is checked by fusion amplitudes. It is a passive process unlike esophoria (which is an active process). An exophoria of less than 9 prism dioptres is usually not significant. There are three types of exophoria

- Divergence excess type.
- Basic type.
- Convergence weakness type.

Esophoria: It is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to deviate inwards, which is held in check by fusion impulses. It is either due to hypermetropic refractive error or high accommodative convergence/ accommodation (AC/A) ratio or increased amount of near work. There are three types of esophorias.

- Convergence excess type.
- Basic type.
- Divergence weakness type.

Hyperphoria: Hyperphoria is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to deviate upwards in a vertical direction, which is held in check by fusion amplitudes.
Hypophoria: Hypophoria is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to deviate downwards in a vertical direction, which is held in check by fusion amplitudes.
Cyclophoria: Cyclophoria is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to rotate around their sagittal axis (antero-posterior), which is held in check by fusion amplitudes. This can be

- Incyclophoria: Incyclophoria is characterised by inward rotation of the upper pole of the cornea.
- Excyclophoria: Excyclophoria is characterised by outward rotation of the upper pole of the cornea.

Anisophoria: Anisophoria is that type of heterophoria in which the degree of muscular imbalance varies with the direction of conjugate gaze.


Differential diagnosis:
Heterophoria should be differentiated from heterotropias.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Management is indicated for decompensated heterophoria. Lesser degrees of heterophoria without any symptoms require no treatment except for correction of refractive error, if present.
Medical therapy
I. Optical: 

Esophoria: 

- Full correction of the refractive error is given to the patient when refraction shows significant amount of hypermetropia (+1.25 dioptres or more).
- Patients with high AC/A ratio and a symptomatic esophoria without hypermetropia may be treated with miotics or bifocal glasses.
- Base-out prisms for visual comfort in patients with non-accommodative esophoria. To prevent total inactivity of fusion divergence mechanism, one-half to one-third only of the angle of deviation is corrected. This does not correct underlying cause of latent deviation. It is used mainly in elderly patients with symptomatic esophoria who do not respond to orthoptic treatment. It may also be used in younger patients prior to surgery.

Exophoria:

- Patients without asthenopia do not require any treatment.
- Significant refractive errors, especially anisometropia, aniseikonia, aphakia, intraocular lens (IOL) with wrong power (pseudophakia), and astigmatism, should be treated to produce sharp retinal images which increase stimulus to fuse. Hypermetropia of less than 2 Dioptres may be left uncorrected in children, though in older patients this needs to be corrected to avoid asthenopia. Presbyopia patients are given the weakest bifocal lenses which provide comfortable near vision. Half of exodeviation may be treated with base-in prisms for near vision. Myopic errors are fully corrected.
- Minus lenses may decrease exodeviation in patients with high AC/A ratio.
- In younger children with convergence insufficiency exodeviation, minus lenses as lower segment bifocals may be tried, as a temporary measure. In divergence excess exodeviation, minus lenses as upper segment bifocals may be tried.
- Prisms may be used for postoperative overcorrection of exodeviation. It is sometimes used preoperatively to enforce bifoveal stimulation.

Hyperphoria:

- Prisms in glasses may also be tried in selective cases of hyperphoria. The prism is prescribed with the apex toward the direction of hyperphoria to correct one-half or at the most two-third of heterophoria only.
II. Orthoptics:
This is the mainstay of treatment. Patients with moderate degrees of exophoria or esophoria who have fair degree of binocular function, orthoptic execises are the treatment of choice. Patients with convergence insufficiency are given convergence exercises on synoptophore. Likewise, patient with divergence insufficiency are given divergence exercises.
III. Miotic drugs:
Miotic drugs may be useful in near esophoria due to high AC/A ratio. These facilitate peripheral accommodation so that less than normal innervation is required and consequently less than normal accommodative convergence occurs.

Surgical therapy:
This is indicated in patients with intermittent exotropia who show signs of worsening in the form of

Exotropia lasts for more than 50% of the waking hours.
There are symptoms of asthenopia or diplopia.
Patient develops abnormal retinal correspondence or suppression.
There is decrease in stereo-acuity.
There is development of secondary convergence insufficiency.
There is increase in deviation.

The aim of surgical procedure is to strengthen the weak muscle or to weaken the strong muscle. Elderly patients should be treated conservatively due to decreased fusion capacity. Younger patients with small surgical overcorrection may be easily treated by fusion convergence since the fusion capacity is good.
Surgical procedures which may be performed are

Bi-medial recession: Bi-medial recession is done in cases of convergence excess.
Bilateral resection: Bilateral resection is done in cases of divergence insufficiency."
Hypervitaminosis A,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/hypervitaminosis-a,"Hypervitaminosis A usually results from chronic and excessive intake, generally for weeks or months together, of preformed vitamin A (as retinol or its esterified form). Excessive use of food supplements containing vitamin A, or food fads of intake of organ meat may be the cause. Toxicity is produced with chronic intake of 6000μg of vitamin A in children, and 15000μg of vitamin A in adults.
Josephs HW first described the condition of hypervitaminosis A in 1944. 
Symptoms of hypervitaminosis A may subside rapidly on withdrawal of vitamin, but the rate at which improvement takes place depends upon the amount of vitamin A already built up in the tissues. Hypervitaminosis A may prove fatal in extreme cases. Hypervitaminosis A has no antidote. Thus, prevention plays an important role to avoid toxicity.
Except for vitamin A, toxicity from excess intake of vitamins, in general, is less common. Excessive intake of carotene (precursor of vitamin A) may lead to pigmentation of skin (hypercarotenosis).

High risk pregnancy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/high-risk-pregnancy,"Pregnancy(gestation) is the physiological process of a developing fetus within the maternal body. The term high risk pregnancy is used by health care providers to demarcate a pregnancy in which a mother, her foetus or both are at higher risk of developing complications during pregnancy or child birth than in a normal pregnancy. Women with high-risk pregnancies should receive care from a special team of health care providers to ensure the best possible outcomes.
High risk pregnancy may result because of various conditions which are there either before getting pregnant such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and complications from a previous pregnancy, or conditions during pregnancy or delivery.
In India about 20-30% pregnancies belong to high risk category, which is responsible for 75% of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Early detection and effective management of high risk pregnancy can contribute substantially in reduction of maternal and foetal adverse outcomes.
Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matriva Abhiyan is an initiative of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India to identify high risk pregnancies early and follow them so that they can be referred to health care centers with proper facilities so that women with high risk pregnancies may have healthy pregnancies and deliveries without complications.","If some conditions are associated with pregnancy than it is listed as high risk pregnancy* such as

Severe anemia Hb (haemoglobin) less than 7gm/dl
Pregnancy induced hypertension, preeclampsia,
Syphilis, HIV positive
Gestational diabetes mellitus
Hypothyroidism
Young primi (less than 20 years), or elderly gravida (more than 35 years)

Palpitations, easy fatigability and breathlessness at rest
Pain in abdomen
Vaginal bleeding / watery discharge
Reduced fetal movements","Though any pregnancy could develop complications during or after pregnancy and child birth, but a pregnancy with high risk factor poses higher than normal risk for the pregnant women and fetus.
Some common high risk conditions of pregnancy are:
Maternal age: Early childbearing is a risk for both mother and new born. Adolescent mothers (ages 10 to 19 years) face higher risks of eclampsia, puerperal endometritis, and systemic infections than women aged 20 to 24 years. And newborns can have higher risks of low birthweight, preterm delivery, and severe neonatal problems.
Advanced maternal age (defined as childbearing in a woman over 35 years of age) is reported to be associated with various pregnancy complications such as risk of stillbirth, foetal growth restriction, an increased risk of caesarean birth, premature birth, birth defects, multiple births, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, preeclampsia.
Medical conditions that exist before pregnancy, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases or being HIV positive, kidney diseases, autoimmune diseases, thyroid diseases can present risks for the mother and/or her unborn baby.
Medical condition that occur during pregnancy may affect pregnancy and outcome such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, placenta previa, polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios.
Multiple births.The risk of complications is higher in women carrying more than one fetus (twins and higher-order multiples). Common complications include preeclampsia, premature labor, and preterm birth.
Obesity.Being obese before pregnancy is associated with a number of risks for poor pregnancy outcomes.
Alcohol, tobacco and substance use-Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can increase the baby’s risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), sudden infant death syndrome, and other problems. Smoking during pregnancy may cause fetus at risk for preterm birth, birth defects, sudden infant death. Secondhand smoke also puts a woman and her developing fetus at increased risk for health problems.
Zika infection: Infection with zika just before and during pregnancy is a risk factor for different problems with the brain and nervous system of foetus, pregnancy loss and stillbirth.","During antenatal visits following points are important during examination :

A careful history from pregnant woman to reveal specific risk factors
A maternal physical examination to identify or exclude risk factors
Routine maternal laboratory tests for common disorders
Special maternal laboratory tests for disorders suggested by any evaluative process
Comprehensive fetal assessment by obstetric ultrasound or an assortment of techniques over the entire course of the pregnancy","Management of high-risk pregnancy depends on the woman’s specific risk factors. In a high-risk pregnancy, healthcare providers keep a close watch on the woman and the pregnancy to detect any potential problems as quickly as possible so that treatment can start before the woman’s or fetus’s health is in danger.
Following conditions are listed to level as high risk pregnancy*

Severe anemia Hb less than 7gm/dl
Pregnancy induced hypertension, preeclampsia,
Syphilis, HIV positive
Gestational diabetes mellitus
Hypothyroidism
Young primi (less than 20 years), or elderly gravida (more than 35 years)

Under PMSMA, high risk cases get additional counseling on ‘where to go for regular checkup and institutional delivery, whom to contact during emergency’, and the contact details for assured transport. All high risk cases should be advised to visit the health facility near term in order to plan her delivery.
The main objective of the campaign is to ensure that all high risk pregnant women are detected early and provided timely and quality treatment ensure a healthy mother and a baby. PMSMA centers’ linking with comprehensive emergency obstetric and new born care (CEmONC) facilities is of utmost importance to ensure assured referral of all High risk pregnant women to appropriate facilities- first referral units (FRUs) and follow up on the outcomes."
Ichthyosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/ichthyosis,"Ichthyosis is a generalized, mostly genetic disorder of the skin. All types of ichthyosis have dry, thickened, scaly or flaky skin. There is no cure, but symptoms are usually mild and manageable with a daily skin care routine. The severity of symptoms can vary extremely, from the mildest types such as ichthyosis vulgaris which may be mistaken for normal dry skin up to life-threatening conditions such as harlequin type ichthyosis. The most common type of ichthyosis is ichthyosis vulgaris, accounting for more than 95% of cases.","The symptoms specific to each type of inherited ichthyosis are given below:
Ichthyosis vulgaris

The skin here appear normal during birth
It usually begins gradually before the age of one and is characterized by dry, rough and scaly skin
Elbows, knees and the face are not usually affected
Limbs may develop fine, light grey scales
The skin on palm of the hands and sole of the feet may have more lines than normal and be thickened
The child often also has eczema
Symptoms are more prominent during winters

X-linked ichthyosis

Scales are present at or shortly after birth
Males are generally affected
May be associated with testicular disease

Lamellar ichthyosis

It is seen in babies
Baby is covered in a thick membrane at birth, which is then shed
Scales are present which affects whole body
The child may also have drooping lower eyelids (ectropion)

Epidermolytic ichthyosis

The skin is moist, red and tender at birth with blistering
Thick scaling occurs as the baby grows

Acquired ichthyosis tends to develop in adulthood and is not inherited. 
It's usually associated with another disease such as:

An underactive thyroid
kidney disease
lymphoma (a type of cancer)
HIV infection",Inherited Ichthyosis is caused by mutations in genes passed on to the child by both parents.Parents carrying genes may not manifest condition. Mutations may also affect gametes(sperm or ovum) or zygote (product of conception).,Ichthyosis is generally diagnosed by physical examination of the skin. Sometimes a family history is also very useful. A skin biopsy is also done at times to help to confirm the diagnosis.,"Doctor may prescribe moisturizers. Creams and ointments work better than lotions.These creams should be applied to moist skin immediately after bathing. One should use mild, non-drying soaps.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/intestines/inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine. The major types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis .
Ulcerative colitis is a type of an inflammatory bowel disease that causes long lasting inflammation in a part of digestive tract. Symptoms generally develop with the time. It generally involves the innermost lining of large intestine (colon) and rectum. It occurs only through continuous stretches of colon.
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation along the lining of the digestive tract, and generally spreads deep into affected tissues. This can cause abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea and even malnutrition. The inflammation due to Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people.
Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis are also considered inflammatory bowel diseases, but are usually regarded separately from classic inflammatory bowel disease.","The main symptoms of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are similar.
They include:

Abdominal pain – seen commonly in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis
Change in bowel habits- urgent or bloody diarrhoea or sometimes constipation
Weight loss
Extreme tiredness","The exact causes of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are not clear.
Genetic: IBD is a disease related to genetic causes and is also subjected to selective pressures, there is a strong relation between defense and autoimmunity, suggesting a key role for maintaining the genetic relationship between inflammation and infection.","Following tests and procedures are used to diagnosis:

Blood tests:Blood tests are generally done to know the presence of certain antibodies. Antibodies can sometimes help to diagnose type of inflammatory bowel disease, but these tests can't definitely make the diagnosis.
Colonoscopy:This procedure allows to view the inside of the entire colon using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with an attached camera. During the procedure, small samples of tissue (biopsy) are taken for laboratory analysis. Sometimes a tissue sample can help in confirming a diagnosis.
X-ray:A standard X-ray of abdominal area may be done to rule out toxic mega colon or a perforation of the colon, if these conditions are suspected because of severe symptoms.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy:In this procedure, doctor uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the last portion of colon (sigmoid colon).
Barium enema:This diagnostic test allows to evaluate the entire large intestine with an X-ray. Barium, a contrast solution, is placed into the bowel using an enema. Sometimes, air is added as well. The barium coats the bowel lining, creating a silhouette image of rectum, colon and a portion of the small intestine. This test is rarely and can be dangerous because the pressure required to inflate and coat the colon can lead to rupture of the colon.
Computerized tomography (CT) scan:A CT scan of the abdomen or pelvis may be performed if physician suspects a complication from ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A CT scan may also reveal how much of the colon is inflamed.
Stool sample:The presence of white blood cells in the stool indicates an inflammatory disease, possibly IBD. A stool sample is done to rule out other disorders, such as those caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):An MRI scanner uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues. Most MRI machines are large, tube-shaped magnets. During the test, the patient lies on a movable table inside the MRI machine. This test is very helpful in diagnosing and managing Crohn's disease. Its biggest advantage is that there is no radiation exposure. It’s particularly useful for evaluating a fistula around the anal area (pelvic MRI) or the small intestine (MRI enterography).
Capsule endoscopy:If there are symptoms that suggest Crohn's disease but other diagnostic tests are negative, the physician may perform capsule endoscopy. For this test patient needs to swallow a capsule that has a tiny camera in it. The camera takes pictures as it moves through the digestive tract, and the images are transmitted to a computer. The physician can see the images, which are then displayed on a monitor and checked for signs of Crohn's disease. Once it has made the trip through the digestive system, the camera exits the body painlessly in stool.
Double-balloon endoscopy:For this test, a longer scope is used where standard endoscopes don't reach. This technique is useful when capsule endoscopy shows abnormalities but the diagnosis is still not clear. It allows for biopsy of the abnormal area. It's usually performed in specialized endoscopy centers.

If one suspect IBD, he/ she should consult physician for further diagnosis and treatment.","One should eat well balanced and healthy food.
Medications:Anti-inflammatory drugs like Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) are used to control disease flares and were once acceptable can be used as a maintenance drug. They were used for several years in Crohn's disease.
Surgeries:Like

Bowel resection
Stricture plasty
Temporary or permanent colostomy or ileostomy.

If one suspect IBD, he/ she should consult physician for further diagnosis and treatment."
Insomnia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/insomnia,"Insomnia or sleeplessness, is a disorder characterized by an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep for a desired duration. Insomnia is generally seen as both a sign and a symptom that can accompany several sleep, medical, and psychiatric disorders characterized by a persistent difficulty falling asleep. Insomnia is typically followed by functional impairment while awake. Insomnia can occur at any age, but it is particularly common in the elderly.
Types of insomnia: Insomnia can be classified as acute, or chronic.
1.Acute insomnia: It is the inability to sleep well for a period of less than a month. Insomnia is present when there is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or when the sleep that is obtained is non-refreshing or of poor quality. These types of insomnia occurs despite there is adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and they must result in problems with daytime function. Acute insomnia is also known as short term insomnia or stress related insomnia.
2.Chronic insomnia: It lasts for more than a month. It can be caused by another disorder, or it can be a primary disorder. People with high levels of stress hormones or shifts in the levels of cytokines are more likely to have chronic insomnia. Its effects can vary according to its causes. They might include muscular fatigue, hallucinations, and/or mental fatigue. Those people that live with this disorder have hallucinations and tend to see things as if they are happening in slow motion. Chronic insomnia can cause double vision.","Waking up early in the morning and not being able to get back to sleep
Waking up several times in the middle of night
Lying awake for a long time at night
Feeling tired and not refreshed by sleep
Being irritable","Stressful events: If somebody experiences insomnia due to any stressful event. Like worrying about work, money or health, a loved one becoming ill or dying, and even noise and light are all causes of Stress and are likely to keep you awake at night.
Psychiatric problems: Underlying mental health problems can affect sleeping patterns.
They include:

Mood disorders, such as depression or bipolar disorder
Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder
Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia

Conditions: Insomnia can be caused by underlying:

Heart disease
Respiratory disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma
Neurological disease, such as alzheimer's or parkinson's disease
Hormonal problems, such as an overactive thyroid
Joint or muscle problems, such as arthritis
Sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy or sleep apnoea.
Drinking too much caffeine (contained in tea, coffee, energy drinks) can also affect sleeping patterns.

Medications: Some medicines that are available over the counter can cause insomnia.
These include:

Antidepressants
Epilepsy medicines
Medication for high blood pressure (hypertension), such as beta-blockers
Hormone replacement therapy
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Some medicines that are used to treat asthma, such as salbutamol, salmeterol and theophylline","Sleep history: Doctor may ask the patient about his sleep history.
Medical history:It is taken to enquire about his medical conditions, such as:

Any new or ongoing health problem
Painful injuries or health conditions, such as arthritis
Any medicines taken, either over-the-counter or prescription
Symptoms or a history of depression, anxiety, or psychosis
Coping with highly stressful life events, such as divorce or death

This information is only for understanding. If one has such symptoms, he/she should consult doctor for diagnosis and treatment.","Cognitive and behavioural treatments: Cognitive behavioural treatments (CBT) aim to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that may be contributing to insomnia. CBT is usually recommended if someone had sleep problems for more than four weeks.
It includes:

Stimulus-control therapy- which aims to help associate the bedroom with sleep and establish a consistent sleep/wake pattern
Sleep restriction therapy - The amount of time spent in bed to the actual amount of time spent asleep, creating mild sleep deprivation; sleep time is then increased as your sleeping improves
Relaxation training – This aims to reduce tension or minimize intrusive thoughts that may be interfering with sleep
Paradoxical intention –Try to stay awake and avoid any intention of falling asleep, it's only used if someone have trouble getting to sleep, but not maintaining sleep
Biofeedback – Sensors connected to a machine are placed on the body to measure responses, such as muscle tension and heart rate; the machine produces pictures or sounds to help control breathing and body responses.

Iron Deficiency Anemia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/iron-deficiency-anemia,"Iron is very important ingredient of human diet. This is essential for formation of haemoglobin  Low levels of Haemoglobin causes Iron deficiency anaemia. The red cells contain haemoglobin. The red cells are important particles in blood.
Haemoglobin in red cells carry oxygen all over the body. Iron-deficiency anemia (or iron-deficiency anemia) is a most common form of anemia (low red blood cell or hemoglobin levels).
Normal Hemoglobin Levels:Hemoglobin is measured in grams per deciliter of blood.

The normal levels are:

Women: 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dl
Men: 13.8 to 17.2 gm/dl
Children: 11 to 16 g/dl
Pregnant women: 11 to 15.1 g/dl.","The most common symptoms include:

Tiredness
Lethargy (lack of energy)
Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) Less common symptoms include:
Headache
An altered sense of taste
Pica - a desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay
A sore tongue
Feeling itchy
Hair loss
Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia)","It can be due to:

Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells (Haemolysis): Inherited conditions, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, stressors such as infections, drugs, snake or spider venom, or certain foods.
Blood loss: Blood contains iron within red blood cells. So if a person loses blood, he or she will lose some iron. Women with heavy periods are at high risk of iron deficiency anemia as blood is lost during menstruation. Slowly, chronic blood loss within the body such as from a peptic ulcer, a hiatus hernia, a colon polyp or colorectal cancer can also cause iron-deficiency anemia. It can also be due to conditions like hemorrhoids, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach),and cancer, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin or ibuprofen, which can cause ulcers and gastritis.
Lack of iron in the diet:The body regularly gets iron from the food we eat. If a person consumes too little iron, over time the body can become iron-deficient. Examples of iron-rich foods include meat, eggs, leafy green vegetables and iron-fortified foods. For proper growth and development, infants and children need iron from their diet.
An inability to absorb iron: Iron from food is absorbed into the bloodstream in the small intestine. An intestinal disorder such as celiac disease, which affects the intestine's ability to absorb nutrients from digested food, can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. If part of the small intestine has been bypassed or removed surgically, that may affect the ability to absorb iron and other nutrients.
Pregnancy: Without iron supplementation, iron deficiency anemia occurs in many pregnant women because iron stores need to serve their own increased blood volume as well as be a source of hemoglobin for the developing fetus.","To diagnosis Iron deficiency anemia blood test is performed to check the levels of:

Hemoglobin (a protein that transports oxygen) will be lower than normal
Fewer red blood cells (cells that contain hemoglobin) than normal
Red blood cells may be smaller and paler than usual
To check the levels of Vitamin B12 or folate as works with vitamin B12 to help your body produce red blood cells.

To diagnose the iron deficiency anemia one should consult doctor.","An iron supplement to restore iron deficiency in the body. The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate, taken orally (by mouth) two or three times a day. Iron-rich foods include:

Dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale
Iron-fortified cereals
Whole grains, such as brown rice
Beans
Nuts
Meat
Apricots
Prunes
Raisins

Infertility,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/reproductive-system/infertility,"Infertility is “a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse (WHO-ICMART glossary*). There are two kinds of infertility - primary and secondary:
Primary infertility means that the couple has never conceived. Secondary infertility means that the couple has experienced a pregnancy before and failed to conceive later. Globally, most infertile couples suffer from primary infertility.
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are the leading preventable cause of infertility by causing 70% of pelvic inflammatory diseases responsible for tubal damage. Low fertility is becoming more common worldwide, particularly in many urban settings where women are planning their first babies at older ages.
Infertility affects up to 15% of reproductive-aged couples worldwide. According to World Health Organization estimate the overall prevalence of primary infertility in India is between 3.9 to 16.8%. In Indian states prevalence of infertility varies from state to state such as 3.7 per cent in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra, to 5 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, and 15 per cent in Kashmir and prevalence varies in same region across tribes and caste.
The inability to have children affects couples and causes emotional and psychological distress in both men and women. Despite the various social, psychological, economic and physical implications, infertility prevention and care often remain neglected public health issues, or at least they rank low on the priority list, especially for low-income countries that are already under population pressure. But in recent years there is increased awareness to integrate infertility prevention, care and treatment into the basic health care services.","For a woman, infertility (or a state of subfertility) can manifest itself as either (WHO):

the inability to become pregnant
an inability to maintain a pregnancy
an inability to carry a pregnancy to a live birth.","Infertility can be caused by both men and women factors. About a third of infertility problems are due to female infertility and another third are due to male infertility. In remaining cases infertility may be due to problems in both partners or the cause is unclear.
Female infertility can be caused by a number of factors:
(a)Damage to fallopian tubes:Damage to the fallopian tubes (carry the eggs from the ovaries to the uterus) can prevent contact between the egg and sperm. Pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID) caused by various infections, endometriosis, pelvic surgery may lead to damage to fallopian tubes. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are the common cause of PIDs. 
(b)Disturb ovarian function/hormonal causes: Synchronized hormonal changes occur during the menstrual cycle leading to the release of an egg from the ovary (ovulation) and the thickening of the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) in preparation for the fertilized egg (embryo) to implant inside the uterus. Difficulty in ovulation is seen in following conditions-

Polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS)Polycystic ovary syndrome is the common cause of female infertility. PCOS interferes with normal ovulation.
Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Excessive physical (common in athletes) or emotional stress may result in amenorrhoea (absence of periods).
Diminished ovarian reserve or premature ovarian aging: women with diminished ovarian reserve may experience difficulty in conceiving, (though blood test will show elevated follicular stimulating hormones).
Premature ovarian insufficiency: Female ovaries stop working before she is 40 years of age. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.

(c)Uterine causes:Abnormal anatomy of the uterus; the presence of polyps and fibroids may lead to infertility.
(d)Cervical causes: A small group of women may have a cervical condition in which the sperm cannot pass through the cervical canal due to abnormal mucus production or a prior cervical surgical procedure.
Male factors causing infertility-
More than 90% of male infertility cases are due to low sperm counts, poor sperm quality, or both. The remaining cases of male infertility can be caused by number of factors including anatomical problems, hormonal imbalances, and genetic defects. Sperm abnormalities include:

Oligospermia (low sperm counts) /Azoospermia (no sperms): sperm count less than 20 million/ml is termed as oligospermia whereas azoospermia refers to the complete absence of sperm cells in the ejaculate.
Asthenospermia (Poor sperm motility): If 60% or more sperms have abnormal motility (movement is slow and not in straight line) it is termed as asthenospermia and may cause infertility.
Teratospermia (abnormal sperm morphology): about 60% of the sperms should be normal in size and shape for adequate fertility.

Different factors including congenital birth defects, diseases (such as mumps), chemical exposure, and life style habits can cause sperm abnormalities.
Factors that affect the fertility of both sexes include the following:

Environmental/occupational factors
Toxic effects related to tobacco, marijuana, or other drugs
Excessive exercise
Inadequate diet associated with extreme weight loss or gain
Advanced age","Both male and female factors can contribute to infertility. A detailed medical history, physical examination and investigations are needed to assess the cause of infertility.
Evaluation of infertility includes following steps:
(a) History taking: Couples with infertility problem are interviewed separately as well as together to know about important facts with full history taking. Full history includes: present history; menstrual and obstetric history (in female partner); contraceptive and sexual history; family and past history.
(b)Clinical examination: Full clinical examination of both partners is required for detection of any physical problem. It includes general examination along with examination of chest, breast, abdomen, and genitalia. It helps to health care professional to make a provisional diagnosis. Investigations are advised to prove the clinical diagnosis and to exclude other close possible causes.
(c) Investigations: Infertile couples are usually advised to start their investigations after 12 months of trying to conceive or after six months if the female partner is more than 35 years old or immediately if there is an obvious cause for their infertility or subfertility.
As the major causes of infertility are sperm abnormalities, ovulation dysfunction, and fallopian tube obstruction, the preliminary investigations for the infertile couple should be focused on:
Semen analysis: It should be done after 72 hours of sexual abstinence and two analysis should be advised with 3 months apart at the same lab.(Results may be interpreted for its volume, sperm count, motility, and morphology according to the WHO reference values*).
Female partner

Detection of ovarian function:
Hormonal assay (early follicular FSH and LH levels, and mid-luteal progesterone levels),
Transvaginal ultrasonography is used for detection of ovulation in females and any abnormality in uterus and adnexa (adjoining anatomical parts of the uterus).
Evaluation of tubal patency:

Hysterosalpingography (HSG): It is a radiological procedure. Thedye is injected in to the uterus through the cervix and simultaneously X-Ray pictures are taken to see the movement of dye in to the fallopian tubes. Spilling of dye into the abdominal cavity shows that tubes are patent.

Advanced investigations-

Hormonal assay: Thyroid function test, prolactin levels, testosterone, and other tests if polycystic ovary syndrome is suspected.
Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure used to visualize abdominal and pelvic organs (uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries).
Hysteroscopy is indicated for intrauterine space-occupying lesions detected on HSG
Chromosomal karyotyping is used for suspected genetic disorders.


Male partner-

Hormonal assay: FSH, LH, Testosterone, TSH and Prolactin (for male with abnormal seminal analysis and suspected endocrine disorder)
Testicular biopsy: A fine-needle aspiration biopsy to differentiate between obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia.
Chromosomal karyotyping is used for suspected genetic disorders.","Management of infertility ranges from counseling and advice to medications and surgery.
Counseling of both partners is an important aspect in the management of infertility with medical and psychological support to the couple.Counseling is provided for the healthy life style measures such as:

Healthy eating habits-
Adding more whole-grain products, fruits, vegetables.
Limiting processed foods and foods with added sugars, eating a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fats
Promote regular exercise
No smoking (avoid passive smoking)
Limit alcohol intake
Maintain healthy weight
Folic acid supplementation in women
Advice on rubella vaccination if seronegative
Treatment of Psycho-sexual problems

Specific treatment of disease that causes infertility- Whatever cause is detected during investigations relating to female or male partner, treatment is given accordingly. Management of STIs and PCOS can be viewed on www.nhp.gov.in.
When initial treatments don't work, couple may decide for assisted reproduction technology.
Assisted reproduction techniques (ART):

Intrauterine insemination (IUI): IUI is the placement of a man's sperm into a woman's uterus using a long, narrow tube. IUI may be used in the following conditions.
Defects of cervix
Low sperm counts
Sperm with low motility
Erection problems in male partner
Retrograde ejaculation (a condition in which sperms are deposited in to the bladder instead of going out through the urethra)
Women who have scarring or defects of the cervix.

IUI is of two types

artificial insemination by husband (AIH);
donor insemination (DI).
In vitro fertilization (IVF): In vitro fertilization, eggs and sperm are taken from the couple and are incubated together in a dish in a laboratory to produce an embryo. Medical specialist places the embryo into the woman's uterus, where it may implant and develop in a successful pregnancy.
Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT): in this procedure fertilization occurs naturally after eggs and sperm are placed inside the fallopian tube.
Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT): In ZIFT fertilized eggs are transferred to fallopian tube within 24 hours after fertilization. 
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): In this procedure single sperm is injected in to mature egg. It is used to treat sperm related infertility problems. 

Surrogate and gestational carriers-If a woman is unable to carry a pregnancy to term, the couple may choose a surrogate or gestational carrier.

A surrogate is a woman inseminated with sperm from the male partner of the couple. The resulting child will be biologically related to the surrogate and to the male partner. Surrogacy can be used when the female of the couple does not produce healthy eggs that can be fertilized.
A gestational carrier is implanted with an embryo that is not biologically related to her. This alternative can be used when a female partner produces healthy eggs but is unable to carry a pregnancy to term. Egg or sperm donation can be used in this situation."
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/intrauterine-growth-restriction-iugr,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy in developing countries, and carries an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity. IUGR refers to a condition in which foetus (an unborn baby) is smaller or less developed than normal for the baby's gender and gestational age. Gestational age is the age of a foetus or baby that starts on the first day of the mother's last menstrual period.
In IUGR foetal weight is below the 10th percentile for gestational age as estimated by an ultrasound. At term, the birth weight less than 2,500 g (5lb, or 8oz) is considered as IUGR. Small for gestational age or fetal growth restriction are the other terms used for IUGR. The term intrauterine growth restriction has largely replaced the term intrauterine growth retardation.
IUGR is classified into two types-

SymmetricorprimaryIUGR: In this condition all internal organs are reduced in size. It is found in 20%-30% of all cases of IUGR.
AsymmetricorsecondaryIUGR: In this condition the head and brain are normal in size, but the abdomen is smaller. It is evident mostly in the 3rdtrimester. It is more common and found in 70% to 80% of total IUGR cases.

Intrauterine growth restriction is observed in about 24% of newborns. In Asia IUGR accounts for nearly 75% of all affected infants. After prematurity IUGR is the second leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality.
Growth-restricted pregnancies are often complicated by a high rate of antepartum and intrapartum fetal distress and the need for cesarean delivery. These infants have many acute neonatal problems that include perinatal asphyxia, hypothermia (low body temperature), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and polycythemia (increased red blood cells), jaundice, feeding difficulties, feed intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
When IUGR infants grow up long-term complications include growth retardation, neurodevelopment defects may occur. These infants are more likely to develop adult onset diseases because of fetal epigenetic changes.
Timely diagnosis (by assessment of fetal growth at each prenatal visit) and management of IUGR are the major activities in reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality.","The main symptom of IUGR is a small for gestational age baby. During the antenatal checkup, a doctor measures the height of the uterus from the pubic bone to estimate the size of the fetus. After about the 20th week, uterine fundal height in centimeters is usually equal to the number of weeks of the pregnancy. A lag in fundal height of 4 cm or more with weeks of pregnancy suggests IUGR, and additional tests are required to confirm diagnosis. 
During ultrasound, the baby's estimated weight with IUGR is below the 10th percentile or less than that of 90% of babies of the same gestational age. At term, the birth weight less than 2,500 g (5 lb, 8 oz) is considered as IUGR. Not all babies that are born small have IUGR. In most severe cases IUGR can lead to stillbirth.
At term birth, symptoms of IUGR are:

Baby is small all over or malnourished.
Thin, pale, loose and dry skin
Umbilical cord is thin and often stained with meconium","IUGR has many causes related to mother, foetus and placenta (part that joins the mother and foetus). Various risk factors for IUGR can be summarized as-
A. Maternal causes –
Before pregnancy:

Low pre-pregnancy weight and small maternal size
Poor periconceptual nutritional status such as anemia, folate deficiency
Low socioeconomic status
Parity- none and more than 5 births
Recent pregnancy

During pregnancy:

Poor weight gain during pregnancy, especially in latter half
Moderate to heavy physical work
Chronic illness - such as malabsorption, diabetes, renal disease
Use of certain drugs, smoking, and alcohol
Pregnancy induced hypertension
Decreased oxygen availability such as in high altitude, severe maternal anemia

B. Uterine and placental factors:

Inadequate placental growth
Uterine malformations
Decreased utero-placental blood flow (such as in toxemias of pregnancy, diabetic vasculopathy)
Multiple gestations

C. Fetal causes include familial genetic and chromosomal abnormalities and intrauterine infections such as TORCH- which includes toxoplasmosis, other infections (syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19), rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpesinfections.
SymmetricorprimaryIUGR is due to genetic or chromosomal causes, early gestational intrauterine infections (TORCH) and maternal alcohol use.
Asymmetric IUGR is more commonly due to extrinsic influences that affect the foetus later in gestation, such as preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, and uterine anomalies.","One of the most important things when diagnosing IUGR is to know accurate gestational age of baby. Gestational age can be calculatedby using the first day of last menstrual period (LMP) and alsoby early ultrasound calculations. Once the gestational age is known the following methods can be used to diagnose IUGR.
Fundal height: It is the simplest and most common method to diagnose IUGR. Fundal height is size of uterus measured as the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus in centimeters. After the 20th week of pregnancy, the measure in centimeters usually corresponds with the number of weeks of pregnancy. A lag in fundal height of 4 cm or more suggests IUGR.
Weight checkups:Doctors routinely check and record the mother's weight at every prenatal checkup. If a mother is not gaining weight properly, it could indicate a growth problem in her baby.
Ultrasound: It is used to measure the baby's head and abdomen and compared with growth charts to estimate the baby's weight. Ultrasound can also be used to determine amniotic fluid.
Doppler assessment: It is a technique that uses sound waves to measure the amount and speed of blood flow through the blood vessels. Doctors may use this test to check the flow of blood in the umbilical cord and vessels in the baby's brain. Abnormal Doppler tests are diagnostic of IUGR.","General management measures: These include treatment of maternal disease, good nutrition and advice for bed rest.
Preterm delivery is indicated if the fetus shows evidence of abnormal function on biophysical profile testing. Antenatal administration of steroids in preterm pregnancies and delivery at an institution with an emergency obstetric care and neonatal care unit is advised.
The foetus should be monitored continuously during labor to minimize fetal hypoxia."
Japanese Encephalitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/japanese-encephalitis,"Japanese encephalitis(JE) is a viral disease that infects animals and humans. It is transmitted by mosquitoes in humans causing inflammation of the membranes around the brain.Japanese encephalitisis a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia generally spread from western pacific region in east to Pakistan in west and from Korea in north to Papua New Guinea in south.
Japanese encephalitis is a disease caused by a flavi virus that affects the membranes around the brain.

Jaundice,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/liver/jaundice,"Jaundice is a term used to describe the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. It's caused by a build-up of a substance called bilirubin in the blood and body's tissues. Any condition that disrupts the movement of bilirubin from the blood to the liver and out of the bodycan cause jaundice.Bilirubinis a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells (RBC) in the liver.There are several ways that a build- up of bilirubin can occur:

If red blood cells broke down too early, the spleen gets overloaded and hence too much bilirubin is produced to be handled by the liver. Unprocessed bilirubin accumulates in the bloodstream and eventually the skin and eyes looks yellow. This condition is called hemolytic anemia. At times this condition is inherited. Hemolytic anemia may also occur as a side-effect of certain drugs.
Sometimes the trouble is in the liver cells. If there is a faulty uptake, processing or excretion of bilirubin it will result in an accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream. Newborn babies can be temporarily jaundiced because of lack of mature enzymes needed to process bilirubin. In adults,alcoholismis a common cause of damage to liver cells. Other toxins and certain drugs can also cause acute damage to the liver.
A blockage in the bile duct can also result in a build-up of fully processed bilirubin. This can spill over into the urine and cause it to become very dark. The blockage is most commonly caused by a gallstone.","The main symptoms of jaundice are:

Yellow discoloration of the eyes and of the skin
Pale coloured stools (faeces)
Dark coloured urine","Jaundice is classified into three categories, depending on which part of the physiological mechanism the pathology affects. The three categories are:

Pre-hepatic jaundice:Pre hepatic jaundice is due to increased rate of haemolysis (breakdown of RBCs). Causes of haemolysis include:

Malaria
Sickle cell anemia
Thalassaemia
Gilbert syndrome

Hepatocellular jaundice:Hepato cellular jaundice can be due to any infection in the liver. It can be due to infection or exposure to a harmful substance, such as alcohol, disrupts the liver’s ability to process bilirubin.
Post hepatic jaundice:Post-hepatic jaundice, is also called as obstructive jaundice, is caused by an interruption to the drainage of bile in the biliary system. The most common cause is due to gallstone in the common bile duct or due to pancreatic cancer. Some underlying conditions that may cause jaundice are:

Acute inflammation of the liver- May impair the ability of the liver to conjugate and secrete bilirubin, resulting in a buildup of bilirubin.
Inflammation of the bile duct- May prevent the secretion of bile and removal of bilirubin, causing jaundice.
Obstruction of the bile duct- Prevents the liver from disposing of bilirubin, which results in hyperbilirubinemia.
Hemolytic anemia- Production of bilirubin increases when large quantities of erythrocytes are broken down.
Gilbert's syndrome- An inherited condition that impairs the ability of enzymes (biomolecules that provoke chemical reactions between substances) to process the excretion of bile.
Cholestasis- A condition in which the flow of bile from the liver is interrupted. The bile containing conjugated bilirubin remains in the liver instead of being excreted.","Urine test: It is used to measure levels of a substance called urobilinogen. Urobilinogen is produced when bacteria break down bilirubin inside the digestive system.
Blood tests: Blood tests include blood levels of enzymes found primarily from the liver, such as the aminotransferases (ALT, AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin (which causes the jaundice), and protein levels, specifically, total protein and albumin.
Other primary lab tests for liver function include gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and prothrombin time (PT).
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose consult physician.","There's no treatment for jaundice as such, but disease can be managed by managing symptoms and causes of jaundice.
Pre-hepatic jaundice
In treating pre-hepatic jaundice, the objective is to prevent the rapid breakdown of red blood cells that's causing the level of bilirubin to build up in the blood.
In cases of infections, such as malaria, the use of medication to treat the underlying infection is usually recommended. For genetic blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, blood transfusions may be required to replace the red blood cells.
Gilbert's syndrome doesn't usually require treatment because the jaundice associated with the condition isn't particularly serious and doesn't pose a serious threat to health.
Intra-hepatic jaundice
In cases of intra-hepatic jaundice, there's little that can be done to repair any liver damage, although the liver can often repair itself over time. Therefore, the aim of treatment is to prevent any further liver damage occurring.
For liver damage that's caused by infection, such as viral hepatitis or glandular fever, anti-viral medications may be used to help prevent further damage.
If the damage is due to exposure to harmful substances, such as alcohol or chemicals, avoiding any further exposure to the substance is recommended.
In severe cases of liver disease, a liver transplant is another possible option.

Post-Hepatic Jaundice
In most cases of post-hepatic jaundice, surgery is recommended to unblock the bile duct system.

During surgery, it might be required to remove:

The gallbladder
A section of the bile duct system
A section of the pancreas to prevent further blockages occurring

Kala-azar/ Leishmaniasis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/kala-azar-leishmaniasis,"Kala-Azar is a slow progressing indigenous disease caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania. In India Leishmania donovani is the only parasite that causes this disease. The parasite primarily infects the reticulo-endothelial system and may be found in abundance in bone marrow, spleen and liver.
Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL)
Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis is a condition in which Leishmania donovani parasites invades in skin cells. The parasite resides and develops there and manifests as dermal lesions.PKDL develops in some of the Indian Kala-Azar patients usually 1-2 years or more following recovery of Kala-Azar; less commonly without suffering from Kala-Azar. Recently it is believed that PKDL may appear without passing through visceral stage. However, adequate data is yet to be generated on course of PKDL manifestation.

Sand flies are small insects, about one fourth of the size of a mosquito. The length of a sand fly body ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 mm.
Sand flies breed inhigh relative humidity, warm temperature, high subsoil water and abundance of vegetation. Sandflies breed in favourable micro-climatic conditions in places with high organic matter that serve as food for larvae.
These are ecologically sensitive insects, fragile and cannot withstand desiccation.","Symptomatic:
A case of fever of more than two weeks duration not responding to anti-malarials and antibiotics. Clinical laboratory findings may include anemia, progressive leucopenia thrombocytopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia.
Laboratory:

Serology tests:A variety of tests are available for diagnosis of Kala-azar. The most commonly used tests based on relative sensitivity; specificity and operational feasibility include Direct Agglutination Test (DAT), rk39 dipstick and ELISA. However all these tests detect IgG antibodies that are relatively long lasting. Aldehyde Test is commonly used but it is a non-specific test. IgM detecting tests are under development and not available for field use.
Parasite demonstrationin bone marrow/spleen/lymph node aspiration or in culture medium is the confirmatory diagnosis. However, sensitivity varies with the organ selected for aspiration. Though spleen aspiration has the highest sensitivity and specificity (considered gold standard) but a skilled professional with appropriate precautions can perform it only at a good hospital facility.

This is just an indicative information. For diagnosis and treatment you should consult your doctor.","Diagnosis and treatment of Kala-Azar are problematic because of a variety of reasons. While treatment is lengthy and relatively costly, definitive diagnosis of Kala-Azar requires tissue specimens, which are conventionally obtained by organ needle aspiration for microscopic demonstration of amastigote forms in stained smears. Bone marrow the spleen, and lymph-node (in some regions) are the tissues most often sampled in patients with suspected infection. The diagnostic sensitivity of splenic aspiration is high (95% - 98%), but the procedure carries a risk of bleeding; the sensitivity of examination of bone marrow specimens is considered to be lower (53% - 95%). Organ aspiration and accurate examination of smears also require technical skills that are not uniformly available in rural areas. Culture or PCR testing of aspirate material improves parasitologic yield, but these methods are seldom undertaken outside of research laboratories.
Some of the drugs available for treatment of Kala-Azar in India:

Sodium Stibogluconate
Pentamidine Isethianate
Amphotericin B
Liposomal Amphotericin B

Kaposi’s Sarcoma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/kaposi-s-sarcoma,"Kaposi’s Sarcoma(KS)is a type of cancer that can affect both the skin and internal organs. It is generally caused by human herpes 8. The most common symptom of Kaposi’s Sarcoma is the appearance of red or purple patches on the skin. The patches then grow into lumps known as nodules. Kaposi’s Sarcoma is a systemic disease that can present with cutaneous lesions with or without internal involvement.
It has following subtypes:
1) Classic KS
2) African endemic KS
3) KS in iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients
4)Acquired immunodeficiency virus syndrome (AIDS)- related KS","They are typically found on the skin, but can also spread elsewhere, especially the mouth, gastro-intestinal tract and respiratory tract.
Skin:In skin they commonly affect areas that include the lower limbs, back, face, mouth, and genitalia. The lesions are usually plaque-like. Associated swelling may be from either local inflammation or lymphedema (local lymphatic vessels of the lesion). Skin lesions may be quite disfiguring and a cause of much psychosocial pathology.
Internal organs:The internal organs most commonly affected by Kaposi’s sarcoma are the lymph nodes, lungs and the digestive system. The symptoms of Kaposi’s sarcoma depend on which organs are affected. When the lymph nodes are affected, there may be swelling in the arms and legs which can be very painful and uncomfortable.","Kaposi’s sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), which is also known as the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV).The virus is transmitted during sex, through saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth. HHV-8 doesn't cause Kaposi’s sarcoma in everyone who gets infected with the virus.

Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (Dry eye syndrome),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/kerato-conjunctivitis-dry-eye-syndrome,"Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) or Dry eye syndrome is mainly caused due to aqueous tear deficiency.
As per Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) 2007, KCS is defined as ‘a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tears film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolality of tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface’.
Tear film has three components:-

Outer lipid layer: It is outer oily layer which retards evaporation of aqueous tears. It lubricates eyelids and prevents spillover of tears over lid margin.
Middle aqueous layer: It supply oxygen to cornea (transparent layer covering front of eye ) and make surface smooth by filling minute irregularities. It prevents bacterial infection and also washes away debris.
Inner mucin layer: It makes cornea wettable by aqueous in middle layer.

A defect in any component of tear film may lead to dry eye syndrome but primarily it is from aqueous tear deficiency.
Tears have smaller basic (resting) and larger reflex component. Reflex secretion occurs due to corneal sensory stimulation.
Effective spread and resurfacing, in addition to normal tear film, requires:-

Normal smooth corneal surface.
Normal rate of blinking.
Congruent ocular surface and eyelid.","Many patients do not have any symptoms. Some may have noticed deficient or reduced tears on peeling onions or even being emotional.
Common symptoms are:

Irritation of eyes
Burning sensations of eyes.
Foreign body sensation in eyes.
Mucoid discharge.
Transient blurring or fluctuation of vision.
Excessive tearing (due to reflex secretion in response of dry eye).
Hyperaemia (redness) of eyes.

Less common symptoms may include:

Tired feeling or heaviness of eyelids.
Photophobia.
Itching","A. Aqueous layer deficiency :- It can be :

Pure KCS : Lacrimal gland alone is affected by fibrosis.
Sjögren’s syndrome : It affects lacrimal glands, salivary glands and other mucous membranes. It is characterised by the presence of antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid arthritis and hypergammaglobulinaemia. It may be primary Sjögren’s syndrome when these changes occur in isolation or secondary Sjögren’s syndrome when associated with other diseases viz. Systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, juvenile chronic arthritis or primary biliary cirrhosis.
Lacrimal gland destruction by dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, sarcoidosis, tumour or pseudotumour.
Surgical removal of lacrimal gland.
Conjunctival scarring blocking excretory ducts of lacrimal gland or causing destruction of mucin secreting glands.
Congenital absence of lacrimal gland.
Hyposecretion of tears with increasing age.
Vitamin A deficiency.
Neurological lesions with sensory or motor reflex loss.

B. Dry eye due to evaporation of tears :- It can be :

Defect in lipid layer due to dysfunction of Meibomian glands (lipid secreting glands) or blepharitis ( inflammation of lid margins).
Defective/ reduced blinking e.g. Parkinson’s disease or extended periods of reading, computer work or driving.
Exposure keratopathy leading to dry cornea e. g. Bell’s palsy.
Dry eyes associated with contact lens wear.
Environmental factors like exposure to heating, air conditioning, increased velocity of air or reduced humidity.","Dry eye should be distinguished from other diseases affecting anterior surface of the eye e.g. conjunctivitis, infectious diseases, corneal abnormalities or keratopathies. Diagnosis depends upon clinical examination of eyes and conduct of certain specialised tests.
Tear film may show :
1. Increase in mucous strands due to accumulation of lipid contaminated mucin in the tear film. Mucous debris move with blinking.
2. Normally marginal tear meniscus is about 1mm high and convex. In dry eye, it is concave or absent altogether.
3. Froth in the tear film or along the lid margin.
Corneal examination may show :
1. Punctate lesions on cornea.
2. Mucous plaque formation. These are slightly elevated lesions on cornea.
3. Corneal filaments with one end attached to cornea and are very painful.
Tear film break-up time (BUT) :
This is the interval between last blink and the appearance of first dry spot.
Fluorescein dye is instilled in the eye and patient blinks to spread it and then stops blinking. Eye is examined under cobalt blue filter. After an interval, appearance of black spots or lines indicate formation of dry areas. Formation of dry area at same spot shows local corneal abnormality and is ignored. A BUT of less than 10 seconds suggests dry eye.
Rose Bengal test :
Rose Bengal dye stains mucus, dead and devitalised cells on cornea, being produced by dry eye. Use a small drop only since it causes ocular irritation, but local anaesthesia should not be instilled to avoid false positive results.
Lissamine green test :
Lissamine green dye stains both, healthy cells not covered by mucin as well as devitalised or dead cells. It does not cause irritation and stinging sensation like Rose Bengal dye but staining is more transient. 
Schirmer’s test :
This test measures wetting of special filter paper ( Whatmann No.41) ,which is 35 mm long and 5 mm wide, when placed at the junction of middle and outer third of the lower eye lid. Eye is dried gently and patient keep eyes open and blinks as necessary. It measures basic and reflex secretion(Schirmer’s test 1). But when this test is done under topical anaesthesia(Schirmer’s test 2), it measures basic secretion mainly, since it reduces reflex secretion but does not abolish it completely.
Wetting is measured after 5 minutes. Less than 10 mm of wetting without anaesthesia and less than 6 mm of wetting after anaesthesia is considered abnormal.
InflammaDrytest (Rapid Pathogen Screening Inc), 2013 :
InflammaDrytest is a recent, FDA approved, rapid in-office test taking less than 2 minutes. It measures inflammatory marker matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels in tears. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 level is elevated in the tears of patients with dry eye disease.
Impression cytology:
Impression cytology determines population of mucin secreting goblet cells. It helps to monitor progression of ocular surface changes leading to dry eye.
Quantitative measurement of tear components :
Measurement of tear film osmolarity or analysis of tear proteins aids in diagnosis of dry eye.
Other tests that may be used are :
a. Tear stability analysis system.
b. Tear ferning test.
c. Tear function index.
Sjögren syndrome as a cause of KCS may be excluded by appropriate immunological blood tests and biopsy of labial salivary glands.","Aim is to provide symptomatic relief to patient. A smooth corneal surface prevents its further damage and aggravation of symptoms.
Various modalities may be :

Avoiding high room temperature to decrease evaporation of existing tears.
Use of room humidifiers or moist chamber spectacles to reduce evaporation.
Contact lenses may be used to protect eyes. These may be of silicone rubber or gas permeable scleral bearing hard contact lenses with or without fenestration or highly gas permeable for overnight wear.
Lubricating supplements are the medications most commonly used. Artificial tears are used for mild to moderate KCS. These have short duration of action and therefore requires frequent instillation.
Artificial tears may be of following types :

Cellulose derivatives.
Mucomimetics.
Polyvinyl alcohol .

Other tear substitutes :

Povidone and sodium chloride.
Sodium hyaluronate to promote epithelial healing.

Mineral oil ointment may be used at night time before sleep.

Mucolytic drops e.g. acetylcysteine may be used for corneal filaments and mucous plaques.
Anti-inflammatory agents like topical corticosteroids, topical cyclosporine or topical or systemic omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acids inhibit the synthesis of lipid mediators) may be used.
Use of topical or systemic tetracycline.
Use of autologous or umbilical cord serum. Serum eye drops are used in cases of severe KCS with punctate epithelial defects and corneal damage to promote reepithelisation.
Use of systemic immunosuppressants.
Patients with lagophthalmos (incomplete lid closure) may be benefitted with small lateral tarsorrhahy (stitching together of upper and lower lid) to preserve tears.
Occlusion of punctum (punctum is a small hole in lids for drainage of tears from eyes to nose) is useful in severe KCS and also in those showing drug toxicity.
Occlusion of punctum may be :

Temporary: Punctum may be blocked with plug, silicone rods or even with 2/0 catgut suture. Plugs may be absorbable,nonabsorbable,hydrogel or thermoplastic. Initially, all four puncta are blocked. This is to assess whether blockage leads to tearing or not. Based on the results, permanent occlusion may be planned
Permanent: This is undertaken for severe KCS with Schirmer’s test value consistently being 2mm or less. It is done with gentle heating of proximal canaliculus ( small passage connecting punctum to the lacrimal sac) with cautery at black heat or by Argon laser. Permanent occlusion should be avoided in young patients due to fluctuating tear amount.


Conjunctival flap may be pulled over to prevent dryness and its complications.
Mucous membrane grafting.
Amniotic membrane transplantation may be done.
Salivary gland duct transposition for lubrication.
Descemetocele (thin and bulging cornea), impending or frank perforation may be covered with tissue adhesive cyanoacrylate, corneal or corneoscleral patch."
Kyasanur forest disease,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/kyasanur-forest-disease,"Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever endemic (constant presence of disease) in Karnataka State, India. It is also referred as monkey fever by local people. The virus causing the disease: KFD virus (KFDV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae.
KFDV was first identified in 1957, when an illness occurred in monkeys (the black faced langur and the red faced bonnet monkey) in Kyasanur Forest area of Shimoga district, Karnataka State along with febrile illness and few deaths in humans in neighborhood area (Sagar taluk of Shimoga district).
Initially the disease was limited to three taluks (Sagar, Shikaripur and Sorab) of the Shimoga district of Karnataka. In subsequent years disease spread to Uttar Kannada, Udupi, Mangalore (Dakshina Kannada) and Chikmagalure districts of Karnataka.
During 2012-2013, disease was reported from new districts and new states in India: Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka State; Waynad and Malappuram districts, Kerala State and Nilgiri district, Tamilnadu State.
In 2013, an outbreak of KFD occurred in Bandipur Tiger Reserve Forest, Karnataka. In 2014, Thirthahalli taluk of Shimoga district, Karnataka reported an outbreak. Outbreaks occurred in Pali village of Sattari taluka, and three villages (Mauxi, Zarme and Kopardem) under Community Health Centre (CHC) Valpoi, Northeast Goa in 2015.
Evidences of KFD virus or related viruses were found in different parts of India (parts of the Saurashtra region in Gujarat State, forested regions west of Kolkata, West Bengal State, and the Andaman Islands) during serological studies.
The increase in number of new foci and cases indicates that ecobiological changes due to deforestation and use of new land for farming and cattle grazing could lead to spread of KFD virus to newer geographical areas.
Viruses related to KFDV have been identified in China and Saudi Arabia.","The incubation period of KFD is about 2 to 7 days after tick bites or exposure.


The onset of symptoms is sudden, with chills, frontal headache, severe myalgia followed by fever. The increase in temperature is continuous and lasts for 5-12 days or even longer.


Muscle pains occur at the nape of the neck, lumbar region and calf muscles. Gastrointestinal symptoms as diarrhoea and vomiting may occur at third to fourth day of illness. Patient may feel photophobia (discomfort in the eyes due to light exposure).


In the majority of cases there are no haemorrhagic manifestations but in few cases bleeding from the nose, gums, gastrointestinal haemorrhage (blood in vomit or fresh blood in the stools) and cough with blood tinged sputum/haemoptasis(coughing up blood) may occur.


Physical examination reveals enlargement of cervical lymph nodes and papulovesicular lesions on the soft palate.


Most of the patients recover without any complications after one to two weeks of symptoms.In few patients the disease runs a biphasic course; the second phase starts in the third week of illness after a febrile period of one to two weeks. It is characterized by return of fever and neurological symptoms as headache, neck stiffness, mental disturbance, coarse tremors, giddiness, and abnormality of reflexes.

Case fatality rate is 2% to 10% (% of KFD cases die due to the disease).","KFD is caused by a virus of flavivirus group called KFDV. It is antigenically related to other tick-borne flaviviruses and resembling Russian spring–summer (RSS) complex of viruses.
Mode of transmission of KFD virus:
The virus is transmitted to humans by bite of infected unfed nymphs*(immature stage of tick). Human to human transmission is not known.
Natural hosts and reservoirs- Small mammals particularly rats and squirrels are main reservoir of the virus. Monkeys act as amplifying hosts for the virus and disseminate the infection, but most of them die from KFD infection. Cattle maintain tick population by providing them blood meal but play no part in virus maintenance. Man is incidental or dead end host, and plays no role in viral transmission.
Vectors- Hard Ticks of genus Haemaphysalis transmit the disease. Spinigera species of Haemaphysalis is the main vector of KFD and is commonly found in Karnataka State, India. Humans become infected through the bite of infected unfed nymphs when they pass through the forests. Adult ticks feed on large animals like cattle. These large animals are good hosts for proliferation of ticks but are not significant for virus dissemination due to insignificant viremia (presence of virus in blood) in them. Ticks also transmit this virus transstadially (from one life stage to next) thus also acts as reservoir for the virus.
(*Life cycle of hard ticks- Hard ticks have four developmental forms; egg, larva, nymph and adult (female and male). Adult fed female tick lays eggs on the ground, which hatch to larvae under the vegetations. The larvae further infest and feed on small mammals and monkeys, drop on the ground and change into nymphs. Nymphs feed on small mammals, birds, (as well as accidentally infesting humans), drop on the ground and mature in to adults. Adult ticks usually feed and mate on large animals such as cattle, monkeys. Such type of ticks, feeding on three different hosts is called three-host ticks, one each for the larval, nymphal, and adult life stages).
Risk factors-

People with occupational or recreational exposure to rural or outdoor settings (e.g., hunters, herders, forest workers, farmers) are potentially at risk for infection by contact with infected ticks.
In Karnataka more cases are reported during the dry season, from November to June. This could be correlated with the increased activity of nymphs during November to May in this area.","The disease should be differentiated from other diseases such as influenza, typhoid, dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, rickettsial group of fevers. The following tests should be performed on blood samples:

Complete blood count (CBC), total leukocytic count (TLC)/ differential leukocytic count (DLC), haemoglobin level, and platelet counts;

Liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase);

Serum electrolytes, blood urea, serum creatinine;

Smear for malaria parasite or malaria rapid diagnostic test;

Tests to rule out other diseases with similar symptoms.

Diagnosis of KFDV-

Real-time RT-PCR, RT-PCR can be performed from blood/serum of humans, blood and viscera of infected monkeys, or tissues of ticks. Real-time RT-PCR, can detect the virus in human samples after onset of febrile illness up to the 10th day of illness.

KFDV can be isolated from the blood of patients (in acute phase, two to five days of symptoms onset), positive tick pools, or the blood or viscera of monkeys by inoculation into animal or culture.

KFD anti-IgM antibodies can be detected using ELISA during the acute phase (4 days onward) of illness.

KFD anti-IgG antibodies (ELISA) can be used for sero-surveillance of human population to understand their exposure with KFDV in other areas.","There is no specific treatment for KFD.
Management of disease is mainly supportive in the form of maintenance of the hydration and measures to prevent and control bleeding disorders and neurological complications."
Keratoconus,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/keratoconus,"Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory, bilateral (but usually asymmetrical) disease of the cornea which results in progressive corneal steepening. It is characterised by para-central corneal thinning and ectasia so that the cornea takes the shape of a cone. Visual loss occurs primarily from myopia and irregular astigmatism and secondarily from corneal scarring.
Duddell in 1729, described a patient with protruding conical corneas and associated poor vision. Keratoconus was initially broadly defined based on the shape and location of the cone. These included round or nipple cones with a central conical protrusion, and oval cones, often with inferior sagging.
Marc Amsler was the first one to describe early corneal topographic changes in keratoconus patients using keratoscope/ placido disc (ophthalmic instrument for detecting abnormal curvature of the cornea). He categorised keratoconus into clinically recognisable stages as:

Latent stage: Latent stage was recognisable by placido disc only.
Early stage: Early stages were subdivided into two categories as:


- Keratoconus fruste, which entailed 1- to 4-degree deviation of horizontal axis of the placido disc.
- Early or mild keratoconus, which entailed 5- to 8-degree deviation of horizontal axis.
The prevalence of keratoconus in general population appears to be relatively high and is likely to be higher when examined with corneal topography (also called photokeratoscopy or videokeratography). Corneal topography is a computer assisted diagnostic tool that creates a three- dimensional map of the surface of the cornea. Keratoconus occurs in all ethnic groups with no male or female preponderance. It is commonly an isolated ocular condition, but sometimes coexists with other ocular and systemic diseases.
Commonly recognised ocular associations include vernal keratoconjunctivitis, retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis; many of the connective tissue disorders (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndromes), mitral valve prolapse, atopic dermatitis and Down syndrome.
Particular risk factors include atopic history, especially ocular allergies, rigid contact lens wear and vigorous eye rubbing. Most keratoconus cases appear spontaneously, but few may show evidence of genetic transmission.
Keratoconus generally manifests at puberty, and is progressive until third to fourth decade of life when it usually arrests. Sometimes, however, it may commence later in life and progress or arrest at any age.","Symptoms are highly variable and depend upon the stage of the disease. Early in the disease, there may be no symptoms. In advanced disease, there is significant diminution and distortion of vision.

Monocular polyopia (perception of multiple ‘ghost’ images in the eye).
Blurring of vision.
Decreased visual acuity.
Progressively poor vision, not corrected with eye glasses.
Impaired visual perception.
Decreased contrast sensitivity.
Streaking and flaring distortion around light sources.
Marked anisometropia (difference in vision of two eyes).
Glare.
Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light).
Eyestrain, in order to read clearly.
Poor vision at night.
Itching.

Monocular polyopia (perception of multiple ‘ghost’ images in the eye), decreased visual acuity, and decreased contrast sensitivity may be seen in other disorders, especially early nuclear sclerotic cataract.","The cause of keratoconus is not known. It may not be a single disorder, but rather a phenotypic expression of perhaps many causes, both genetic and environmental.
The inheritance pattern of keratoconus is incompletely defined. In the past it was believed that more than 90% of cases were sporadic. With the advent of videokeratography to assess family members, however, pedigrees have been analysed. These studies show corneal changes consistent with keratoconus in some family members, which suggest an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.
Keratoconus may be associated with wide variety of systemic and ocular conditions.
Systemic associations:

Atopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction): One of the most common associations of keratoconus is atopy and is seen in condition like vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Eye rubbing seen in systemic atopy may play a role in the development of keratoconus.
Down syndrome (Trisomy 21): In Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), frequency of acute hydrops is higher, perhaps because of eye rubbing and/or these patients are treated infrequently with keratoplasty and their disease is allowed to progress further.
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
Marfan syndrome.
Crouzon syndrome. 
Apert syndrome.

Ocular associations: 

Leber’s congenital amaurosis.
Retinitis pigmentosa.
Retinopathy of prematurity.
Fuchs’ corneal endothelial dystrophy.
Posterior polymorphous dystrophy.

Given the relatively high prevalence of keratoconus in general population, some of the associations may be coincidental.

Studies suggest various contributory factors such as:

Enzyme abnormalities in corneal epithelium: Enzyme abnormalities such as increased expression of lysosomal enzymes (catalase and cathepsin) and decreased levels of inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes (tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinases), may play a role in corneal stromal degradation.
Differentially expressed corneal epithelium: Differentially expressed corneal epithelium between keratoconus and myopes (as controls) in both genetic expression and protein expression.
Molecular defect: Molecular defect producing unusual absence of water channel protein aquaporin 5 in keratoconus as compared to normal corneal epithelium.
Gelatinolytic activity: Gelatinolytic activity in stroma has been described, which may be due to decreased function of enzyme inhibitors.
Abnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking: Abnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking may be the cause of keratoconus.
Eye rubbing: Cytokine has been suggested as a mediator of eye rubbing and stromal degradation. Keratoconus in patients with atopic dermatitis, Down syndrome, and Leber congenital amaurosis, a congenital photoreceptor degeneration, could be related to forceful eye rubbing or the oculodigital reflex. The latter is a behavioural pattern seen in visually and mentally handicapped children who repeatedly strike their eyes with hands.
Hard contact lens wear.



Pathophysiology:
All layers of the cornea are believed to be affected by keratoconus, although the most notable features are the thinning of the corneal stroma, the fragmentation of the Bowman layer and the deposition of iron in the basal epithelial cells, forming the Fleischer ring. Folds and breaks in the Descemet’s membrane result in acute hydrops and striae, which produces variable amount of diffuse scarring.","Refraction, keratometry, corneal topography and slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) examination helps in reaching to the diagnosis of keratoconus.
Refraction: Patients with keratoconus often report blurring/impairment of vision due to progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism. There may be multiple unsatisfactory attempts in obtaining optimum correction with glasses. Spectacles and soft contact lenses may initially give satisfactory vision, but vision tends to decline over time and requires rigid gas-permeable contact lenses for correction.
Keratometry: Images of keratometry mires commonly will be steep, highly astigmatic, irregular, and often appear egg-shaped rather than circular or oval in keratoconus. A value of 47.2 Diopters (D) or greater is suggestive of keratoconus. These signs may be absent in some patients of keratoconus.
Corneal topography/Computerised videokeratography: is helpful in reaching a diagnosis, especially when the typical bio-microscopy signs of Vogt striae and Fleischer ring are absent. Several quantitative indices are available using corneal topography information to screen for keratoconus.
Ultrasonic pachymetry: Ultrasonic pachymetry may be useful to confirm corneal thinning in patients with suspected keratoconus on slit- lamp examination or videokeratography. Orbscan corneal topography system and Oculus Pentacam which provides both topography and pachymetry maps are particularly useful in making a diagnosis.
Keratoconus is differentiated according to severity of disease as well as shape of cornea.
Shape- based differentiation:
Conical shapes of cornea are differentiated as:

Nipple cones: Nipple cones have a diameter of 5mm or less and are located in the center or slightly below the center of the cornea.
Oval cones: Oval cones are larger in diameter and are inferonasally or inferotemporally to the center of the cornea.
Globus cones: Globus cones are large and involve about 75% of the surface of cornea and are least common.

Severity- based differentiation:
I. Mild keratoconus:
External and corneal signs are often absent or are minimal.

Spectacle correction: A history of multiple inadequate spectacle corrections of one or both eyes and it may show oblique astigmatism as well as moderate-to-high myopia on refraction.
Keratometry values: Irregularly astigmatic keratometry values, not necessarily on the steep side of normal (approximately 45 Diopters), are consistent with diagnosis.
Computer-assisted videokeratography: Computer-assisted videokeratography may reveal,

- Inferior corneal steepening (approximately 80% of keratoconus patients),
- Central corneal astigmatic steepening (approximately 15% of keratoconus patients),
- Even bilateral temporal steepening (extremely rare).

Optical coherence tomography pachymetry (OCT pachymetry): Optical coherence tomography pachymetry shows paraxial corneal thinning.
Diagnostic rigid contact lens: On application of diagnostic rigid contact lens with its base curve equal to the flat keratometry reading after instilling fluorescein sodium dye, a typical nipple pattern is seen in the underlying tear film.
Corneal sensitivity: Corneal sensitivity is reduced.
Tear secretions: Tear secretions are decreased.

II. Moderate keratoconus:

Retinoscopy: On retinoscopy, there may be distortion of reflex which shows ‘scissoring reflex’.
Charleaux’s sign: Charleaux oil droplet reflex is a bright reflex from the conical apex surrounded by a dark circular shadow produced by corneal ectasia. Charleaux’s sign or oil drop sign is visualised on observation of the cornea with the pupil dilated using a direct ophthalmoscope set on plano.
Munson sign: Munson sign is the ‘V’ shape protrusion produced in the lower lid by cornea on down gaze.
Rizutti’s sign: Rizutti’s sign is an arrowhead pattern at the nasal limbus being produced by focusing of a light beam shown from temporally across the cornea.
Prominent corneal nerves: There may be enhanced appearance of corneal nerves.
Vogt striae (fine stress lines): Patients may show Vogt striae (fine stress lines) in the deep stroma. These deep stromal stress lines clear when pressure is applied to the globe.
Fleischer ring: Deposition of iron in the basal epithelial cells in a ring shape (often partial) at the base of the conical protrusion, called the Fleischer ring.
Corneal scarring: Corneal scarring may be present at various levels.

- Superficial corneal scarring, which may be fibular, nebular or nodular.
- Deep stromal scarring perhaps represents resolved mini-hydrops.
- Some patients show scarring at the level of the Descemet membrane, consistent in appearance with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy. This may be a variant of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy.

Keratometry values: Keratometry values are 45- 52 Diopters. There may be pulsation of the reflected images on standard keratometry because thinned cornea readily transmits the ocular pulse.

Similar pulsations of the mires on applanation tonometry may be noted.

Optical coherence tomography pachymetry: Optical coherence tomography pachymetry shows paraxial (usually inferior to the pupil) stromal thinning.

III. Advanced keratoconus:

Enhancement of all corneal sign, symptoms, and visual loss/ distortion, including Vogt striae, Fleischer ring, and/or scarring, is present.
Acute corneal hydrops: Acute corneal hydrops results in acute overhydration of the cornea and accumulation of fluid within the corneal stroma due to acute rupture of Descemet’s membrane. The overlying corneal epithelium may become oedematous, and fluid may leak through the corneal epithelium. The ruptured Descemet’s membrane curls in on itself, and over time endothelial cells spread over the posterior stromal defect.
Keratometry: Keratometry values are greater than 52 Diopters.


Grading keratoconus:
Several quantitative indices are available using corneal topography information to screen for keratoconic corneal shape factors. The two most commonly known indices are those of Rabinowitz and Maeda and Klyce.
I. Rabinowitz index: Rabinowitz created KISA% index, which provides an algorithm to quantify results from computerised videokeratoscopy. The KISA% index uses:

The corneal central keratometry (K value) value, which indicates central corneal steepening.
The inferior- superior dioptric asymmetry (I- S) value
The keratometric astigmatism (AST) index, which quantifies the degree of regular corneal astigmatism based on (SimK1- SimK2). Simulated keratometry (SimK) index provides information on the diopteric power of the flattest and most curved meridians. Numerically, it is expressed as K1 and K2, and the difference (SimK1- SimK2) between the two values provides a quantitative value of corneal astigmatism.
The skewed radial axis (SRAX) value: Skew of steepest radial axis measures the angle between the more curved superior semi- meridian and the more curved inferior semi- meridian.


Rabinowitz diagnostic criteria consist of three corneal topography derived indices, which, when abnormal in value, should alert the clinician to consider a diagnosis of keratoconus. These indices are:


K value (Central keratometry) quantifies the central steepening of the cornea that occurs in keratoconus. A value of 47.20 D or greater is suggestive of keratoconus.
I-S value (inferior- superior value) quantifies the inferior versus superior corneal diopteric asymmetry that occurs in keratoconus. A positive value indicates higher inferior curvature while a negative value indicates higher superior curvature. I-S values between 1.4D and 1.8D are defined as cut- off points for suspected keratoconus. I-S values higher than 1.8D are defined as cut- off points for clinical keratoconus.
KISA% incorporates the K, I-S values, SRAX and AST with a measure quantifying regular and irregular astigmatism into one index. This index is highly sensitive and specific in separating normal from keratoconic corneas. A value of greater than 100% is highly suggestive of keratoconus, and the range from 60 to 100% represents suspected keratoconus.

II. Maeda and Klyce computer expert program: Maeda and Klyce designed a computer expert program, based on linear discriminant analysis of 8 indices drawn from the corneal map and a binary decision tree. The program assigns the topographical map a quantitative percentage score of the severity of keratoconus called the keratoconus index% (KCI%). A value of greater than zero is believed to be suggestive of keratoconus.
III. McMahon and colleague keratoconus severity score (KSS): McMahon and colleagues and the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK) study, have proposed a method called the keratoconus severity score (KSS) for grading the severity of keratoconus. The KSS score utilises:

Clinical signs (Vogt’s striae, Fleischer ring, corneal scarring).
Two corneal topography indices (average corneal power and the root mean square (RMS) error for higher- order aberrations).
Manual interpretation of the topography map to form a 1-to-5 grading system.

Advantages of KSS score:

KSS system provides good reproducibility.
It is not limited to the use of one topographer.
Unlike KISA% index, it grades the severity of keratoconus rather than just identifying presence or absence of the condition.


Histopathology:
All layers of the cornea are affected by keratoconus. Keratoconus shows irregular epithelium, breaks in Bowman’s layer, and fibrosis filling in the breaks that extend beneath the epithelium. Iron deposition in the basal corneal epithelial cells forms the characteristic Fleischer ring. With hydrops, breaks at the layer of Descemet’s membrane are seen, with inward curling of Descemet’s membrane, which is otherwise normal. Some studies have reported endothelial cell loss in association with the rupture of the Descemet’s membrane.

Electron microscopy shows decreased thickness of the cornea with fewer lamellae. The collagen fibrils in the lamellae are thickened mildly and the space between fibrils is increased.


Differential diagnosis:
Keratoconus should be distinguished from other ectatic and thinning disorders such as:

Pellucid marginal degeneration.
Terrien’s marginal degeneration.
Keratoglobus.
Post-traumatic corneal ectasia.
Protrusion of cornea subsequent to corneal thinning from ulceration.


The distinction can usually be made by slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) examination and corneal topography.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical therapy:

Spectacle correction: Initially, attempt should be made to correct myopic astigmatism by prescribing spectacle correction. Early keratoconus patients may get satisfactory vision with spectacles. Development of irregular astigmatism often limits the use of spectacle correction, and patients may require contact lenses.
Rigid gas- permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas- permeable (RGP) contact lenses are often the first lenses of choice and may be prescribed once spectacle-corrected acuity becomes inadequate. Other lenses used are piggyback lenses, pure hydro gel lenses, multi curve or aspheric contact lenses. Contact lens wear often is complicated by episodes of intolerance, allergic reactions (e.g. giant papillary conjunctivitis), corneal abrasions, neovascularisation, sometimes leading to total intolerance. Though contact lenses are extremely useful, it may increase the risk of corneal scarring.



Surgical therapy: 
Surgical therapy may be resorted to when patient does not improve with the use of contact lenses.
Contact lenses may fail due to:

Inadequate acuity.
Inadequate lens tolerance.
Frequent lens displacements.
Peripheral thinning.

Surgical procedures:

Keratoplasty: Standard surgical treatment consists of keratoplasty. Recurrence of keratoconus after keratoplasty is rare. Recurrence may be due to:

- Incomplete excision of the cone at the time of surgery.
- Unrecognised keratoconus in the corneal donor.
- Host cellular activity that causes changes in the donor corneal material.
Lamellar keratoplasty: Lamellar keratoplasty is effective, but this is not preferred because of the technical difficulties in the procedure and slightly reduced visual outcome.
Epikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty has been successful as well, but it has been abandoned due to suboptimal visual outcome.
Penetrating keratoplasty: By far the most frequent procedure is penetrating keratoplasty. At the time of keratoplasty, decreasing the donor/ recipient size disparity reduces post-keratoplasty myopia. Complications of penetrating keratoplasty include corneal graft rejection, glaucoma, cataract formation, anisometropia, astigmatism and infection.
Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) has been proposed as an alternative to penetrating keratoplasty. Recent advances in surgical technique have generated interest in DALK. Primary advantages are:
- Increased structural integrity.
- Reduced risk of graft rejection.
While challenging to perform, innovative techniques such as the big-bubble technique have reduced surgical operating time, improved the safety of the procedure, and gives visual outcome similar to penetrating keratoplasty. Complications of DALK include graft- host interface haze, Descemet’s membrane perforation and stromal rejection.

Intra-corneal ring segments: Intra-corneal ring segments have achieved some success in patients without corneal scarring in reducing the myopia and astigmatism and improving spectacle- corrected visual acuity. INTACS (Addition Technology, Fermont, CA) are intrastromal corneal ring segments, placed in the peripheral cornea, either mechanically or with the femtosecond laser.
Combined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking: Combined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking consists of photo-polymerisation of corneal stroma by combining vitamin B2 (photosensitising substance) with UVA. This process increases rigidity of corneal collagen and thus reduces the likelihood of further ectasia.


Prognosis:
Keratoconus, though progressive initially, stabilises after some time in most of the patient. Most patients with keratoconus do well with rigid contact lenses.
Keratoplasty may be required when patients do not improve with contact lenses.
Fortunately, patients with keratoconus never become totally blind."
Keratoglobus,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/keratoglobus,"Keratoglobus is a rare non-inflammatory corneal thinning disorder characterised by generalised thinning and globular ectasis (protrusion) of the cornea. The non-inflammatory corneal ectasias are a group of disorders characterised by corneal thinning, protrusion, and scarring. Keratoglobus forms a rarer subset of this group. 
Keratoglobus was first described as a separate clinical entity by Verrey in 1947, through detailed descriptions of his patients. In the past, it was considered synonymous with megalocornea and congenital glaucoma.
The exact genetics and pathogenesis of this disorder is still not clear. There are similarities with other non-inflammatory thinning disorder like keratoconus, which gave rise to hypothesis about the aetiopathogenesis.
Keratoglobus and keratoconus are both non-inflammatory ectatic disorders of the cornea. Cavara in 1950 made distinction between keratoglobus and keratoconus. The cornea in keratoglobus is diffusely thinned, often more markedly in the peripheral cornea, whereas in keratoconus the thinning is most prominent in the central cornea. The histopathological changes seen in keratoglobus, including disruption of Bowman's layer and Descemet's membrane breaks, are very similar to those seen in advanced keratoconus. These similarities have brought about confusion as to whether the disorders comprising this group are separate clinical disorders, or rather a spectrum of the same disease process. In fact, the histological similarities have led to the speculation that keratoglobus may be an end-stage manifestation of advanced keratoconus.
Clinical presentation is characterised by progressive diminution of vision resulting from irregular corneal topography with increased corneal fragility due to extreme thinning. Conservative and surgical management for visual rehabilitation and improved tectonic (structural) stability have been described, but are challenging. In the absence of a definitive standard procedure for management of this disorder, various surgical procedures have been attempted in order to overcome the difficulties.
Both congenital and acquired forms have been shown to occur, and may be associated with various other ocular and systemic syndromes including the connective tissue disorders.
Congenital form is present at birth and is associated with:

Ehlers- Danlos syndrome type VI.
Blue sclera syndrome.
Leber’s congenital amaurosis.

Acquired form presents in adulthood and may evolve from pre-existing cases of keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration. It is associated with:

Chronic marginal blepharitis.
Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy.
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis.","Patients are generally asymptomatic.
Symptoms include:

Poor vision.
Suboptimal visual acuity with spectacle correction.
Poor fit, associated pain or suboptimal visual acuity with use of contact lenses.

Patient developing acute hydrops may present with:

Pain.
Watering.
Photophobia.
Sudden diminution of vision.

Due to extreme thinning and fragility of cornea, patients may present with:

Corneal perforation.","Causes of Keratoglobus may be:

Congenital: Keratoglobus is primarily considered a congenital disorder present since birth. The congenital form of the disorder is always bilateral. The exact genetics of the disorder have not been studied in detail and no definite inheritance pattern has been described. It is assumed to be autosomal recessive.

      It has also been associated with:

- Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type VI: Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type VI is distinct for its ocular manifestations. These include corneal abnormalities of cornea plana, keratoconus and keratoglobus, blue sclera, and ocular fragility. Other systemic features in this type are the presence of hypermobile joints, skeletal abnormalities like scoliosis, pectus excavatum, a marfanoid habitus, and hearing loss. Skin laxity and fragility is not a characteristic finding, unlike in other types of Ehlers–Danlos syndromes, and lysyl hydroxylase activity may be normal.
- Marfan syndrome.
- Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome.
- Blue sclera syndromes: Blue sclera syndromes may be the manifestation of syndromes like Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type VI or osteogenesis imperfecta.
- Leber’s congenital amaurosis.


Acquired: In recent years, there have been reports of acquired forms of keratoglobus. It has been associated with disorders such as:

- Vernal keratoconjunctivitis.
- Chronic marginal blepharitis.
- Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy.
- Idiopathic orbital inflammation.
Case reports of keratoglobus being associated with syphilis, trauma and posterior polymorphous dystrophy have also been reported in the literature.
There are reports of keratoconus and keratoglobus, as well as pellucid marginal corneal degeneration and keratoglobus being clinically documented in the same patient over time. Overlaps in aetiological factors between keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, and keratoglobus, such as their manifestations in connective tissue disorders and various acquired forms leads to speculation about their being different spectrums of the same disease. However, a constant association and progression between these ectatic disorders has not been described to validate the hypothesis.","The diagnosis of keratoglobus is essentially clinical, owing to the characteristic clinical findings. In less severe cases, there may be difficulty in differentiating the condition from other ectatic conditions.
Keratoglobus, a bilateral ectatic disorder of the cornea, is characterised by a globular protrusion of the cornea associated with diffuse thinning from limbus to limbus. The age of onset is at birth.
Patients usually present with stable or worsening bilateral visual impairment which may not be corrected with spectacles or contact lenses. Rarely, patient may present with acute pain in eyes due to acute hydrops.
Clinical diagnosis is made by slit lamp examination (bio-microscopy) of the eye.
Clinical features:

Irregular retinoscopic reflex.
Myopia or high myopia.
Irregular astigmatism.
Globular protrusion of cornea.
Diffuse corneal thinning, most severe in peripheral part and may be up to one- fifth of the normal corneal thickness.
Folds, breaks, or thickening of Descemet’s membrane.
Spontaneous rupture or tear of Descemet’s membrane.
Clear cornea unless there are episodes of acute hydrops and scarring.
Normal corneal diameter, which distinguishes it from buphthalmos.
Vogt striae and Fleischer’s rings are not associated, unlike keratoconus.


Investigational procedures:

Corneal topography or videokeratography: Corneal topography or videokeratography show diffuse thinning.
Ultrasonic pachymetry: Ultrasonic pachymetry shows reduced corneal thickness.
Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS- OCT).
Scheimpflug analysis: A Scheimpflug system images the anterior segment by creating an optical section of the cornea. Topography and pachymetry of the cornea is calculated and displayed which shows generalised thinning.


Systemic examination may show features of blue sclera, skeletal abnormalities, hyper-mobility of joints, hearing loss, abnormal dentition or high-arched palate. There may be features specific to each syndrome. It has been seen in few cases that keratoglobus in association with blue sclera syndromes is more probable to undergo spontaneous perforation or after minimal trauma, and hence the name ‘brittle cornea’ is used.

Histopathology:
There are frequent disruptions or complete absence of Bowman’s layer, stromal thinning and disorganisation, and breaks or thickening of Descemet’s membrane. Acquired type of keratoglobus is characterised by an essentially normal Bowman’s layer that undergoes focal breaks with superficial stromal ectasia secondary to other corneal pathology.
Immunohistochemical studies: There are limited immunohistochemical studies in cases of keratoglobus. Meghpara et al. (2009) found decreased expression of proteinase inhibitor alpha-1-PI, and increased expression of the transcription factor Sp1 in the corneal epithelial cells. They found increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 2, and 3 within the epithelial cells. The MMPs are responsible for degradation of some component of the extracellular matrix. Increased Sp1 and MMP 1, 2, and 3 was found diffusely throughout the cornea, but maximally at the mid-periphery and corresponded to areas of underlying Bowman’s layer disruptions. The increased expression of pro-degradation products and decreased expression of inhibitory substances is most probably a key pathogenic factor in causing ectasia.

Differential diagnosis:

Keratoconus: Keratoconus develops around puberty and may progress until 40–50 years of age, whereas keratoglobus presents at birth. Keratoglobus is considered a non-progressive or minimally progressive disorder. The corneal thinning in keratoconus is most commonly seen in the inferior paracentral aspect of the cornea. The protrusion is commonly described as conical in shape, with maximal thinning at the apex. Keratoglobus presents with diffuse thinning and a globular protrusion. Keratoconus shows scarring, Vogt’s striae and Fleischer’s ring.
Pellucid marginal degeneration: Pellucid marginal degeneration presents around 20–40 years of age. Thinning involves the inferior aspect of cornea, as a band of 1–2 mm width and extending from 4 to 8 o’clock position. Protrusion occur superior to this area of thinning, leading to characteristic topographical patterns. Scarring and hydrops may also occur as well.
Congenital glaucoma: Congenital glaucoma may show moderate protrusion of the cornea, hydrops, and mild astigmatism with myopia. Hallmark of Congenital glaucoma is raised intraocular pressure and possible glaucomatous optic nerve changes that would be absent in the case of keratoglobus. There is no corneal thinning and corneal diameters may be increased. In congenital glaucoma, the myopia would result primarily from the increased anterior and posterior axial length, whereas in keratoglobus it would be mainly because of the increased corneal curvature.
Megalocornea: In megalocornea, the main differentiating feature is the increased corneal diameter (usually over 12.5 mm) with absence of any corneal thinning. This is in contrast to keratoglobus where corneal diameters are normal and there is profound, diffuse thinning. There is therefore an absence of any corneal protrusion, astigmatism, hydrops, or scarring in cases of megalocornea.
Corneal ectasia following refractive surgery.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Conservative therapy:

Protective eye wear: Patients should use protective eye wear and avoid contact sports owing to the high risk of perforation. Enforcement of use of protective glasses is difficult in children, making them susceptible to injury.

Medical therapy:

Spectacle correction: High myopia may be corrected with spectacles, but is limited by high irregular astigmatism.
Contact lenses: Use of contact lenses is still a matter of debate because of the theoretical risk of perforation on contact lens insertion and removal over corneas that are known to perforate on even trivial trauma. The extreme protrusion and irregularity makes fitting complicated, with a need for balance between optical improvement and lens stability. Customised fitting of scleral lenses, small diameter rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, reverse geometry hydrogel lenses, as well as large diameter inverse geometry RGP lenses have been described for corneal ectasias.

Conventional treatment of acute hydrops is nonspecific, and involves the use of patching, bandage contact lens, topical hypertonic saline, and cycloplegics to reduce the oedema. In recent years intra-cameral (in anterior chamber of eye) gas has been tried for acute hydrops.
Surgical therapy:
Surgically, there is no known standard procedure for management of the condition owing to its rarity. Individual procedures have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Repair of perforations: Repair of perforations commonly resulted in poor outcomes because of the nature of the perforations that are usually large, and owing to the fragility of the thinned cornea that prevented stable placement of sutures that would cut through or ‘cheese-wire’.
Penetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty in keratoglobus is also not possible because of the thinned cornea and peripheral graft–host thickness disparity that prevents adequate wound closure. Patients also are left with extreme irregular astigmatism and ultimately poor visual outcome. Large limbus to limbus donor corneal grafts have been tried to avoid placement of the graft–host junction at the thinned mid-periphery, thereby creating better stability.
Pentacam- based deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): In deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), the anterior third to two-thirds of the cornea is replaced with donor tissue. Use of pentacam provides a three-dimensional image or thickness profile of the entire cornea preoperatively.
Corneoscleroplasty: Corneoscleroplasty involves a central full thickness penetrating keratoplasty with a lamellar peripheral corneoscleral dissection from the edge of the full thickness keratoplasty.
Epikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty is a rare form of surgery. This is a type of on-lay lamellar keratoplasty in which a lens made of human corneal tissue is sutured onto the anterior surface of the cornea to change its anterior curvature and refraction.
‘Tuck-in’ lamellar keratoplasty: ‘Tuck-in’ lamellar keratoplasty refers to a central lamellar keratoplasty with intrastromal tucking of the peripheral flange.
Corneoscleral rim: Corneoscleral rim is a temporary measure to provide tectonic stability over thinned corneal periphery. It slows progression of mid- peripheral thinning and delays further surgical intervention.

Prognosis:
The prognosis for keratoglobus is poor. Spectacle correction often results in sub-optimal ‘best corrected visual acuity’ (BCVA).
Surgical correction may be associated with complications."

This is just an indicative information. For diagnosis and treatment you should consult your doctor.","Diagnosis and treatment of Kala-Azar are problematic because of a variety of reasons. While treatment is lengthy and relatively costly, definitive diagnosis of Kala-Azar requires tissue specimens, which are conventionally obtained by organ needle aspiration for microscopic demonstration of amastigote forms in stained smears. Bone marrow the spleen, and lymph-node (in some regions) are the tissues most often sampled in patients with suspected infection. The diagnostic sensitivity of splenic aspiration is high (95% - 98%), but the procedure carries a risk of bleeding; the sensitivity of examination of bone marrow specimens is considered to be lower (53% - 95%). Organ aspiration and accurate examination of smears also require technical skills that are not uniformly available in rural areas.

Leprosy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/leprosy,"Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease (HD), is a chronic infectious disease caused by a Mycobacterium (Mycobacterium leprae) affecting especially the skin and marginal nerves. It is characterized by the formation of nodules or macules that enlarge and spread with loss of sensation and eventually paralysis, wasting of muscle, and production of deformities called also Hansen's disease. This infection is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. It is primarily a granulomatous disease of the peripheral nerves and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, skin lesions are the primary external sign. If left untreated, leprosy can be progressive, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes.
Despite the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem (defined as achieving a point prevalence of below 1 per 10 000 population) globally in 2000 and at a national level in most countries by 2005, leprosy cases continue to occur. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), 216108 new leprosy cases were reported globally in 2016.

(2) thickened or enlarged peripheral nerve, with loss of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by that nerve;
(3) presence of acid-fast bacilli in a slit-skin smear
Leprosy is classified as paucibacillary (PB) or multibacillary (MB), based on the number of skin lesions, presence of nerve involvement and identification of bacilli on slit-skin smear.
Paucibacillary (PB) case: a case of leprosy with 1 to 5 skin lesions, without demonstrated presence of bacilli in a skin smear;
Multibacillary (MB) case: a case of leprosy with more than five skin lesions; or with nerve involvement (pure neuritis, or any number of skin lesions and neuritis); or with the demonstrated presence of bacilli in a slit-skin smear, irrespective of the number of skin lesions.","The multidrug therapy (MDT) is an effective and a powerful tool in curing leprosy. Adherence to treatment and its successful completion are equally important for the cure.
The currently recommended MDT for PB leprosy is rifampicin and dapsone for 6 months and the currently recommended MDT for MB leprosy is rifampicin, clofazimine and dapsone for 12 months. MDT treatment is provided in blister packs, each containing four weeks’ treatment. Specific blister packs are available for multibacillary (MB) and paucibacillary (PB) leprosy as well for adults and children.
Recommended treatment regimens (WHO guidelines 2017*)
Multi drug therapy which consists of 3-drug regimen of rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine for all leprosy patients, with a duration of treatment of 6 months for PB leprosy and 12 months for MB leprosy is recommended by WHO guidelines 2017*.
(For rifampicin-resistant leprosy, the guidelines recommend treatment with at least two second-line drugs (clarithromycin, minocycline or a quinolone) plus clofazimine daily for 6 months, followed by clofazimine plus one of these drugs for an additional 18 months.)

Leukemia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/leukemia,"Leukemia is group of blood cancers of white cells.

Acute leukemiais identified by a rapid increase in the number of immature blood cells. Congestion due to immature blood cells makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells. Prompt treatment is required in acute leukemia due to the rapid progression and accumulation of the cells, which then leak into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body. Acute forms of leukemia are the most common forms of leukemia in children.

Induction – The aim of the initial stage of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in bone marrow, and restore blood for proper working order and resolve any symptoms
Consolidation – The aim is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may be present in central nervous system.
Maintenance – the final stage involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukemia returning.

Treatment for chronic leukemia:
Chemotherapy: It is found very effective especially in chronic cases. Combinations of fludarabine with alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide) produce higher response rates and a longer progression-free survival than single agent.
Bone marrow and stem cell transplants: For chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia is to have a bone marrow or stem cell transplant is another option.
It is just an indicative information. Please consult your doctor for further diagnosis and treatment."
Lymphoedema,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/lymphoedema,"It is also known as Lymphatic Obstruction, is a condition of localizedfluidretention and tissue swelling caused by a compromisedlymphatic system. The lymphatic system returns theinterstitial fluidto the thoracic ductand then to the bloodstream, where it is re circulated back to the tissues.
There are two main types of lymphoedema:

Primary Lymphoedema– whichdevelops at birth or afterpubertyand is caused by faulty genes.
Secondary Lymphoedema–caused by damage to the lymphatic system as a result of an infection, injury, trauma, orcancer.","The main symptom of lymphoedemais swelling in all or part of a limb. 
Other symptoms include:

the affected limb feeling heavy and aching
the affected limb losing some of its mobility
pain in the affected limb
painful joints, such as the elbow or knee, caused by swelling in the limb
repeated skin infections in the affected limb","There are two types of Lymphoedema- Primary and Secondary lymphoedema, which have different causes.
Primary lymphoedema:
It is due to alterations (known as mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system.
Secondary lymphoedema: some of the common causes are-
Surgical treatment of cancer
Cancer spreads around the body via the lymphatic system and so part of the treatment can involve surgically removing the cancerous lymph nodes. There is asignificant risk of lymphoedema occurring as a complication of treatment for:

Breast Cancer
Skin Cancer
Gynaecological Cancers, such ascervical cancerand vulval cancer
Genitourinary Cancers, such asprostate canceror penile cancer

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapyuses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous tissue. However, it at times also damage healthy tissue.
Venous diseases
Venous diseases, which affect the flow of blood through the veins, can cause lymphoedema in some people. The abnormal or damaged veins can result in excess blood or fluid building up in tissues, which causes tissue damage. This can affect the drainage of the lymphatic system.
Some venous diseases that can lead to lymphoedema include:

Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)– A blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body
Varicose Veins(swollen and enlarged veins)– Where poor drainage of blood in the veins causes higher vein pressure and more fluid passes into the tissues

Infections
In some cases, an infection can cause lymphoedema.
Cellulitisis a bacterial skin infection that can cause lymphoedema, it is also sometimes a complication of the condition. A severe cellulitis infection can damage the tissue around lymph nodes or vessels, leading to scarring.
Another infectious cause of lymphoedema is a parasite infection calledfilariasis. This can be common in parts of the developing world, such as parts of India.
Inflammation
Conditions that cause tissue to become inflamed (red and swollen) can also permanently damage the lymphatic system. Health conditions that can cause lymphoedema include:

Rheumatoid Arthritis–which causes pain and swelling in the joints
Eczema–whichcauses the skin to become itchy, reddened, dry and cracked","Measuring limb volume- These tests are explained below:
Tape measure
A tape measure is used at 4cm (1.6in) intervals up the leg to measure the limb circumference and then calculate limb volume.
Water displacement method:
The water displacement method is based on the principle that helps to calculate the volume of an object by measuring how much water it displaces.
Patient will be asked to place the affected limb in a tank of water and the amount of water that is displaced will then be measured. This measurement can be used to calculate the volume of limb.
Perometry
Perometry is a technique that uses infrared light to measure the volume of limb. This process can accurately calculate how swollen affected limb is.
Imaging tests
Imaging tests may also be used to help in the diagnosis. These include:

A Lymphoscintigraph–where radioactive dye is injected, it can be tracked using a special scanner, this shows how the dye moves through lymphatic system and can check for any blockages.
A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan–which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of body.
An Ultrasound Scan–which uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of body.

Acomputerised (axial) tomography (CT or CAT) scan–which uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the veins or lymph nodes.","The recommended treatment for lymphoedema is a treatment plan called Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT). It is also known as Decongestive Lymphatic Therapy (DLT).
There are four components to CDT treatment:

Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD)is a specialized massage technique designed to stimulate the flow of fluid and reduce swelling.
Multilayer lymphoedema bandaging (MLLB) uses bandages and compression garments to move fluid out of the affected limb.
Remedial exercises designed to activate muscles in the limb to improve lymph drainage.
Skin careis required to prevent infection."
Ligneous Conjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/ligneous-conjunctivitis,"Ligneous conjunctivitis (LC) is a rare, potentially sight and even life-threatening (e.g. by airway obstruction) disorder characterised by recurrent, often bilateral fibrin-rich pseudo-membranous lesions of wood-like consistency that develop mainly on the tarsal conjunctiva. It is the main clinical manifestation of systemic plasminogen deficiency and typically presents in childhood. There appears to be a higher incidence in females as compared to males. With plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as conjunctiva. Plasminogen is converted to plasmin by plasminogen activators in the blood. Plasmin is a serine protease and is the predominant fibrinolytic enzyme in the human circulation, and is also found in the extracellular matrix. Plasmin plays an important role in haemostasis, as well as, is an integral component of wound healing (acts by degrading fibrin). Due to plasminogen deficiency, fibrin rich membranes or mucous strands accumulate, which on desiccation of the fibrin leads to the ligneous consistency of the conjunctival lesions. Episodes may be triggered by relatively minor trauma, surgery (done particularly for pterygium or pinguecula) or by systemic events such as fever and anti-fibrinolytic therapy. Similar mechanisms occur in extra-ocular manifestations of plasminogen deficiency.
Bouisson in 1847 first described a man with bilateral pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis (Bouisson M. Ophthalmic sur-aigue avec formation de pseudo-membranes a la surface de la conjonctive. Ann Ocul, 1847; 17: 100-4). In 1933, the term ‘ligneous’, meaning ‘woody’ was introduced by Borel to describe the characteristic wood-like consistency of the pseudo-membranes (Borel MG. Un nouveau syndrome palpebral. Bull Soc Fr Ophthalmol 1933; 46: 168-80). However, the link between LC and plasminogen deficiency was established in 1997 by Mingers et al (Mingers AM, Heimburger N, Zeitler P, et al. Homozygous type I plasminogen deficiency. Semin Thromb Hemost 1997; 23:259-69). As many patients develop similar pseudo-membranes in other mucous membranes of the body, Mingers et al. suggested the term ‘pseudo-membranous disease’ to describe the systemic nature of this disease. Although the lesions have been referred to as pseudo-membranous (a pseudo-membrane consists of a loose fibrin-cellular debris exudates not adherent to the underlying epithelium, from which it can be easily stripped, usually without bleeding) in the literature, the lesions are actually true membranes (a true membrane consists of an exudate of fibrin-cellular debris firmly attached to the underlying epithelium by fibrin. On attempted removal, the epithelium is stripped off and leaves a raw bleeding surface).
LC is rare, and the prevalence of this disorder has not been firmly established. LC can occur in older individuals, despite it being classically associated with infants and children.
Less frequently, LC may lead to similar membrane formation in mucous membranes of other organs, such as:

Oral cavity (ligneous gingivitis).
Gastrointestinal tracts.
Upper and lower respiratory tracts (sinus, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs).
Ears.
Female genital tracts.
Renal collecting system.

Rarely, it may also cause:

Juvenile colloid milium of the skin.
Occlusive hydrocephalus.

Several studies have shown extra-ocular manifestations of severe plasminogen deficiency even without ocular involvement.
Histopathological findings indicate that impaired wound healing, mainly of injured mucosal tissue, is due to markedly decreased, plasmin-mediated extracellular fibrinolysis.
LC is characterised by multiple recurrences after local excision, and management involves the adjunctive use of topical and systemic replacement of plasminogen.","Patients typically present with chronic conjunctivitis and LC is bilateral in about half of the cases. Duration of disease varies from few months to many years.
According to the severity, ocular (eye) symptoms may be:
Early cases show:

Redness.
Chronic watering.
Mild discomfort.
Pain.
Photophobia (sensitivity to light).
White or red masses on conjunctiva.

Severe cases may have:

Constant discomfort which affect daily activities.
Lesions may extend beyond the lid margin.
Membranes.


      A conjunctival lesion is commonly noted by parents. 
Systemic symptoms:
Oro-pharynx:
After conjunctival involvement, the second most frequently affected site is mouth. There may be:

Loss of dental integrity.
Painless nodular ulcers.
Hyperplasia of gums.

Ears:

Fluctuating hearing loss.
Chronic infection of tympanic membrane and middle ear.

Respiratory Tract:

Dysphonia (change in voice).
Chest infections or recurrent pneumonia.
Potentially life-threatening airway obstruction.

Genitourinary Tract:
Ligneous lesions occurring in the female genital tract, most commonly affects cervix, causing ligneous cervicitis. Lesions may also involve vagina, fallopian tubes, ovary and endometrium of uterus. This may cause:

Dysmenorrhoea - the most common presenting symptom.
Infertility.

Juvenile Colloid Milium of the skin:
This is a rare skin condition characterised by the development of small, yellow-brown, translucent papules.
Congenital Occlusive Hydrocephalus:
LC patients may rarely have congenital occlusive hydrocephalus.","There is evidence to support that ligneous conjunctivitis is the result of plasminogen deficiency.
There are two types of plasminogen deficiency:

Type I (hypo-plasminogenaemia) is a quantitative deficiency.
Type II (dys-plasminogenaemia) is a qualitative deficiency.

Type I deficiency is the type most associated with LC.
With plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as the conjunctiva. The impaired wound healing capacity causes an arrest of granulation tissue formation and excessive fibrin deposition. Thus, fibrin rich membranes or mucous strands accumulate, stimulating inflammatory cells and fibroblasts, while desiccation of the fibrin leads to the ligneous consistency of the conjunctival lesions. Similar patho-physiologic mechanisms occur in extra-ocular manifestations of plasminogen deficiency.
While in extra-vascular spaces, fibrinolysis, with low to non-existent levels of plasminogen activity, is impaired. However, in vessels this is not the case, as can be inferred from the fact that thrombotic phenomena is absent in patients with LC and plasminogen deficiency. It has been suggested that non-plasmin induced fibrinolysis is intensified in patients with plasminogen deficiency and ligneous conjunctivitis.
Genetics of disease:
Genetics of the disease allows for prenatal diagnosis in known carrier families, which may be crucial in cases of obstructive congenital hydrocephalous.
Development of ligneous lesions is caused by:


Sporadic mutations in plasminogen gene. This is the most common cause. The gene for plasminogen is located on chromosome 6, and is produced predominantly by the liver.
Compound-heterozygous mutations.
Homozygous mutations.
Tissue injury:
Due to the appearance, histopathology, clinical course, and response to treatment, it is also believed that LC results from an exaggerated inflammatory response to tissue injury. This injury may arise from infection or physical trauma, including surgery. These factors may incite a genetic predisposition, such as plasminogen deficiency, to develop this response. Schuster and Seregard also postulated that conjunctivitis is the most common manifestation of plasminogen deficiency, due to frequent exposure to ocular irritants (Schuster V, Seregard S. Ligneous Conjunctivitis. Surv Ophthalmol 2003; 48: 369-88). These irritants may start or perpetuate local inflammation and create ligneous membranes.
Many cases of antecedent viral or bacterial infections have been described, including staphylococcal, streptococcal, and haemophilus conjunctivitis. In these cases, it appears that LC, in genetically susceptible individuals, develops as an abnormal response to the conjunctival trauma elicited by the infecting organisms.
Trauma, especially from surgery, is also thought to be a cause of LC. LC appears to develop as an abnormal response of the immune system to the conjunctival trauma.","The diagnosis of LC is based on the clinical picture (ocular and/or extra-ocular membranous lesions), the typical histological findings, and a possible positive family history. In most patients with LC, hypo-plasminogenaemia may be found.
If the responsible mutation has been identified in an affected family, then prenatal diagnosis of children at risk is possible.
Ocular Features:
Examination of eyes should be carried out under slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye-specialist.
Patients typically present with chronic conjunctivitis. Discharge or membranes are not seen in the early stages.
Conjunctival ligneous lesions: The earliest true ligneous lesion appears as a highly vascularised, raised, friable lesion. It may be covered by a thick yellow-white mucoid discharge. This lesion can be removed easily with forceps, although it tends to bleed on removal. With continued inflammation, a white, thickened, avascular mass appears above the neo-vascular membrane. Attempts at removal of this lesion often results in recurrence of the lesion to its original size within days. These lesions are most often seen on the palpebral conjunctiva of the upper and lower eyelids but may also be found on the bulbar conjunctiva, including the limbus. Bulbar conjunctival involvement may occur either de novo or from extension of a palpebral lesion. Despite appropriate therapy, inflammation may continue, and the chronic lesions become thickened, vascularised, and firm, giving rise to the name ‘ligneous’ meaning woody.
Corneal lesions: Limbal lesions may extend over the surface of the cornea and may lead to corneal:

Neovascularisation.
Scarring.
Infection.
Melting.

Systemic Features:
Fever or infections of the upper respiratory tract, urinary tract, or female genital tract, may either precede or concomitantly occur with LC, or might even act as a trigger for the development of membranes.
Oro-pharynx:
Membranous lesions may cause:

Loss of dental integrity.
Painless nodular ulcers.
Gingival hyperplasia.

Ears:
Membranous lesions may occur on:

Tympanic membrane.
Middle ear causing otitis media.

Respiratory Tract:
Ligneous lesions may involve:

Larynx.
Vocal cords.
Trachea.
Bronchial tree.

Genitourinary Tract:
Ligneous lesions in female genital tract may involve:

Cervix causing ligneous cervicitis.
Vagina.
Fallopian tubes.
Ovary.
Endometrium.

Juvenile Colloid Milium:
This is a rare skin condition characterised by the development of small, yellow-brown, translucent papules, typically in sun-exposed areas of the skin. It tends to occur prior to puberty.
Congenital Occlusive Hydrocephalus:
LC patients are also reported to suffer from congenital occlusive hydrocephalus.
Laboratory diagnosis:

Abnormality of plasminogen activity and/or antigen: Laboratory analysis confirms disorder with an abnormality of plasminogen activity and/or antigen. Since ligneous lesions are most commonly seen in type I plasminogen deficiency, the antigen test alone is insufficient to rule out this disease.
Prenatal testing: Prenatal testing to identify genetic mutations may be conducted to identify this disease.

Histopathological/ Immuno-histochemical evaluation:
Histological examination of ligneous membranes shows superficial or sub-epithelial deposits of eosinophilic amorphous hyaline, amyloid-like material with a variable proportion of granulation tissue with accompanying inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells and granulocytes). This amorphous hyaline material contains mainly fibrin and other plasma proteins, such as albumin and immune-globulins (mainly IgG). Ligneous lesions may also contain variable amounts of muco-polysaccharides in adjacent granulation tissue. Abnormal vascular permeability has also been suggested as the source of various components of the ligneous lesions. Melikian postulated that a sero-fibrinous transudate from the conjunctival neovascularisation undergoes subsequent coagulation, with the resulting formation of granulation tissue and accumulation of the hyaline material, which becomes hardened and form ligneous membranes. (Melikian H E. Treatment of ligneous conjunctivitis. Ann Ophthalmol 1985; 17: 763-65)
Immuno-histochemical evaluation of LC lesions showed a cellular infiltrate that was composed mainly of T lymphocytes. Immuno-fluorescent techniques demonstrated that the major components of the hyaline material in the substantia propria were immune-globulins (mainly IgG).
Topical cyclosporine A has been reported to be more effective than other topical agents (short of plasminogen preparations) in the treatment of this disorder. Cyclosporine A prevents the activation and recruitment of the T-cell response. Finally, a decrease in the number of B lymphocytes and plasma cells occur. These results indicate the local effect of cyclosporine A on the immune-response. The clinical response and histopathological confirmation of the effect of Cyclosporine A further support the inflammatory nature of this disease.
Ligneous conjunctivitis should be differentiated from:
Any inflammatory or infectious disease which can cause a chronic pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis, such as:

Viral conjunctivitis:

Herpes simplex infection.
Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.
Molluscum contagiosum.

Bacterial conjunctivitis:

Staphylococcus aureus.
Streptococcus haemolyticus.
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Chlamydia trachomatis.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

Allergic conjunctivitis:

Vernal keratoconjunctivitis.

Toxic conjunctivitis:
Chemical conjunctivitis:

Acid.
Alkali.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Amyloidosis.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Management of LC tends to be unsatisfactory and spontaneous resolution is rare.
It is important to discontinue any anti-fibrinolytic therapy.
Medical therapy:


Plasminogen substitution: Systemic and topical plasminogen substitution or Fresh Frogen Plasma (FFP) is presently being investigated as the primary treatment for ligneous conjunctivitis. Mingers et al. first proposed the theory of plasminogen deficiency and attempted supplementing plasminogen. Topical plasminogen preparations, extracted from fresh frozen plasma, have successfully been used in the treatment of LC. Using FFP bypasses, the need for plasminogen concentrate alone, which has a very short half-life and is difficult to have it readily available.

Cyclosporine A: Cyclosporine A had been the most promising element in the therapeutic management before plasminogen. 




Other measures: Based on the early observations of the presence of granulation tissue and inflammatory cells in ligneous tissue, topical medical regimens toward these non-specific findings were developed. Topical therapy including, topical hyaluronidase, heparin, azathioprine, alpha-chymotrypsin, sodium cromoglycate, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and fibrinolysin have shown limited success.


Surgical therapy:
Because trauma to the conjunctiva is likely to be an aetiological factor in LC, conjunctival surgery must be performed with utmost care.


Excision of ligneous lesions: Systemic and topical plasminogen or FFP treatment is started to help soften the pseudo-membrane and facilitate removal. Complete excision with diathermy of the base of all ocular ligneous lesions is done. General anaesthesia may be used in adults with significant disease, and in all children. Failure to completely remove the lesion results in rapid recurrence, because the retained lesion acts as physical barrier to topical medical treatment.



Immediately after surgery, the patient is continued on systemic and topical FFP, and started on a corticosteroid, broad-spectrum antibiotic and topical cyclosporine A. These medications are given after surgery, as early recurrence is the hallmark of this disorder.

A small but significant amount of recurrence will be seen daily in every patient, and every recurrent lesion must be debrided daily. If abnormal tissue is allowed to collect for even 1 to 2 days, it will act as a barrier and prevent the topical medications from reaching the basal tissue, which is the origin of ligneous membranes.

Repeat excision is conducted for the recurrent lesions.



Amniotic membrane transplantation: Barbino and Rolando performed amniotic membrane transplantation for conjunctival reconstruction of LC. (Barabino S, Rolando M. Amniotic membrane transplantation in a case of ligneous conjunctivitis. Am J Ophthalmol 2004; 137: 752-753)



Surgical intervention may be needed to relieve obstruction in patients with congenital occlusive hydrocephalus.

Prognosis:
The prognosis for ligneous conjunctivitis is variable and is based upon the extent, length and the affected site producing symptoms. It depends on the ability to control inflammation and recurrence of pseudo-membranes. Patients with corneal involvement have poorer visual prognosis.
Many patients have lived into adulthood. Many patients experienced significant morbidity, including loss of function of an affected organ, such as loss of sight or loss of dentition.
Systemic involvement of respiratory tract (tracheo-bronchial lesions) with pseudo-membranes may be life threatening due to respiratory failure. This group of patients are in need of specific therapy that treat and prevent these lesions and the sequelae thereof.
The quality of life of untreated patients with significant disease is not optimal."
Low Vision and VisuaI Aids,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/low-vision-and-visuai-aids,"Visionis the special sense by which the qualities of an object (as colour, luminosity, shape, and size) constituting its appearance are perceived through a process in which light rays entering the eye are transformed by the retina(light sensitive inner layer of eyeball) into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve .
Visual acuityis a measure of resolution of the visual processing system. It is measured commonly with an eye chart e.g. Snellen chart. A common Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. In visual acuity testing on Snellen chart, person normally sits at a distance of 6 meters from the chart on which letters of standard decreasing size are there in rows. Top line has a single letter which should be readable at a distance of 60 meters. Visual acuity is recorded as a ratio with numerator of 6 (distance at which patient sits.) and the denominator of the smallest possible size being read by the patient. For example, a vision record of 6/60 means that patient sitting at 6 meters could read letter in top line only , which should normally be read at 60 meters. Instead of distances being in meters, it may also be measured in feet. 6 meters is about 20 feet. Therefore, a vision of 6/6 in meters, is equivalent to a vision of 20/20 in feet. Similarly, a vision of 6/60 in meters, is equal to 20/200 in feet.
Typical Snellen chart to estimate visual acuity:Image in Wikipedia(link is external)  
Low visionwas defined as ‘Visual acuity of 6/18 down to and including 3/60 in the better eye’. A person with low vision is ‘someone who, after medical, surgical and/or optical intervention, has a corrected visual acuity in the better eye of &lt;6/18 down to and including light perception or a central visual field of &lt;20 degrees, but who uses or has the potential to use vision for the planning and/or execution of a task.’ Thus, Low vision is a reduced level of vision that cannot be fully corrected with conventional glasses. In 10threvision of the International classification of the diseases (ICD-10 version: 2015), the term low vision is replaced by terms‘moderatevisual impairment(presenting visual acuity of &lt;6/18 to 6/60)’ and‘severe visualimpairment(presenting visual acuity of &lt;6/60 to 3/60)’, from all causes.
‘ Vision 2020: the Right to Sight’ is a partnership between World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Agency for the prevention of Blindness(IAPB), had been launched in 1999 with the twin aims of eliminating avoidable blindness by the year 2020 and preventing the projected doubling of avoidable visual impairment between 1990 and 2020 . VISION 2020 advocates for increased awareness of the need for low vision services. Low vision services are aimed at people who have residual vision that can be used and enhanced by specific aids. A low vision resource centre is operating from Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China, to distribute high quality, affordable low vision devices and equipment to all regions.","Symptoms of Low vision:- In spite of best medical, surgical and/or optical correction, there is :-

Difficulty recognising objects at distance.
Difficulty in reading or close work.
Difficulty in colour differentiation.","Causes of Low Vision:- 

Age-related Macular Degeneration- Macula , the area on the retina responsible for sharp central vision, is affected causing diminished vision.
Refractive Errors like High Myopia
Strabismic Amblyopia
Cataract - A cataract is clouding of lens in eye, thereby decreasing vision. Though treated surgically, few associated with ocular diseases may benefit with Low vision aids.
Diabetic Retinopathy- In Diabetes, due to hypoxia ( less oxygen supply to retina ), there are vascular changes leading to haemorrhages (bleeding) and exudates ( leaks from vessel ). These changes in Macula may produce diminution of vision.
Glaucoma– In Glaucoma, there is rise in intraocular pressure leading to damage to the optic nerve and diminution of vision.
Retinal Detachment– Retina may separate from its underlying layer and leads to diminution of vision.
Retinitis Pigmentosa- An inherited disease, usually affects peripheral vision to begin with, leads to night blindness.
Retinopathy of Prematurity–Retinal vessels are not fully developed in premature infants. Premature infants are kept on oxygen in incubator. There is relative hypoxia in peripheral part of retina, which leads to new vessel formation and other complications, leading to diminution of vision.
Optic Nerve Diseases like Optic Atrophy
Heredomacular degeneration (Stargardt’s disease)
Albinism
Nystagmus
Brain damage– There may be injury or disease of brain which may affect vision","Most people requiring visual aids have macular problems. Tests are done to assess the degree of vision and the visual field.
It includes :-

Refraction – As full a refraction as possible, should be attempted, and a subjective test should be performed with special test types. It is done to check the visual status of an individual. A trial frame and lenses should always be used, not a large refracting unit, which may interfere with eccentric viewing. Similarly, for near vision, special charts indicate reading vision and the magnification or addition required to attain a particular level.
Visual fields – It is done to assess the peripheral vision.","Many of the patients are old and frequently relatively immobile so that the retention of some ability to read is of vital importance. Low vision aids improve the reading capability and speed of reading. Visual aids for distance are less practical than those for near.
Accurate refraction and appropriate illumination should be ensured for optimal retinal image.
Magnification is the basis of most techniques used in low vision clinic. There are three methods of enlarging the retinal image :-

By bringing the object nearer to the eye.
By magnification of the retinal image.
By increasing the size of the object to be viewed.

Bringing the object nearer to the eye, leads to larger visual angle being subtended at the eye.
Magnification, though increases the size of retinal image, leads to diminished visual field and reduced depth of focus. Due to this, lighting should be ample and directed on the fixation area. Therefore, lowest magnification compatible with useful vision should be employed .
Low vision aids may be -

Optical devices, such as magnifiers and telescopes.
Adaptive non-optical devices, such as large-print reading material and talking watches.
Non-magnifying visual aids.
Electronic devices - computer software.

OPTICAL DEVICES:-
Hand-held Magnifiers:- Hand – held magnifiers are the simplest type of magnifiers. The hand-held magnifier design involves a handle that is attached to a plus lens through which the user views an object. Since user must support the weight of magnifier, hand-held magnifiers are helpful for short term spotting task, like reading a prescription bottle or a price tag. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers with a variety of lens designs e.g. aspheric , aplanatic , biconvex , and diffractive lens.
Image in Wikipedia(link is external).
Stand Magnifiers:- Stand Magnifier is a plus lens mounted on legs that fix the distance from the lens to object. Stand Magnifiers are good for extended, near tasks such as reading a book, newspaper or magazine and making small notes. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers. There are around-the- neck magnifiers , for jobs which require both hands to be free, like sewing and knitting.
Some magnifiers may use variations like :

Combination of lenses are also extensively used in magnifiers e.g. Hastings triplet magnifier.
Stepped lenses introduced by Fresnel can also be used as magnifiers. One type is essentially a plastic sheet with concentric ridges forming a series of prisms of increasing power from the axis to the periphery and has the great advantage of eliminating the thickness and marked aberration that would be unavoidable in a single large lens with a continuous surface.

Magnifying Reading Glasses:- Magnifying reading glasses have plus lenses for short term use as a replacement, but cannot substitute the prescription glasses. These may be having constant power or are progressive to be used for varying reading distances . These may be of illuminated type, which can be used in the dark.
Spectacle Magnifiers:- Spectacle magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks like reading or working on hobbies because they allow users to have ‘ hands free’. These may be:

Clip– on system :- To be worn over the glasses.
Prismatic eye wear :- Prisms are incorporated in spectacle to aid monocular or binocular vision. These may be bifocal, with normal reading power in upper part, and prismatic high power in the lower part for reading fine print.
Noves spectacle magnifier :- It uses diffractive lenses which are much thinner than the lenses of similar power.
Spectacle microscope magnifiers :- Have lenses of greater power than a traditional lens which forms a microscopic system when mounted on a spectacle lens. By holding the object closer, it allows an increase sized image with large field of view and clarity.

Telescopes:- Telescopes as vision aids, are ideal for tasks at any distance ( near, intermediate or far ) and for any duration of time ( short term or long term ). Telescopes may be monocular or binocular, focusable or fixed-focus, hand-held or spectacle mounted.
Technical Magnifier:- Technical magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks such as inspection, quality control or viewing objects. Technical magnifiers may be hand-held magnifiers or stand magnifiers.
High power magnifiers are sometimes mounted in a cylindrical or conical holder with no handle. This is called a Loupe. These may be monocular loupe e.g. jewellers’ and watchmakers’ loupes or binocular.

Loupe :Image in Wikipedia(link is external)
Binocular dental loupes:Image in Wikipedia(link is external)

Aplanatic system of lenses such as exemplified in ophthalmic loupe, diminishes distortion of images.
Lamp Magnifiers:- Lamp magnifiers sit on or clamp on to a table or desk and have illumination. These are good for extended near to intermediate tasks that need both magnification and illumination in a hands-free design.
NON- OPTICAL DEVICES:- Increasing the size of the object to be viewed helps in approach to low vision e.g. Large-size telephone bills or large-size print books. The benefits of optical devices, may be enhanced by non-optical means, such as improving light or reducing glare.
Flexible-Arm Task Lamps:- Flexible-arm task lamps can be adjusted to a variety of tasks by providing proper light.
Full Spectrum Light Bulbs:- Full spectrum light bulbs provide full range of colours found in sunlight, and hence more natural light. A sunscreen may be needed for longer duration of work, just as working out door in sunlight.
Absorptive Sun lenses/Sun glasses:- Absorptive sun lenses filter out ultraviolet and infrared light. These are helpful in bright light , reduce glare and increase contrast.
Coloured Acetate Sheetsz- Coloured acetate sheets, especially yellow or marigold, when placed on the page, can enhance contrast between the print and background, making words and letters appear darker and easier to read.
NON- MAGNIFYING VISUAL AIDS:-
Stenopaeic Hole:- Stenopaeic hole is useful in any error of refraction or where the transparency of the ocular media is at fault. It is useful to a presbyope to read or write in an emergency.
As a stenopaeic slit, it may protect against ultraviolet radiation reflected from the snow.
As a reading slit cut in dark cardboard or plastic material, when placed immediately over print, may help patients with early lens opacities. In such cases, reflected light from the page is decreased and the contrast is thereby increased, allowing greater clarity in reading.
ELECTRONIC DEVICES:-
Video Magnifiers:- Video magnifiers use video cameras to project a magnified image onto a video monitor , a television (TV ) screen, or a computer monitor. Video magnifiers use stand-mounted or hand-held video cameras and are also called ‘closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems’. Apart from the undistorted magnification, CCTV offers two other advantages. The polarity may be reversed, allowing the print to be offered as white on black, the contrast is found helpful by some patients. It is possible to isolate one line of print, which may make it more intelligible.

Hand-held video magnifiers rest against the reading material and generally have a small integrated display. Some hand-held magnifiers can project magnified image on a television.
Stand-mounted like Desktop video magnifiers have a table surface on which the object is placed. Above the object, is a camera and monitor upon which the magnified image is projected.

Newer Technologies:- Advances in consumer electronics is improving quality of life for people with low vision. Digital devices and apps offer options for portable, lower-cost low vision aids.
E- readers- The iPad and other electronic- readers are portable, and allow the user to adjust the font size and contrast setting. They have text-to-speech functionality and can read aloud to the user. E-readers do not offer the same level of magnification as CCTVs.
Smartphones and Tablets- Both Apple and Android based smartphones and tablets offer a range of apps and built-in functions to help people with low vision.

Magnify, iRead and iLoupe use camera of device, and light source to magnify and illuminate text.
SightBook app digitally communicate your vision changes to your ophthalmologist by measuring your visual function with a set of near vision tests.
Mapquest app provides voice-guided directions and tells the driver when to turn.



Limitations of Low Vision Services:-


Provision of low vision services is generally not favoured by eye-care providers because of the low economic gain.
The need for low vision services is often not fully recognised, owing to inadequate data.
There is little evidence for the cost-effectiveness of low vision care interventions.
Persons with low vision are often unaware that they can be helped.
In some, there may be lack of encouragement on the part of the tester; in others, there may be poor motivation on the part of the patient.
Some patient may feel that forcing himself to see may accelerate a deterioration of his condition.
Communication and referral between eye-care, special education, rehabilitation and low vision services are often inadequate.
Planning for low vision services is inadequate."
Lid Imbrication Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/lid-imbrication-syndrome,"Lid imbrication syndrome refers to abnormality of lid apposition in which upper eyelid overrides the lower eyelid. This causes lower eyelid lashes and keratinised epithelium to rub chronically against the upper eyelid marginal tarsal conjunctiva. This leads to keratinisation of the upper eyelid margin and metaplasia of the distal tarsal conjunctiva. The resulting abnormal distal superior palpebral surface, in turn, irritates the underlying corneal surface on blinking and prohibits normal replenishment of the tear film. There are symptoms of dryness due to poor tear film being produced by disruption in tear film mechanics. It may lead to persistent corneal epithelial defects.
This condition as a cause of chronic conjunctivitis was initially described by Karesh and others (1993). This disorder may have some overlap with floppy eyelid syndrome.
Because the upper eyelid overlies the lower eyelid, visualisation of eyelid apposition during closure of eyes may be difficult, and hence, this disorder may be missed. Many patients may be misdiagnosed as a case of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome).","Lid imbrication syndrome may present with symptoms such as

Irritation of eyes.
Foreign body sensation.
Burning of eyes.
Symptoms of dryness of eyes.
Persistent corneal epithelial defects.
Overriding upper eyelid on the lower eyelid.","Lid imbrication syndrome is an idiopathic eyelid mal-position disorder and is characterized by upper eyelid overriding the lower eyelid.
Lid imbrication syndrome may be seen as

Acquired condition: When acquired, it is commonly associated with floppy eyelid syndrome.
Congenital condition: Congenital occurrence is very rare.
Post-surgical condition: Occasionally, it may follow lower eyelid tarsal strip surgery.

Closure of the eyelids is primarily is a function of the upper eyelid, with the lower lid exhibiting very little upward movement during closure of the eyes. As a result, many patients tolerate lower eyelid retraction with minimal symptoms, if the upper lid function is normal.
Lid imbrication syndrome causes ocular surface problems through the mechanical rubbing of eyelashes against the conjunctival and corneal surfaces. It is not only the trauma of the eyelashes rubbing, but also the induced chronic low grade inflammation which contributes. It further exacerbates the disease process.","Diagnosis of lid imbrication syndrome is primarily clinical.
On physical examination of the eyes, the condition is best evaluated by having the patient tilt head back and then observing from beneath with a penlight whether the upper eyelid overrides the lower or not. Many patients have gelatinous thickening of the upper eyelid tarsal marginal conjunctiva.
Vital staining: Topical rose bengal or lissamine green staining may be used to diagnose lid imbrications. These stain the tarsal conjunctiva along the upper eyelid margin. The severity of staining correlates to the severity of symptoms.
In addition to upper eyelid laxity, some patients have concomitant lower eyelid laxity without ectropion.

Differential diagnosis
Lid imbrication syndrome should be differentiated from

Floppy eyelid syndrome: Patients with lid imbrication syndrome alone show no predisposition to eyelid eversion and lack the rubbery, easily distensible upper eyelid tarsal plate. These patients also do not demonstrate upper tarsal giant papillary conjunctivitis. Moreover, the eyelid abnormalities are confined to the lid marginal tarsal conjunctiva. Furthermore, lid imbrication syndrome is more common in females.

However, lid imbrication syndrome has some overlap with the floppy eyelid syndrome.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical management to stabilise the ocular surface and reduce inflammation is required, but often it is important to surgically address the abnormal eyelid position.
Medical therapy

Artificial tears: Initial management consists of lubrication with artificial tears.


Surgical therapy

Horizontal tightening of upper eyelid: Horizontal tightening of upper eyelid to prevent upper tarsal and lower eyelid apposition may be tried.
Temporary tarsorrhaphy: Patients with persistent corneal epithelial defects due to lid imbrication syndrome may require temporary tarsorrhaphy to prevent the upper eyelid from overriding the lower eyelid.

Lower eyelid may be tightened, if it is also lax."
Lagophthalmos,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/lagophthalmos,"Lagophthalmos is the inability to close the eyelids completely on attempted closure. The term lagophthalmos is derived from the Greek word ‘lagos’ which means ‘hare’, since the hare was believed to sleep with its eyes open.
Incomplete closure results in

Increased evaporation of tears.
Poor tear film distribution.
Disruption of mucin layer component of tear film.
Drying of cornea.
Breakdown of ocular surface.

Lagophthalmos may be due to

Forward protrusion of eyeball.
Vertical upper or lower eyelid shortening.
Protractor orbicularis oculi muscle dysfunction.
Seventh intracranial nerve dysfunction.
Symblepharon formation (adhesion between eyeball and eyelid).

Closure of eyelids is primarily a function of the descending upper eyelid. The lower eyelid exhibits very little upward movement during closure of eyes. Because of this, many patients tolerate lower eyelid retraction with minimal or no symptoms, as long as the upper eyelid retains normal movement.
Some patients without peri-ocular abnormalities may sleep with their eyes partially open, yet very few of these people suffer symptoms of eye exposure. The majority of them are probably protected by Bell’s phenomenon (up-rolling of eyeballs on closure of eyelids). A number of patients with nocturnal lagophthalmos may have symptoms of ocular surface breakdown.
Comatose patients often exhibit lagophthalmos due to inadequate central seventh intracranial nerve tone. In addition, these patients with concomitant fifth intracranial nerve dysfunction are at particular risk for breakdown of corneal epithelium.","Patients present with symptoms such as

Foreign body sensation.
Irritation.
Burning of eyes.
Watering.
Eye infection.
Corneal ulceration.
Dry eyes.


Patient may be asymptomatic if there is corneal hypo-aesthesia.","Lagophthalmos is produced due to following three main causes

Failure of function of the orbicularis oculi muscle. This is the most common cause. It may be paralytic, because of facial intracranial nerve involving the orbicularis oculi muscle, or spastic, as is seen in thyrotoxicosis.
Excessive protrusion of the globe in the orbit. Lagophthalmos may accompany proptosis or buphthalmos (enlarged cornea due to elevated intraocular pressure in small children), in spite of normal eyelids, which fail to cover the proptosed eye.
Inadequate vertical dimension of either upper or lower eyelid. It may be structural when retraction or shortening of the eyelids results from scarring or atrophy following injury (e.g. burns) or a disease. Infants with a collodion membrane may have temporary lagophthalmos due to restrictive effect of the membrane on the eyelids.

A degree of physiologic lagophthalmos may occur normally during sleep. Functional lagophthalmos in an unconscious patient may be very problematic.","Diagnosis of lagophthalmos is primarily clinical.
Slit lamp examination by an eye specialist may show inter-palpebral punctate epithelial keratopathy, which is diagnostic of lagophthalmos or incomplete blink. Distribution of the punctate epithelial keratopathy depends upon the position of cornea during sleep in patients with nocturnal lagophthalmos.
External examination for complete eyelid closure should be done with patient gently closing the eyes.
Acute seventh intracranial nerve dysfunction, due to Bell’s palsy, trauma, or iatrogenic injury, may cause lagophthalmos. In cases with subtle orbicularis oculi muscle weakness, manual distraction of the eyelids during forced closure may expose weakness that may cause nocturnal lagophthalmos or incomplete blink.
It is important to check corneal sensation to rule out any component of fifth intracranial nerve dysfunction.
The vertical dimension of upper and lower eyelid skin must be evaluated in patients with suspected lagophthalmos. In the lower eyelids, vertical shortage will be apparent usually and will manifest as ‘sclera show’ and eyelid retraction. However, in upper eyelids the eyelid margin often rests at normal height, and only with downward distraction of the eyelid does the vertical skin shortness becomes apparent.
Function of levator palpebrae superioris muscle (during excursion of the eyelid from up to down), should be measured in all patients suspected of lagophthalmos. Patients with inadequate mobility of the upper eyelid retractors may have lagophthalmos despite a normal vertical amount of skin.
Symblepharon between the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva in superior fornix may also limit downward excursion of the upper eyelid thereby causing lagophthalmos.
Globe protrusion increases the amount of eyelid excursion necessary to cover the cornea fully during closure of eyes. Lagophthalmos associated with proptosis may lead to exposure keratopathy.
Nocturnal lagophthalmos causes foreign body sensation and watering of eyes on awakening.
Comatose patients often show lagophthalmos due to inadequate tone of central seventh intracranial nerve.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
General therapy

Ocular surface lubrication: Initial symptomatic management is directed towards ocular surface lubrication. Viscous artificial tears are used.
Prevent evaporative drying: Prefabricated moisture chamber or thin polyethylene film may be applied over the eyes to reduce evaporative drying. Temporary or permanent tarsorrhaphy may be required in some cases.


Definitive therapy
Definitive treatment depends upon accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause of lagophthalmos.

Proptosis: Patients with proptosis are usually best managed by orbital decompression and repositioning of eyeball within the orbit. Patients who cannot have decompression may be helped by lid lengthening procedures in an attempt to reposition the eyelids anteriorly to the corneal apex during closure of eyes. Patients with retro-bulbar mass or haemorrhage require removal or drainage of the retro-bulbar lesion.
Lid shortening: Lagophthalmos due to trauma or iatrogenic shortening of the upper eyelids usually require reconstructive soft tissue surgery.
Inadequate vertical skin: Lagophthalmos due to inadequate vertical skin requires replacement with skin flaps or grafts.
Symblepharon: Lagophthalmos due to eyelid-globe adhesion by symblepharon are treated by releasing the symblepharon and reconstructing the appropriate fornix (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) with mucous membrane grafting.
Paralysis of orbicularis oculi muscle: Measures to reduce evaporation and increase lubrication may be sufficient with limited exposure keratopathy of anticipated short duration. If exposure is severe or anticipated to be long lasting, tarsorrhaphy may be done.
Lower lid retraction: Patients with paralytic lower eyelid laxity and ectropion are best managed by placing a spacer to elevate and support the lid. Spacer material may be donor sclera or fascia, autogenous ear or nasal cartilage, acellular human dermis, or mucosa from the hard palate. Hard palate mucosa has become increasingly more common for the relief of lower lid retraction."
Lead poisoning,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/lead-poisoning,"Lead poisoning is one of the most common diseases of toxic environmental origin and accounts for about 0.6% of the global burden of disease. Lead is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in the earth’s crust. It is soft, malleable, and melts at a relatively low temperature. It is easily moulded and can be combined with other metals to form alloys.
It is widely used in many products such as lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles, pigments, paints, solder, stained glass, lead crystal glassware, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, and toys and in some cosmetics and traditional medicines.
Mining, smelting, manufacturing and recycling activities, and the continued use of leaded paint, leaded gasoline, and leaded aviation fuel (in some countries) are important sources responsible for environmental contamination. Drinking water supplied through lead pipes or pipes joined with lead solder may contain lead. Widespread use of lead has resulted in to extensive environmental contamination and health problems in many parts of the world. Humans also suffer from lead intoxication through the food chain.
Lead is a cumulative toxicant (increasing in quantity in the body over many years) that affects multiple body systems (neurologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems).Young children are more susceptible to toxic effects of lead and can suffer with permanent adverse effects on their health. Adults exposed to lead are at increased risk of developing high blood pressure and kidney damage. Exposure of pregnant women to high levels of lead can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth and low birth weight and malformations.
Lead has no essential role in the human body. No safe level of lead exposure has so far been established. Even blood lead concentrations as low as 5 µg/dl may result in decreased intelligence in children, behavioural difficulties and learning problems; therefore prevention from exposure is important. The phasing-out of lead from petrol is a major international public health achievement but still global consumption of lead is increasing because of increasing demand for energy-efficient vehicles.
Lead paint can cause a long-lasting hazard to health in all age groups. Since leaded paint is a continuing source of exposure in many countries, World Health Organization (WHO), along with the United Nations Environment Programme has formed the “Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint”. Its broad objective is to promote a phase-out of the manufacture and sale of paints containing lead and eventually to eliminate the risks involved with such paints.
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC), Government of India has passed a notification in November 2016 as “Regulation on Lead contents in Household and Decorative Paints Rules, 2016"" and has prohibited manufacture, trade, import as well as export of household and decorative paints containing lead or lead compounds in excess of 90 parts per million (ppm). Efforts should be made to create public awareness about precautionary measures to be taken to prevent lead poisoning.","Most individuals when exposed to lower levels of lead show no symptoms. When symptoms of lead poisoning appear they are non specific and cannot be differentiated. Lead can seriously affect health of children.
Symptoms may be related to gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, metallic taste. The combination of recurrent or intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation is commonly known as lead colic and should raise the suspicion of lead poisoning.
Central nervous system-Lead affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural changes such as reduced attention span and increased antisocial behaviour, poor concentration, headache, fatigue, malaise, language and speech delay. High levels of exposure can cause ataxia, seizure, coma even death.
Children who survive severe lead poisoning may be left with mental retardation and behavioural disorders.
The neurological and behavioural effects of lead are irreversible.
Musculoskeletal - Muscle and joint pain (chronic)
Other chronic effects -Short stature, weight loss, weakness

Physical examination –

Signs of increased intracranial pressure, lead lines in teeth, hypertension (high blood pressure) may be present.
Studies have shown that blood lead levels as low as 5ug/dL may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, premature birth, stillbirth, birth defects, and decreased intellect and/or behavior problems in the child.","Lead is a heavy metal with a bluish-grey colour. It has a low melting point, and can be combined with other metals to form alloys. It is widely used in products such as pipes; storage batteries; pigments and paints; glazes; vinyl products; weights, shot and ammunition; cable covers; and radiation shielding.
Lead used for these purposes come from mined ores (primary) or from recycled scrap metal or batteries (secondary). Today, most of the lead in global commerce is secondary and is obtained from recycling lead-acid batteries. Improper recycling of used lead batteries causes environmental pollution and health damage.
People can get exposure to lead mainly through inhalation and ingestion.

Inhalation of lead particles generated by burning materials containing lead, for example, during smelting, recycling, stripping leaded paint, and using leaded gasoline or leaded aviation fuel; and air pollution by smoke arising from the open burning of waste and can transport lead for long distances.
Ingestion of lead-contaminated dust, water (from leaded pipes), and food (from lead-glazed or lead-soldered containers), food chain.

The use of some traditional cosmetics and medicines can also result in lead exposure.
Young children have a higher risk for exposure because they have frequent hand-to-mouth activity, and they absorb lead more easily than do adults.
Toys are important source of children’s exposure to lead. Lead is a problem in toys for two reasons: (a) the toy may be painted with leaded paint; and (b) the toy itself is made of lead.
Children who work as scavengers, street vendors, car repairers and ship dismantlers are at increased risk of lead poisoning. (These children may also suffer from nutritional deficiencies, which further enhances the adverse effects and increases the absorption of lead).
An enormous amount of electronic waste is generated each year worldwide and large numbers of workers involved in separating lead, mercury and other metals from the waste for recovery and recycling are exposed to lead.
Lead stored in bones is released into blood during pregnancy and becomes a source of exposure to the developing foetus. Pica during pregnancy can cause maternal and fetal exposure to lead.
Workers (in industries that use lead) can bring home lead-laden dust on their clothes, shoes and vehicles, resulting in contaminated dust in their homes can cause lead poisoning in the spouses and children.
Lead paint that is peeling, chipping, chalking or cracked is a health hazard.","Symptoms of lead poisoning are not specific. The diagnosis of lead poisoning can be suspected if possible source of exposure to lead is found during routine questions such as peeling paint in old housings combined with such behavior in children as pica, chewing on surfaces, and placing nonfood items in the mouth or proximity to open burning of waste or recycling of car batteries. Symptoms may be absent in spite of significant poisoning. Routine assessment of nutritional and developmental milestones is performed in children.
Environmental investigation is carried out to identify potential sources of lead exposure.
Laboratory investigation- 

Blood lead level (BLL)- Human exposure is usually assessed through the measurement of lead in blood.
Haematology - Hypochromic anaemia, red blood cells with basophilic stippling, elevated protoporphyrin levels (erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) or zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP)
Liver Function test shows elevated transaminase levels (acute poisoning),
Other -Hyperuricaemia, hypocalcaemia
Urine -Proteinuria, glucosuria and aminoaciduria (acute poisoning)

Radiological investigation shows lead lines in the metaphyses of long bones (chronic poisoning).","Medical interventions and treatments vary depending on the confirmed blood lead level. Simply avoiding exposure to lead might be enough to reduce low levels of lead in blood.
In more severe cases chelation therapy is recommended. In this treatment a medication given by mouth / injection binds with the lead so that it's excreted in urine. (While chelating agents can bind to lead in blood, they are ineffective in removing lead from the deep bone stores).
Nutritional counseling is given about intake of foods containing calcium, iron and vitamin C. (Adequate iron is required to decrease lead absorption. Foods high in calcium will help to maintain adequate calcium bone stores and lead will not get stored in bones. Vitamin C is needed for the absorption of iron. Children with empty stomach absorb more lead than children with full stomachs)."
lactose intolerance,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/lactose-intolerance,"Lactose intolerance is a condition in which some persons have digestive symptoms such as bloating, flatulence and diarrhea after consumption of foods and drinks that contain lactose. Lactose is a sugar that is naturally found in milk and milk products (such as cheese or ice cream).
The digestive symptoms of lactose intolerance are caused by lactose malabsorption. Lactose malabsorption occurs when small intestines cannot digest the lactose present in milk and milk products due to deficiency or absence of lactase enzyme.
Congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia, is a disorder in which infants are unable to break down lactose in breast milk or formula milk. This form oflactose intoleranceresults in severe diarrhea. Lactose intolerancein adulthood is caused by reduced production of lactase after infancy (lactase nonpersistence).
Most people with lactose intolerance can tolerate some amount of lactose without having symptoms. Different people can tolerate different amounts of lactose before having symptoms. As much as 60 percent of the world's population is unable to process the lactose in animal milk.
Lactose intolerance is different from milk allergy, as milk allergy is an immune system disorder.","Symptoms of lactose intolerance may be noticed within a few hours after ingestion of milk or milk products or other foods that contain lactose. Symptoms usually appear with in 30 minutes to two hours after lactose intake.These symptoms may include-

Bloating
Flatulence
Diarrhea
Nausea
Vomiting
Pain in abdomen
stomach “growling” or rumbling sounds
Feeling sick
Urgency with bowel movements","Normally lactose (milk sugar) breaks down by lactase in the small intestine in to two simple sugars glucose and galactose, which are absorbed into the bloodstream through the intestinal lining. Lactase is an enzyme which helps in the process of digestion of lactose.
When the small intestine has deficient or low levels of lactase enzymes, lactose is not properly digested and the undigested lactose passes into the colon (large intestine).Bacteria present in the colon break down the lactose and create fluid and gas. In some people, this extra fluid and gas causes symptoms of lactose intolerance.
Lactase deficiency may be of two types:
(i)Primary lactase deficiency: In this type of lactase deficiency genes play an important role, such as:

Congenital lactase deficiency: It is a rare condition, in this the small intestine makes little or no lactase since birth. This form oflactose intoleranceresults in severe diarrhea.
Lactase non-persistence:In this, the small intestine makes less lactase after infancy and it gets lower with age. Symptoms of lactose intolerance may not begin until later childhood, the teen years, or early adulthood.

(ii)Secondary lactase deficiency: As not all cases of lactose intolerance are genetic, the following conditions can also lead to lactose intolerance:

Injury to the small intestine due to infectious disease or other conditions may cause lactose intolerance such as Rotavirus and Giardia infections. Secondary lactase deficiency can also occur in celiac disease, Crohn’s disease.
Premature birth: In premature babies the small intestine may not make enough lactase for a short duration of time after birth but as baby gets older the small intestine usually makes more lactase.

(iii)Acquired Lactase Deficiency:Many individuals acquire lactose intolerance as they get older. This condition is due to a normal decline in the amount of the enzyme lactase present in the small intestine as age increases.","For diagnosis of lactose intolerance, health care provider may ask about symptoms, family and medical history, eating habits and do physical examination.
Other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases can cause symptoms similar to those of lactose intolerance. Health care provider may ask the person to stop eating and drinking milk and milk products for a period of time to see if the symptoms are still present there or not. If symptoms are still there, additional tests may be done.
Hydrogen breath test
For this test, person drinks a liquid that contains a known amount of lactose. Every 30 minutes over a few hours, person will breathe into a balloon-type container that measures the amount of hydrogen in your breath. If breath hydrogen levels and symptoms increase during the test, doctor may diagnose lactose intolerance.","Symptoms of lactose intolerance can be managed by change in diet; tolimit or avoid foods and drinks that contain lactose such as milk and milk products. Some persons can manage their symptoms by just limiting the intake of lactose while others may need to avoid lactose altogether.
Treatments depend on thecause of lactose intolerance. If lactose intolerance is caused by lactase non persistence or congenital lactase deficiencychange in diet can manage the symptoms.
Some milk and milk products can be tolerated if taken in a following way:

drink small amounts of milk at a time and have it with meals,
add milk and milk products to your diet a little at a time and see how you feel,
try eating yogurt and hard cheeses, like cheddar or Swiss, which are lower in lactose than other milk products,
use lactase productsto help digest the lactose in milk and milk products. Lactase products are tablets or drops that contain lactase, theenzymethat breaks down lactose. Some people, such as young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women, may not be able to use them.
Use of lactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products

If an individual is restricting their milk/ dairy intake it is important to ensure adequate supplementation of calcium and vitamin D in the diet. This is especially important for pediatric patients and women.
Following sources are not containing lactose bur are rich sources of calcium.

fish with soft bones, such as canned salmon or sardines
broccoli and leafy green vegetables
oranges
almonds, Brazil nuts, and dried beans
tofu
products with labels that show they have added calcium, such as some cereals, fruit juices, and soy milk

Ingredients can be checked on packaged foods to see if the product contains lactose. The following words mean that the product contains lactose:

milk
lactose
whey
curds
milk by-products
dry milk solids
nonfat dry milk powder

If lactose intolerance is caused by an injury/infection to small intestine, it can be treated accordingly. While in premature babies if they are lactose intolerant, the condition usually improves without treatment as the baby gets older."
Measles(Khasra),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/measles-khasra,"Measles is an acute and highly infectious disease of childhood, transmitted by droplets from nose, mouth or throat. It is caused by viruses.  Measles is characterised by fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms like cough and cold (coryza). The rash of measles is typical.

Malaria,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/malaria,"Malaria is a disease having symptoms of recurrent fever with chill and headache. After onset of fever it subsides after sometimes and again reoccurs. In severe cases it can progress to coma or even death. It is caused by parasites known as Plasmodium. It commences with the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes which carries this parasite.
The disease is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions around the equator, including much of Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In India the disease occurs throughout the year across the country. However, it is more prevalent during and after the rainy season due to mosquito breeding.
According to World Health Organization (WHO), India contributes 77% of the total malaria cases in Southeast Asia. The disease is mainly prevalent in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Goa, Southern Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and in northeastern states.

Fever, headache, vomiting and other flu-like symptoms, (The fever occurs in four-to-eight hour cycles.)
The parasite infects and destroys red blood cells resulting in fatigue, fits/convulsions and loss of consciousness.

If the symptoms of malaria are not identified on time, the result can be fatal.","Malaria parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium. In humans, malaria is caused by P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax. The life cycle of parasite completes in mosquitoes and human.
DISEASE PROCESS:
Malaria is caused by parasites known as Plasmodium This parasite is generally spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes, known as night-biting mosquitoes, as it generally bites between dusk and dawn. If a mosquito bites a person infected with malaria, it can also become infected and spread the parasite on to others. During the bite of female mosquitoes, the half matured parasite transmits from the saliva of the mosquitoes into the small blood vessels (circulatory system) of the human through a special body part of the mosquitoes called as Proboscis. The parasite enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver. In the blood, the parasites travel to the liver cell and there they mature and reproduce. The infection develops in the liver before re-entering the bloodstream and invading the red blood cells. The parasites grow and multiply in the red blood cells. At regular intervals, the infected blood cells burst, releasing more parasites into the blood. Infected blood cells usually burst every 48 to 72 hours. Each time they burst, one will have a bout of fever, chills and sweating.
Man develops disease after 10 to 14 days (incubation period) of being bitten by an infective mosquito. Uninfected female Anopheles if bite does not cause Malaria.","Malaria can be diagnosed by the doctor based on the patient’s history (fever with chill and rigor) followed by the clinical assessment (enlargement of liver and spleen).
Microscopic examination:
The most preferred and reliable diagnosis of malaria is microscopic examination of blood films as all of the four major parasite species can be distinguished easily.
Immuno chromatographic test:
This is also called as Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test. This test uses finger-stick and a drop of venous blood. The reading can be assessed visually as the presence of colored strips on the dipstick. It takes a total of 15–20 minutes to complete the procedure.
Molecular methods:
Molecular methods are available such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It is more accurate than microscopy.","The treatment chosen will depend upon whether the patient has vivax malaria or falciparum malaria as diagnosed by the blood test, age of the patient, the pregnancy status of the female patient and location of the patient.

Seizures or fits
Being unable to tolerate bright light (photophobia) – this is less common in young children
A stiff neck – also less common in young children
A rapid breathing rate","Meningitis is typically caused by an infection with microorganisms. Most infections are due to viruses with bacteria, fungi, and protozoa being the next most common causes.

Broadly, there are five types of meningitis :

Bacterial meningitis, which is caused by bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcuspneumoniaeand spread through close contact. It can be life threatening, so immediate medical attention is recommended.
Viral meningitis, which is caused by viruses that can be spread through coughing, sneezing and poor hygiene.
Parasitic meningitis,Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a very rare form of parasitic meningitis that causes a fatal brain infection. 
Fungal meningitis, Fungal meningitis is rare and is usually carried by blood to the meninges. Although anyone can get fungal meningitis, people with weak immune system, like those suffering fromAIDS, diabetes or cancer, are at a higher risk.

Non infectious meningitis,Non–infectious meningitis does not spread from person to person but can be caused by:

1)Cancers
2)Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus)
3)Certain drugs
4)Head injury
5)Brain surgery","Diagnostic tests for meningitis include:

Blood test – to check for the presence of bacteria or viruses that can cause meningitis
Lumbar puncture – where a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is taken from the base of the spine and checked for the presence of bacteria or viruses
Computerized tomography (CT) scan – if there are any other suspected problems, such as damage to the brain
Chest X-ray to look for signs of infection

NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose you should consult your physician.","Meningitis is a life-threatening disease and has a high mortality rate if untreated.

Bacterial meningitis:
Antibiotics like Cephalosporins have shown good results. Chloramphenicol, either alone or in combination with ampicillin, however, appears to work equally well.

Viral meningitis:
Viral meningitis tends to run a more benign course than bacterial meningitis. It only requires supportive therapy as most viruses responsible for causing meningitis are not amenable to specific treatment.

Fungal meningitis:
Fungal meningitis, such as cryptococcal or Coccidioides meningitis, is treated with long courses of high dose antifungals, such as amphotericin B and flucytosine.

Non infectious meningitis:
Non infectious meningitis may be treated with cortisone medications. In some cases, treatment may not be required and the condition can resolve on its own.

Migraine,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/migraine,"Migraine is a neurological disorder often described as intense pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head.Typically the headache is unilateral (affecting one half of the head) and pulsating in nature, lasting from 2 to 72 hours.
Migraines are believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors . Migraines typically present with self-limited, recurrent severe headache associated with autonomic symptoms.","Symptoms of migraine can be divided into stages. There are five distinct stages of migraine, though not everyone goes through all the stages:

'Prodromal' (pre-headache) stage: Some people experience changes in mood, energy levels, behaviour and appetite, and sometimes aches and pains several hours or days before an attack.
Aura: Some people experience a sensation, or aura, just before their migraine starts. Symptoms of aura include flashes of light or blind spots, difficulty focusing, and seeing things as if they are looking through a broken mirror. This stage normally lasts around 15 minutes to an hour.
Headache stage: This is usually a pulsating or throbbing pain on one side of the head. It is associated with nausea or vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to bright light and loud sounds, with a strong desire to lie down in a darkened room. This stage lasts for four to 72 hours.
Resolution stage: Most attacks gradually fade away. Some people find the headache stops suddenly after they have been sick. Sleep often relieves the symptoms.
'Postdromal' or recovery phase: There may be a stage of exhaustion and weakness afterwards. Other symptoms can also occur during a migraine. These include:

Poor concentration
Sweating
Feeling very hot or very cold
Abdominal pain
A frequent need to urinate","Exact cause of migraine is still not known. Though various trigger factors are associated with physiological factors, such as:

Stress
Hunger
Fatigue

Other hormonal influences, such as menarche (First menstrual cycle), oral contraceptive use,pregnancy, peri menopause and menopause, also play an important role. These hormonal influences seem to play a greater role in migraine without aura.
Dietary triggers include:

Eating less food (dieting)
Delayed or irregular meals
Dehydration
Alcohol
Food containing high content of tyramine (for instance: dairy,meat,poultry and fish products)
Caffeine products, such as tea and coffee
Specific foods such as chocolate, citrus fruit or cheese
Environmental factors include:
Bright light
Smoke
Crowded atmosphere
Loud noise
Changes in climate, such as changes in humidity or very cold temperature
Flickering screen on television or computer screen","The diagnosis of migraine is based on signs and symptoms.
Imaging tests are occasionally performed to exclude other causes of headaches.
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose you should consult your physician.","There is currently no cure for migraines. Pain killers like paracetamol and aspirin are very effective to combat migraine.Triptans such as sumatriptan (imitrex), rizatriptan (maxalt) are also effective inrelieving the pain and other symptoms that are associated with migraines."
Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/cardio-vascular/heart/myocardial-infarction-heart-attack,"Myocardial Infarction(MI) also known as heart attack is one of the most common non-communicable diseases/ chronic diseases, which cannot be transmitted from person to person. It gradually progresses and affects the blood supply to heart.
A myocardial infarction is a serious medical emergency that occurs due to the blockage of one of the arteries which is supplying blood to the heart . Due to which ,lack of oxygen to heart causes characteristic chest pain and death of myocardial tissue.","Generally, symptoms appear gradually. Chest pain is the most common symptom of acute myocardial infarction.
It is often associated with

Sensation of tightness
Pressure
Squeezing

Pain generally radiates to the left arm, but may also radiate to the lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and epigastrium , where it may mimic heartburn.
Levine's sign, in which the patient localizes the chest pain by clenching his fist over the sternum, has been thought to be predictive of cardiac chest pain.
Others symptoms include:

Shortness of breath
Anxiety
Coughing
Wheezing","Rate of heart attacks is generally higher with intense exertion, it can also be due to psychological stress or physical exertion.
Risk factors associated with MI are:

Age: With the increasing age chances of heart attack also increases.
Gender: Men are more at risk than women.
Diabetes mellitus(type 1 or 2)
High blood pressure.
Dyslipidemia / hypercholesterolemia (abnormal levels of lipoproteins in the blood), particularly high low-density lipoprotein, low high-density lipoprotein and high triglycerides.
Tobacco smoking, including passive smoking.
Family history of heart disease or myocardial infarction particularly if one has a first-degree relative (father, brother, mother, sister).
Lack of physical activity.
Alcohol — Studies show that prolonged exposure to high quantities of alcohol can increase the risk of heart attack.
Oral contraceptive pill – Women who use combined oral contraceptive pills are at an increased risk of myocardial infarction, especially in the presence of other risk factors, such as smoking.","According to the WHO criteria as revised in 2000, a cardiac troponin rise accompanied by either typical symptoms, pathological Q waves, ST elevation or depression or coronary intervention are diagnostic of MI.
Physical examination
The appearance of patients may vary according to the symptoms. A cold and pale skin is common and points to vasoconstriction. Some patients have low-grade fever (38–39 °C). Blood pressure may be elevated or decreased, and the pulse can become irregular.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
12-lead electrocardiogram showing ST-segment elevation in I and V1-V5 with reciprocal changes (blue) in the inferior leads, indicative of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups:

Those with ST segment elevation or new bundle branch block
Those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion (suspicious for ischemia), and
Those with so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG. A normal ECG does not rule out acute myocardial infarction.

Errors in interpretation are relatively common, and the failure to identify high risk features has a negative effect on the quality of patient care.
Cardiac markers
Cardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream. The markers most widely used in detection of MI are the enzyme creatine kinase and cardiac troponins T and I as they are more specific for myocardial injury. The cardiac troponins T and I which are released within 4–6 hours of an attack of MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, have nearly complete tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires two out of three components (history, ECG, and enzymes). When damage to the heart occurs, levels of cardiac markers rise over time.
Angiography
To restore blood flow, coronary angiography can be performed. A catheter is inserted into an artery (usually the femoral artery) and pushed to the vessels supplying the heart. A radio-opaque dye is administered through the catheter and a sequence of x-rays (fluoroscopy) is performed. Obstructed or narrowed arteries can be identified, and angioplasty applied as a therapeutic measure. Angioplasty requires extensive skill, especially in emergency settings. It is performed by a physician trained in interventional cardiology.
Exercise stress test
Measures heart rate while patient walks on a treadmill. This helps to determine how well heart is working when it has to pump more blood.
Doppler test
A Doppler test uses reflected sound waves to see how blood flows through a blood vessel. It helps doctors evaluate blood flow through major arteries and veins, such as those of the arms, legs, and neck. It can show blocked or reduced blood flow through narrowing in the major arteries of the neck that may cause infarction.
NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose you should consult your physician.","Oxygen and aspirin are usually administered as soon as possible.
Anti platelets agents:
Drugs like aspirin has been shown to markedly reduce mortality and thus should be taken as soon as possible in those without an allergy to it.
Coronary angioplasty:
In coronary angioplasty, a tiny tube known as a catheter, with a sausage-shaped balloon at the end, is put into a large artery of groin or arm. The catheter is passed through blood vessels and up to heart, over a fine guide wire, using X-rays to guide it, before being moved into the narrowed section of coronary artery. Once in position, the balloon is inflated inside the narrowed part of the artery to open it wide. A stent (flexible metal mesh) is usually inserted into the artery to help keep it open afterwards.
Thrombolysis:
Thrombolysis involves giving injections which contain thrombolytics. Thrombolytics target and destroy a substance called fibrin. Fibrin is a tough protein that makes up blood clots by acting like a sort of fibre mesh that hardens around the blood. Thrombolytic medications used in the treatment of heart attacks include reteplase, alteplase and streptokinase.

Microcephaly,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/paediatric/microcephaly,"Microcephaly is a condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth. Microcephaly is neonatal malformation defined as a head size much smaller compared with other babies of the same age and sex. Microcephaly can occur as an isolated condition, or it can occur in combination with other major birth defects.
According to World Health Organization (WHO), microcephaly is a rare condition. One baby in several thousand is born with microcephaly.
Brazil has reported an unusual, sudden increase in babies born with microcephaly since May 2015. Brazilian Live Birth Information System (SINASC) reported the prevalence of microcephaly in Brazilian newborns as 5.5 cases/100,000 live births and 5.7 cases /100,000 live births in 2000 and 2010 respectively. Over the last three months of 2015, it went up to 99.7 per 100.000 live birthsa.
Recently a base line estimate of birth prevalence of microcephaly affected births (total number of babies including both live born and stillborn with microcephaly per 10 000 births) in India was determined after a systematic review and meta-analysis of several studies. The pooled birth prevalence of microcephaly was shown as 2.30 per 10 000 births among 97155 birthsb.
Babies born with micocephaly often have smaller brains which have not developed properly. Other symptoms like convulsions, physical and learning disabilities start to appear as child grows older.
There are no specific tests to determine microcephaly during fetal life, but ultrasound scans in the third trimester of pregnancy can be used to identify the problem. The most reliable method to diagnose the microcephaly in new born is to measure head circumference 24 hours after birth, compare the value with WHO growth standards and continue to monitor the rate of head growth in early infancy.","Babies with microcephaly can have different types of symptoms depending upon the severity of microcephaly. Some children with microcephaly will develop entirely normally. Many babies born with microcephaly may show no other symptoms at birth but go on to develop:

Epilepsy (Seizures)
Delay with developmental milestones like head holding, sitting, standing, walking, or others.
Feeding problems- difficulty in swallowing
Problems with speech
Learning disabilities (decreased ability to learn and function in daily life)
Cerebral palsy (problems with movement and balance)
Hearing loss
Vision problems","There are various factors which cause microcephaly in newborns, but often cause remains unknown. The most common causes include following:

Genetic abnormalities like Down syndrome,
Infections during pregnancy such as toxoplasmosis (caused by a parasite found in undercooked meat), rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus and HIV,
Maternal exposure to toxic substances like arsenic and mercury, alcohol, radiation and smoking,
Severe malnutrition during fetal life,
Interruption of the blood supply to the babies brain (perinatal asphyxia),
There is surge in microcephaly in babies born to mothers suffered from zika virus infection during pregnancy; researchers are studying the potential link between the two.","During the pregnancy:
According to WHO early diagnosis of microcephaly can be done by fetal ultrasound. Ultrasounds should be done at the end of the second trimester, around 28 weeks, or in the third trimester of pregnancy.
In fetuses with head circumference two standard deviations below the mean for gestational age, microcephaly should be suspected.
After child birth:
Head circumference of newborn babies should be measured when newborn baby is at least 24 hours oldand compared with WHO growth standards in relation to the gestational age, sex, weight and length of the baby.
The measurement value for microcephaly is usually less than two standard deviations (2SDs) below the average. Severe microcephaly is defined as a head circumference less than three standard deviations (3SDs) below the average for babies of the same age and sex. (This means the baby’s head is extremely small compared to babies of the same age and sex.)
Suspected cases should be reviewed by a pediatrician, brain imaging scans such as computed tomography scan (CT scan), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be done. Their head circumference should be measured at monthly intervals in early infancy and compared with growth standards.
Doctors should also test for known causes of microcephaly.","There is no standard treatment for microcephaly. Sometimes medications are needed to treat seizures or other symptoms.

A team of persons of different discipline may help in assessment and care of babies and children with microcephaly.

Family counseling and psychological support for parents should be integral part of the case management."
Mooren's Ulcer,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/mooren-s-ulcer,"Mooren’s Ulcer is a painful, progressive, and chronic disease of the cornea, which often is bilateral and may cause severe vision loss or even loss of the eye. It is characterised by painful peripheral corneal ulceration of unknown aetiology. The disease generally begins with intense limbal inflammation and swelling in episclera and conjunctiva. Corneal changes begin 2- 3mm from the limbus as grey swelling that rapidly furrows. It affects superficial one- third of cornea and then it progresses circumferentially and centrally. There is usually infiltration and undermining of the leading edge of the circumferential peri-limbal ulceration. The bed of the furrow becomes vascularised with vessels advancing into the base of the undermined edges. The central edges of the ulcer can develop an overhanging edge extending from limbus into the ulcer bed, with or without opacification and neovascularisation. Neovascularisation may occur up to the advancing edge of the ulcer but not beyond it. Tissue destruction and ulceration of the cornea is initially confined to the periphery, but it may progress in some patients to involve the entire cornea. Destruction of the cornea generally affects stromal tissue only, leaving behind an intact epithelium and endothelium. The ulcers are crescent- shaped and may leave behind either an opaque oedematous cornea or is replaced with a thin fibro-vascular membrane. It does not affect underlying Descemet’s membrane. There is no associated scleral inflammation. Intense pain is a hallmark of Mooren’s ulcer, which is generally lacking in other peripheral ulcerative keratitis. The disease may be refractory to all forms of available therapy.
Bowman (1849) first described what we now call Mooren’s ulcer of the cornea (also known as chronic serpiginous ulcer and ulcus rodens). Mooren’s ulcer as a clinical entity was first described in detail by Mooren (1867).
Wood and Kaufman (1971) postulated that there are two distinct populations of patients with Mooren’s ulcer. These two clinical types of primary Mooren’s ulcer are:

Type I: The limited type is typically unilateral, not associated with significant pain, and occurs in older patients (fourth decade and older). It is more responsive to local medical and surgical therapy.
Type II: Relentless, progressive type is more resistant to systemic immune-suppression. It is painful, bilateral and causes relentless, progressive destruction of the cornea, usually in younger individuals (third decade), many of whom are of African descent. It may progress to corneal perforation.

However, the categorisation described by Wood and Kaufman has been refuted by Lewallen S and Courtright P (1990).","Mooren’s ulcer may produce symptoms such as:

Severe ocular pain.
Watering.
Foreign body sensation.
Redness.
Photophobia.
Blurring of vision.","The cause of Mooren’s ulcer is unknown, but evidence suggests an autoimmune basis. Supportive evidence includes:

Presence of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the conjunctiva adjacent to the ulcer.
Serum of patients shows circulating antibodies to conjunctival and corneal epithelium.
Elevation of serum levels of immunogobulin (Ig) like IgA, IgG and IgM and lymphocytes sensitised to saline- soluble corneal antigen.
Increased antibody levels to a cornea- specific stromal protein antigen.
Increased helper T cell to suppressor T cell ratio.
Favourable response to immunosuppressive agents in some patients.
Presence of Calgranulin C, a unique cornea associated protein that is present in the cornea and is the target of auto-antibodies from patients with Mooren’s ulcer. This calcium- binding protein is identical to a neutrophil protein found on the surface of filarial nematodes. Recognition of this complex on a filarial nematode is suspected to lead to autoimmunity to the cornea in patients with persistent parasitic infection resulting in Mooren’s ulcer.

Mooren’s ulcer may represent a final common pathway to a variety of insults to the cornea in susceptible patients. Trauma or infection may alter normal corneal antigens, which may lead to an autoimmune response. The cornea is damaged further, liberating altered corneal antigens that aggravate and perpetuate the process until the corneal stroma is completely destroyed.
Certain conditions may be associated with Mooren’s ulcer:

Alkali injuries.
Trauma.
Herpes simplex infection.
Herpes zoster infection.
Parasitic infections.
Cataract surgery.
Corneal surgery.

In the past, Mooren’s ulcer has been related to:

Malnutrition.
Metabolic disorder.
Trophic disturbances involving the trigeminal cranial nerve.
Deficiency of vitamin B1.

Some patients have been identified who have an underlying chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus infection. This infection should be excluded because it alters therapy and the potential outcome of treatment.
The majority of the cases, however, appear to be idiopathic and the disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion.","By definition, primary Mooren’s ulcer is not associated with any systemic abnormality, except for the occasional association with hepatitis C. It is not associated with scleritis, which distinguishes it from other more common types of peripheral ulcerative keratitis associated with collagen vascular disease. Patients having other systemic disease including leukaemia, pyoderma gangrenosum and syphilis may also develop peripheral ulcerative keratitis. This classic idiopathic variety may manifest as either type I or type II.
A secondary Mooren’s ulcer like peripheral ulcerative keratitis may occur following other types of corneal inflammation, including trauma, cataract surgery, herpes simplex, herpes zoster and chemical injury with alkalis. Although these are not diagnostic of true Mooren’s ulcer, they do support the involvement of an altered auto-antigen pathogenic mechanism. This is often unilateral and behaves clinically like type I.
A small group of patients with aggressive disease progression are seropositive for hepatitis C.
Diagnosis of Mooren’s ulcer depends upon medical history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Laboratory investigations are required to exclude other systemic diseases.
Clinical features:
Mooren’s ulcer is characterised by a progressive, crescentic, peripheral corneal ulceration which is slightly towards the center from the corneoscleral limbus. It is associated with a characteristic undermined overhanging edge. It typically progresses with an anterior, stromal, yellow- white infiltrate at the advancing margin. An overlying epithelial defect then may develop. The ulcer progresses both circumferentially and centrally. Progressive stromal melting affects first the deeper and subsequently the anterior stroma. Following stromal melting, a re-epithelialised, conjunctivalised, scarred and thinned cornea remains. Patients with minimal stroma left may be predisposed to perforation either spontaneously or following minimal trauma.
In aggressive form of Mooren’s ulcer, inflammation may affect the entire cornea and perilimbal tissue. The cornea may perforate. It may have associated cataract, secondary glaucoma and uveitis.
Chronic Mooren’s ulcer ultimately results in central area of hazy stromal tissue with severe peripheral thinning. There is no scleral involvement, but associated conjunctival and episcleral inflammation may be present. There is no lucid interval (clear zone between ulcer and limbus). Scarring is common and it may be associated with irregular corneal astigmatism.
Corneal topography: Corneal topography shows peripheral steepening and severe irregular corneal astigmatism.

Srinivasan and colleagues (2007) described three patterns of corneal ulceration:

Partial peripheral ulceration: Partial peripheral ulceration may be sub-divided into nasal, temporal, superior and inferior ulceration. Nasal and temporal involvement is more common.
Complete peripheral ulceration: In complete peripheral ulceration, the disease encompasses the corneal periphery, leaving behind a central island of cornea that is often opacified.
Total corneal ulceration: In total corneal ulceration, the stroma is completely replaced with a fibro-vascular membrane.

Watson and colleagues (1997) classified the disease into three types based on clinical features, anterior segment fluorescein angiographic findings, and treatment response:

Unilateral Mooren’s ulceration: Unilateral Mooren’s ulceration is excessively painful and occurs in elderly. Affected eyes are red but inflammation does not extend beyond 3mm from the limbus. Ulceration extends around the globe and often leaves an opaque central cornea. The central corneal stroma is eventually removed. Anterior segment fluorescein angiography shows venular occlusion of local episcleral and conjunctival blood vessels along with disruption of the limbal arcade and vascular leakage from deep vessels at the limbus and base of the ulcer. In addition, vaso- obliteration of superficial vascular networks is characteristic of unilateral Mooren’s ulcer.
Bilateral aggressive Mooren’s ulcer: Bilateral aggressive Mooren’s ulcer occurs in younger patients and the pain is less severe. Grey patches occur in corneal stroma about 2mm from the edge of the limbus. These grey patches then aggregate and lead to a typical Mooren’s ulcer that progress first circumferentially and then centrally. Fluorescein angiography shows vascular leakage and new vessel formation that reaches the base of the ulcer. Angiography may also show changes in episcleral vessels and blockage in addition to break-up of the limbal arcade.
Bilateral indolent Mooren’s ulcer: Bilateral indolent Mooren’s ulcer occurs in middle aged patients who exhibit corneal guttering in both eyes with little inflammation. Both eyes tend to be involved at presentation, but the disease is often more severe in one eye. Most cases are gradually progressive but some heal spontaneously. Vascular architecture is normal with the exception that new vessels may extend into the base of the ulcer.

Since Mooren’s ulcer is a clinical diagnosis, it is not necessary to conduct all investigations, if Watson’s criteria is met.
Watson’s criteria:

Crescent shaped peripheral corneal ulcer.
Extensive undermining of the central edge of the ulcer.
Corneal infiltrations along the leading edge.
Absence of scleritis.
Absence of detectable systemic disease.


Laboratory investigations include:
Blood examination: It includes complete and differential blood cell count including platelet counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
Serology: It includes measurement of rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test.
In addition, certain tests like measurement of liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, serum protein electrophoresis and urinalysis may also be required.

Pathology:
In Mooren’s ulcer, three zones of corneal involvement have been described.

Superficial stroma: Superficial stroma contains plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, neovascular elements and disrupted collagen lamellae.
Midstroma: Midstroma shows an increase in number of fibroblasts.
Deep stroma: Deep stroma is infiltrated primarily by macrophages. The epithelial basement membrane is disrupted at the leading edge and the infiltrate contains primarily neutrophils.

Conjunctiva: Conjunctival resections show mononuclear infiltrate in the substantia propria, which contains plasma cells, histiocytes and eosinophils.
The presence of tissue- fixed auto-antibodies and complement also has been reported in the epithelial basement membrane of the cornea and conjunctiva.

Differential diagnosis:
Mooren’s ulcer is a rare disease. The differential diagnosis includes other inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions causing peripheral thinning such as:

Terrien’s marginal degeneration: Terrien’s marginal degeneration is a non-inflammatory peripheral corneal thinning disorder that is usually bilateral, superior, and not associated with significant pain or inflammation unless there is an associated episcleritis or superficial scleritis. The corneal epithelium remains intact and the disease slowly progresses in circumferential manner without involving central cornea.
Pellucid marginal degeneration: Pellucid marginal degeneration causes inferior corneal thinning and irregular against-the-rule astigmatism but lacks the inflammation and pain seen in Mooren’s ulcer.
Senile furrow degeneration: Senile furrow degeneration causes thinning between the limbus and the arcus in elderly patients. However, no inflammation or vascularisation occurs.
Peripheral marginal keratitis (catarrhal ulcer): Peripheral marginal keratitis (catarrhal ulcer), seen in association with staphylococcal blepharitis, may also show peripheral infiltrates. The infiltrate is usually unilateral and is separated from the limbus by a lucid interval (a clear zone). Associated pain is not severe. The disease has a benign course, and is self- limited.
Collagen vascular diseases: Collagen vascular diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and Wegener’s granulomatosis, may also be associated with peripheral corneal infiltrates and ulcers with features similar to Mooren’s ulcer and an associated scleritis. The characteristic marginal furrows of rheumatoid arthritis are located about 1mm within the limbus and usually bilaterally in the inferior cornea. It may be superficial and nonprogressive, or it may progress to epithelial breakdown, marked stromal thinning with formation of descemetocele, and finally perforation. The marginal furrows may encircle the cornea. Occasionally, the entire superficial part of the remaining central corneal stroma may slough away.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
The objective and goal of therapy of Mooren’s ulcer is to stop the progression of the ulcerative process and promote re- epithelialisation of the ulcerated area. Symptoms of pain and photophobia and inflammatory signs of conjunctival hyperaemia and oedema generally disappear shortly after healing is complete.
Brown and Mondino (1984) suggested a stepladder approach that includes topical corticosteroids, conjunctival resection, and systemic immunosuppressives.
Medical therapy:

Topical corticosteroids: To begin with, patients with Mooren’s ulcer are treated with topical corticosteroids, as long as there is no sign or danger of imminent perforation. The frequency of topical steroids may be slowly tapered, if the ulcer heals completely. Aggressive therapy with topical corticosteroids may be effective in unilateral and bilateral non simultaneous cases, but not treated aggressively in bilateral simultaneous cases. Topical steroids must be used with extreme caution in patients having associated rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients with Mooren’s ulcer are prescribed antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection, and cycloplegics to control pain from spasm of the ciliary body.

Systemic immunosuppressives: Systemic immunosuppressives may be employed in patients with bilateral and progressive disease, and also where conjunctival excision does not result in total healing of ulcer. If healing does not occur after one or two months, immunosuppressive therapy is slowly decreased and then discontinued. If some healing is observed, the medication is continued until complete healing. The dosage of the treatment is titrated to maintain haemoglobin and blood counts. Common immunosuppressive drugs used are cyclophosphamide, azathioprine with or without steroids, and methotrexate. Some treat Mooren’s ulcer with systemic and topical cyclosporine A. The efficacy of topical cyclosporine is attributed to local depression of ocular immune-pathologic reaction.

Systemic immunosuppressives may also be used for peripheral corneal ulcers associated with collagen vascular diseases. Systemic immunosuppressive agents, including corticosteroids, have been effective in the treatment of scleritis and ulcerative keratitis. Cytotoxic agents may improve long- term survival.
Systemic immunosuppression would likely be contraindicated in a patient with chronic hepatitis C infection, so it is important to exclude it beforehand.

Interferon- α2b: Recently, an association has been reported between Mooren’s ulcer and hepatitis C infection. Some cases of bilateral ulcer that did not respond to conventional therapy showed improvement with systemic interferon- α2b for the chronic active hepatitis.
Rebetron: Rebetron is a newer treatment option. It combines interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin.
Topical lecithinated superoxide dismutase: A novel experimental therapy with topical lecithinated superoxide dismutase limited tissue destruction in patients who failed to topical corticosteroid therapy.

In addition, bandage contact lenses may reduce discomfort and promote epithelial healing. Subconjunctival heparin injections and topical collagenase inhibitors have also been used.

Surgical therapy:

Conjunctival resection: Conjunctival resection may be performed adjacent to the ulcer in patients who show incomplete or no response to topical corticosteroids. About 3mm of conjunctiva is resected from the corneoscleral limbus and adjacent to the corneal ulcer. The epithelium in the bed of ulcer and less than 0.2mm of corneal epithelium central to the ulcer are removed by simple debridement.
Cryotherapy: Cryotherapy of the conjunctiva adjacent to the affected cornea. It gives similar results as are obtained with conjunctival excision.
Tissue adhesives (isobutyl- cyanoacrylate): Tissue adhesives (isobutyl- cyanoacrylate) may be applied if the corneal perforation is less than 1mm in size. There may be an arrest of ulceration if the application is done at an early stage before corneal perforation. The adhesive rapidly polymerises and becomes a solid adhesive on contact with water.
Keratoplasty: Keratoplasty may be required when the corneal perforation is too large for tissue adhesive to seal and prevent the leak.

- Patch graft: Patch graft may range from a tapered plug of corneal tissue to a peripheral penetrating keratoplasty. A small piece of corneal tissue is crafted into a tapering plug to fill the defect. The margins of the perforation site are cleaned of any necrotic material and epithelial tissue.
-Partial penetrating keratoplasty: Partial penetrating keratoplasty may be performed in cases with larger peripheral perforations.
-Penetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty shows poor results and has been described for patients with healed Mooren’s ulcer. Penetrating keratoplasty may be complicated by the recurrence and extension of the disease process into the donor tissue with resultant necrosis and sloughing. Penetrating keratoplasty may restore some vision in a healed and quiet eye with an opaque or scarred cornea.
-Crescentic annular lamellar graft: Crescentic annular lamellar graft is rarely used in cases of peripheral corneal thinning, when the cornea is not perforated.
-Central lamellar keratectomy: Some advocate removal of the presumed antigenic corneal stroma by central lamellar keratectomy, in an attempt to mediate a more rapid resolution of the inflammation.

Amniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation is an alternative treatment for reconstruction of ocular surface and corneal stroma damaged by an immunologic process. The exact mechanism of its function is not known but it has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anti- immunogenic qualities. A single layer amniotic membrane transplantation involves placing amniotic membrane stromal side down onto the ulcerated defect. Multilayer amniotic membrane may be placed into a stromal ulcer defect.
Keratoepithelioplasty: Keratoepithelioplasty is a new surgical procedure for the treatment of persistent epithelial defect in patients without healthy donor tissue in their fellow eyes. After a total superficial keratectomy, donor corneal lenticules covered by epithelium are placed at the corneoscleral limbus. The epithelium spreads from the lenticules and covers the center of the cornea.
Conjunctival flap: Conjunctival flap may provide comfort, reduce ocular inflammation, and promote healing in cases where medical/ surgical therapy fails, and patient experiences pain from recurrent epithelial breakdown with stromal ulceration. It is especially useful for elderly debilitated patients for whom prolonged hospitalisation and medical therapy may not be warranted.


Prognosis:
Most patients with unilateral disease respond fairly well to topical corticosteroids and conjunctival resection.
The prognosis is poor for more severe bilateral cases, and the primary goal is to reduce the chances of perforation and preserve the structure of the eye."
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The novel coronavirus was named as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
Since 2012, 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-Cov infection with 858 deaths were reported from 27 countries including Algeria, Austria, Bahrain, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Yemen.
About 80% of human cases were reported in Saudi Arabia. Investigations showed that people get infected there through unprotected contact with infected dromedary camels or infected people. Cases identified outside the Middle East are usually traveling people who were infected in the Middle East and then travelled to areas outside the Middle East.","The clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infection may be asymptomatic showing no symptoms or may show mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death.
Typical symptoms of MERS-CoV disease are

Fever,
Cough,
shortness of breath,
pneumonia,
respiratory failure- severe illness can cause respiratory failure
gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea

Disease can be more serious in older people, people with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.
Mortality rate among laboratory-confirmed cases was about 35%.","MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, which means virus can be transmitted between animals and people. Humans have got infection with MERS-CoV through direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. Dromedary camels are the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of infection in humans. It is believed that in past the virus may have originated in bats and then transmitted to camels.
However, more information is needed to figure out the possible role that camels and other animals may play in transmission of MERS-CoV.
Transmission of Infection:
Non-human to human transmission: Strains of MERS-CoV identical to human strains have been isolated from dromedaries in several countries, including Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. But the route of transmission from animals to humans is not fully understood.
Human-to-human transmission: The virus passes from human to human with close contact such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient, among patients and family members.
MERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, is thought to spread from an infected person’s respiratory secretions, such as through coughing.","There are two tests to detect MERS-CoV infection.
Molecular Tests-Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)-These tests are used to detect active infection (presence of MERS-CoV) in people who are thought to infected with MERS-CoV based on their clinical symptoms and having links to places where MERS-CoV has been reported.
Serology Tests-These tests are used to detect previous infection in people who may have been exposed to the virus, by detecting antibodies to MERS-CoV. (Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system to attack and kill viruses, bacteria, and other microbes during infection). The presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV indicates that a person had been previously infected with the virus. Serology tests are used for surveillance or investigational purposes and not for diagnostic purposes.",Treatment is supportive and based on the patient’s clinical condition. Severe illness can result into respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit.
Myopia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/myopia,"Myopia or short-sightedness is that type of refractive error where parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused in front of the light sensitive layer of retina with eyes in position of rest.
The term ‘myopia’ was introduced due to the habit of myopic people of half closing the eyelids while looking at distant objects, so that they may have the advantages of a stenopaeic slit (a black disc punctured with a fine slit or hole).
Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.
Emmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.
The term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.
Prevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers. Astigmatism change relatively little with age.","Congenital myopia: Child may present with

Anisometropia.
Amblyopia.
Congenital convergent squint.
Difficulty in distant vision.
Holding things very close to eyes for viewing.

Simple myopia

Poor vision for distance.
Asthenopia or eyestrain.
Change in psychological attitudes leading to more indoor activities.

Pathological myopia

Defective vision due to high refractive error.
Muscae volitantes or floating black spots due to vitreous degeneration.
Night blindness in high myopia due to vitreo-retinal degeneration.","Aetiologically, myopia may be of following types

Axial myopia: This is due to increased antero-posterior length of the eyeball. This is the commonest type.
Curvature myopia: This produced by the increased curvature of the cornea, lens or both.
Positional myopia: This is produced by the anterior placement of crystalline lens of the eye.
Index myopia: Index myopia is produced due to increase in the refractive index of crystalline lens due to nuclear sclerosis.
Myopia due to excessive accommodation: This occurs in patients with spasm of accommodation.

Optics
Image of distant object consists of circles of diffusion formed by the divergent beam of light, since the parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused in front of the retinal layer.
Far point of the myopic eye is a finite point in front of the retina. Due to this, near object situated at the far point is focussed on retina without an effort of accommodation.
Nodal point lies further away from retina in myopia. Thus, the image formed is appreciably larger than an emmetropic eye and in spectacle corrected eye.
In uncorrected myopia, accommodation is not developed normally, since they need not accommodate to see the near objects clearly. This results in convergence insufficiency, exophoria and early presbyopia.","Diagnosis depends upon clinical features and retinoscopy.
Clinical types of myopia
Congenital myopia: Congenital myopia is present since birth but is usually diagnosed by the age of about 2- 3 years. Mostly, it is unilateral and manifests as anisometropia. Rarely, it may be bilateral. It is usually produced due to increase in axial length of the eyeball. Refractive error is usually around 8- 10 D. It may be associated with

Prematurity.
Marfan’s syndrome.
Homocystinuria.
Congenital convergent strabismus (squint).
Congenital anomalies of eyes such as aniridia, cataract, microphthalmos (small eyeballs), megalocornea (large cornea), and congenital separation of retina.

Congenital myopia may be associated with amblyopia and congenital convergent squint. In bilateral myopia, child show some noticeable difficulty in seeing distant objects and tend to hold things very close to the eyes.

Simple or developmental myopia: This is the commonest type and is also known as physiological or school myopia. It is not associated with any other disease of the eye. This results from biological variation in the development of eye. It may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive condition. Axial type may signify just a physiological variation in the length of the eyeball. Curvature type is considered to be due to underdevelopment of the eyeball.
Most patients are born hypermetropic, but later become myopic with age. It usually begins around 7 to 10years of age and increases during the growing years. Besides visual symptoms, child may have signs such as

Large and prominent eyeballs.
Slightly deeper anterior chamber.
Slightly dilated pupils.
Fundus is usually normal. Rarely, there may be myopic crescent.


Pathological or degenerative myopia: Pathological or degenerative myopia is a rapidly progressive refractive error resulting in high myopia during early adult life. It is usually associated with degenerative changes in the eye. It results from rapid axial growth of the eyeball. It may be linked with heredity or general growth process.
Pathological myopia results from rapid axial growth of the eyeball which does not fall within normal biological variations of development. Beside symptoms, patient show signs such as

Prominent large eyes due to elongation of posterior pole of eye.
Larger cornea.
Deep anterior chamber.
Slightly larger pupils with sluggish reaction to light.
Large and pale optic disc with temporal myopic crescent. It may be peri-papillary (around optic disc) in some cases.
Super-traction crescent (retina being pulled over the disc margin) may be present on nasal side of optic disc.
Degeneration of choroid and retina.
Foster-Fuch’s spots, as dark red circular patch due to sub-retinal neovascularisation and choroidal haemorrhage, may be present.
Associated lattice degeneration and/or snail track lesion may be present in the periphery of retina.
Retinal tear, haemorrhage or retinal detachment may occur.
Posterior staphyloma due to scleral ectasia at the posterior pole.
Vitreous degeneration.
Posterior vitreous detachment seen as Weiss’ reflex.
Contraction of visual fields and ring scotoma may be present.
Electroretinography may reveal sub-normal electroretinogram due to chorio-retinal atrophy.


Acquired myopia: Acquired myopia may be produced due to

Index myopia: It may be produced due to change in refractive index e.g. nuclear sclerosis of the crystalline lens.
Curvature myopia: Increase in curvature of cornea or lens produces curvature myopia.
Positional myopia: It may be produced by anterior subluxation of the crystalline lens.
Consecutive myopia: It may be produced due to surgical overcorrection of hypermetropia or in pseudophakia with overcorrecting intraocular lens implants.
Pseudo-myopia or artificial myopia: This may be produced due to excessive accommodation and spasm of accommodation. Full hypermetropic correction in children may also lead to this.
Drug induced myopia: Certain drugs such as pilocarpine, steroids or sulphonamides may also produce myopia.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical therapy
Visual hygiene: This is important to avoid asthenopia. Proper posture and adequate illumination is required during close work.
Optical therapy:
Appropriate glasses/contact lenses may be used to provide clear retinal image.
Minimum correcting power providing maximum vision is given.
Children: Myopia up to 6 D in children, especially younger than 8 years, should be fully corrected and are advised to wear glasses constantly. It helps in developing normal accommodation- convergence reflex. Myopia should never be over-corrected.
Adults: Patients younger than 30 years, usually accept full correction. Patients over 30 years of age usually do not accept full correction, and are prescribed with glasses keeping power slightly under-corrected.
High myopia: As little correction as compatible with good vision is prescribed. Under-correction also avoids minification of the image.
Optical correction of eye includes

Spectacle correction: Spectacle correction may be given, but it produces minification of object size and distortion of peripheral image in cases with high myopia.
Contact lenses: These are particularly useful in cases of high myopia. These avoid peripheral minification in size as well as peripheral distortion of image.
Low vision and visual aids: Visual aids are indicated in patients with progressive myopia with retinal degenerative changes where useful vision may not be obtained with spectacles or contact lenses.


Surgical therapy includes:

Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): Keratomileusis refers to carving of cornea. Excimer laser ablation is applied directly to the corneal stroma after reflecting a lamellar or partial- thickness corneal flap. The flap is returned to its original position, once ablation is complete. Recovery of vision usually takes few days and some patients even take few weeks.
Wavefront- guided LASIK: Wave front- guided LASIK or custom LASIK is a new wave front technology to program ablation pattern more precisely than the conventional LASIK.
IntraLASIK (IntraLase): IntraLASIK uses femtosecond laser, which is more accurate than a blade and provides a huge margin in terms of precision and safety. Femtosecond laser creates a corneal flap at a pre-programmed depth and position.
EpiLASIK: EpiLASIK is designed to create a thin flap in the epithelium. It is an excellent alternative for patients with thin and steep or flat cornea. The layer is preserved and later replaced following reshaping of cornea using excimer laser.
Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK): PRK also uses excimer laser to reshape cornea, but this procedure does not require lamellar flap. The laser is applied directly to the anterior stromal surface after removal of surface epithelium. A soft contact lens is prescribed after laser treatment. The corneal epithelium typically heals in about 4 to 7 days. Improvement of vision may take few weeks to several months.
Laser sub-epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK): It involves cleaving the epithelial sheet at the basement membrane with dilute alcohol, applying laser as in conventional PRK, and repositioning the epithelium afterward.
Radial keratotomy (RK): In RK, spoke- like cuts radiating from central cornea at about 90% corneal depth were given to balloon the peripheral cornea. Although RK surgery was effective, the results were often unpredictable and led to overcorrection, with progressive hypermetropia. RK surgery was soon replaced by laser vision correction with the introduction of PRK.
Refractive lens exchange (RLE): Refractive lens exchange (RLE) is a surgical procedure that may correct refractive error by removing and replacing the clear crystalline lens of the eye with intraocular lenses (IOLs). RLE is an option for high refractive errors, where laser vision correction is not an option.
Phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) implant: Phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) may be implanted in front of and attached to the iris or is placed just behind the iris. Phakic IOL is an alternative to laser vision correction with keratorefractive surgery.


Contraindications to surgery:

Corneal or anterior segment diseases such as keratitis, conjunctivitis or corneal ulcers.


Prognosis
The prognosis is good in simple myopia. The refractive error usually stabilises by the age of 21 years.
In pathological myopia, visual prognosis is always guarded. There is possibility of progressive visual loss due to degeneration. The retina is stretched and thin, which may lead to retinal detachment."
Mumps,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/mumps,"Mumps is a viral infection and most often a mild disease of childhood. It affects children between five and nine years of age. However, the mumps can affect both adolescents and adults. Mumps virus is present throughout the world. It spreads by airborne droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs and by direct contact with an infected person. In temperate climates the disease incidence is peak in winter and spring while in hot climates the disease may occur at any time of year. Many countries experience epidemics at intervals of 2–5 years. Humans are the only known host for mumps virus. It primarily affects the salivary glands and it is sometimes called infectious parotitis.
In countries where large-scale immunization against mumps has been implemented, disease incidence has dropped dramatically. Before introduction of mumps vaccine, annual incidences were ranging from 100–1000 cases/100000 population.
In India outbreaks and sporadic cases are reported throughout the year and from all regions of the country. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India, has reported about 45 outbreaks of mumps from the different parts of the country in 2016. Passive reporting of mumps cases is also done by Indian academy of pediatrics (IAP) through its web based infectious disease surveillance system (IDSurv).
Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease. 121 countries or 62% countries of the world have included mumps vaccine in their routine schedule in the form of MMR vaccine.","After an incubation period (the period between infection and the appearance of signs of a disease) of some two to four weeks mumps begins with non-specific symptoms such as myalgia, headache, malaise and low-grade fever.
Within a day of appearance of non specific symptoms, unilateral or bilateral (one side or both side) swelling of the parotid glands (in cheek and jaw area) develops with pain and tenderness.
Swelling is first visible in front of the lower part of the ear then it extends downward and forward. As swelling increases, the angle of the jawbone below the ear is not visible.
Patients typically complain of worsening pain when eating or drinking acidic foods.
In approximately 10% of cases other salivary glands (submandibular and sublingual glands) may be affected.
After about a week, fever and glandular swelling disappear, and the illness resolves completely if there are no complications.
In approximately 30% of cases, only non-specific symptoms occur or the infection is asymptomatic.
People with mumps are usually considered most infectious for few days before and after onset of parotitis (infection of parotid gland).","Mumps is a viral disease caused by a virus (mumps virus) belongs to the genus Rubulavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It primarily affects the salivary glands. The incubation time (the period between infection and the appearance of signs of a disease) averages 16–18 days with a range of two to four weeks.
It mostly affects the children in the age group five to nine years but the virus may also affect adults in whom complications such as meningitis and orchitis are relatively more common. Males and females are affected equally with parotitis.
Transmission of infection: Mumps is a contagious disease. Infection spreads through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat by an infected person through direct contact, airborne droplet infection or fomites during:

coughing, sneezing, or talking,
sharing items, such as cups or eating utensils, with others, and
touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.

Mumps virus spreads before the salivary glands begin to swell and up to five days after the appearance of swelling. Natural infection with this virus is thought to confer lifelong protection.","Complete blood cell count (CBC) - A complete blood cell count reveals a normal, decreased, or elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, with predominating lymphocytes in differential count. 
Inflammatory markers-Sera inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), can be elevated to show a nonspecific systemic inflammatory response.
Serum amylase is elevated in mumps parotitis (amylase-S) and in pancreatitis (amylase-P). Serum lipase is elevated in pancreatitis.
Specific immunoglobulin-Mumps infection can be confirmed by a positive mumps-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) titer or bydemonstration of a significant rise in mumps-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers between acute and convalescent sera specimens. IgG titers can be detected by complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, or enzyme immunoassay. (Interpretation of titer rise may have limitations due to potential mumps cross-reaction with other parainfluenza viruses).
For diagnosis, an assay for the detection of mumps-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies in serum and oral fluid specimens is commercially available.
Mumps virus can be isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, and fluid from the buccal cavity typically within the period of seven days before and nine days after, the onset of parotitis.
Lumbar puncture- If meningitis or encephalitis is suspected, a lumbar puncture to obtain CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) for examination may be considered to clarify cause.
Auditory testing is indicated to assess for development of a hearing impairment.
Scrotal ultrasonography must be performed when orchitis is clinically suspected to rule out testicular torsion.","Conservative, supportive medical care is indicated for patients with mumps. No antiviral agent is indicated for treatment of this viral illness, as mumps is a self-limited disease. No specific therapy for mumps exists.
Analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) may be used for headaches or discomfort due to parotitis.
Topical application of warm or cold packs to the swollen parotid area may be used to soothe the painful area.
A light diet with plenty fluid intake is encouraged.
Acidic foods (such as tomato, vinegar-containing food additives) and liquids (such as orange juice) should be avoided to lessen oral pain and discomfort.
Stronger analgesics may be required for patients with orchitis with bed rest, scrotal support, and ice packs. Mumps without associated major complications can be managed on an outpatient basis.
It is advised to follow good hand washing practices.
Patients diagnosed with mumps should be isolated for 5 days from the onset of symptoms to minimize the risk of infecting others by staying home from work or school and staying in a separate room if possible."
Madarosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/madarosis,"Madarosis is defined as the loss or absence of eyelashes (ciliary madarosis) or eyebrows (superciliary madarosis) or both. The term madarosis was originally coined to denote loss of eyelashes due to destruction of hair follicles. But now, this term encompasses loss of cilia either of eyelashes or eyebrows or both. Loss of eyelashes is also known as milphosis. Madarosis as a clinical sign has varied aetiology. This may be a manifestation of local or systemic diseases. Chronic blepharitis is one of the common causes of madarosis. It may be scarring or non-scarring type, depending upon the aetiology.
The word madarosis is of Greek origin, in which ‘’ madao’’ means to fall off.
Eyelashes protect the eyeball from small foreign bodies due to inherent reflex closure of the eyes. Eyebrows protect bony ridges above the eyes. Eyelashes and eyebrows have important cosmetic function as well.","Symptoms of madarosis are mainly cosmetic.
Patients present with loss of eyelashes over some part of or complete eyelid margin.
Patient may be asymptomatic or may have associated redness or itching.","Causes of madarosis are varied and include
Local

Chronic blepharitis.
Trauma.
Burns.
Eyelid infections such as herpes, syphilis, or leprosy.
Eyelid neoplasm.
Psychiatric condition like trichotillomania.

Systemic

Endocrine disorders like hypothyroidism.
Skin conditions such as acne vulgaris, psoriasis or seborrhoeic dermatitis.
Use of medications like topical epinephrine.
Connective tissue disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus.
Nutritional deficit.","Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination of eyes (both eyebrows and eyelids) including facial skin and scalp.
Clinically, patients present with loss of eyelashes over some or whole of eyelid margin. Stumps of cilia may be visible broken off at or a few millimetres from the surface of skin.
Patients with focal areas of madarosis or telangiectasia should be evaluated for neoplasm.
Based on suspicion of aetiology, patient may be investigated for any nutritional or hormonal deficit.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
No adequate treatment is available in most of the cases.
Medical therapy
Management includes treatment of underlying aetiology.
Cessation of the use of long term topical epinephrine therapy has shown re-growth of previously lost lashes. Similarly, treatment of blepharitis may prevent further loss of eyelashes.
Therapy of malignant neoplasms causing madarosis is a priority and is more important than treating madarosis alone.

Surgical therapy
Surgical procedures include

Pentagonal eyelid resection: Full-thickness pentagonal eyelid resection of the abnormal area may be contemplated in patients with localised madarosis.
Pentagonal eyelid resection with Lateral Canthoplasty: This procedure is adopted when the affected area is little larger which cannot be treated with pentagonal eyelid resection alone.
Hair transplantation: Hair may be taken from eyebrow, temporal eyelid or scalp for transplantation in areas of madarosis.


Prognosis
Prognosis depends upon underlying aetiology."
Mastitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/mastitis,"Mastitis is inflammation of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. Mastitis is more common in the lactational phase affecting one in five breastfeeding women. 74% to 95% cases of mastitis occur in the first 12 weeks after child birth especially in the second and third week postpartum. It is one of the reasons for early discontinuation of breastfeeding, which provides optimal infant nutrition
When mastitis occurs during lactation, it is called lactation or puerperal mastitis and in non-lactating women it is called periductal mastitis. Untreated infective mastitis can lead to breast abscess, which is localized collection of pus within the breast. Breast abscess is also common in the first six weeks’ post-partum, but may occur later.
The risk of mastitis can be reduced by providing ongoing support to maintain frequent, complete emptying of the breast and proper breastfeeding technique during lactational phase by health care providers.","Breast pain is the primary symptom of mastitis. Other symptoms and signs of mastitis are:

Breast swelling
Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern
Breast tenderness, or warmth to touch
Pain or a burning sensation continuously or while breast-feeding
Feeling ill
Fever of 101 F (38.3 C) or greater
Hard lump in breast
Discharge from nipple","Milk stasis and infection are two important causes of mastitis. Milk stasis is usually the primary cause, which may or may not be accompanied by or progress to infection.
Milk stasis occurs when baby is not sucking properly, and milk is collected within the breast tissue of lactating woman, that may lead to non-infectious inflammation (or non-infectious mastitis). As the stagnant milk provides a suitable environment for the bacteria to grow (without effective removal of milk) non-infectious mastitis may progress to infectious mastitis, and further to formation of an abscess.
Various reasons for milk stasis may be:

Poor attachment of the infant at the breast;
ineffective suckling;
restriction of the frequency or duration of feeds;
a blocked milk duct;
an overabundant milk supply;
lactating for twins or higher multiples.
Cracked nipple: Fissured or painful nipples may lead to avoidance of feeding on the affected breast and thus predispose to milk stasis. The commonest cause of trauma is poor attachment at the breast. Bacteria from women’s skin or baby's mouth can enter the milk ducts through a crack in the skin of nipple or through a milk duct opening.
A short frenulum (tongue-tie) in the infant has been observed clinically to interfere with attachment at the breast, and may cause cracked nipple.
Use of a pacifier or a bottle and teat may be associated with poor attachment at the breast, sore nipples, and reduction in breastfeeding frequency and duration. Pacifiers may thus interfere with milk removal and predispose to milk stasis.
Tight clothing, and prone sleeping position are other mechanical factors that have been observed in connection with mastitis.
Mastitis may occur in the breast opposite to the preferred side for lactation.

The commonest organisms found in mastitis and breast abscess are coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus but less commonly, Streptococcus or    Escherichia colimay be found.","Most cases of mastitis are diagnosed clinically. Medical care provider/doctor will ask about the various symptoms fever, pain, lactational history, and any medicinal intake. On clinical examination of the breast he/she will focus on looking for signs of inflammation (erythema, localised tenderness, heat, engorgement and swelling) and nipple damage.
Breast abscess is characterized by symptoms similar to mastitis, with the additional sign of a discrete tender lump, which may be tense or fluctuant. The mass may have overlying skin necrosis suggesting that the abscess is ‘pointing’ (abscess is sitting close to the surface of the skin).
Examination of the infant and attachment to the breast: The infant should be examined for anatomical conditions such as cleft palate or tongue-tie which may interfere with attachment.
Investigation- Mastitis is a clinical diagnosis and investigations are not indicated in the initial assessment. If symptoms don’t improve few days after proper management following investigations may be advised.

Ultrasound: Breast infection that does not improve with a course of appropriate antibiotics should be investigated with breast ultrasound.
Mammography: It is not a first line investigation in lactating women but is indicated if clinical, sonographic or biopsy features are suspicious for malignancy.
Bacteriological examination: Breastmilk for culture may be obtained by collecting a hand-expressed midstream clean-catch sample into a sterile container (i.e., a small quantity of the initially expressed milk is discarded to avoid contamination of the sample with skin flora, and subsequent milk is expressed into the sterile container, taking care not to touch the inside of the container). Cleansing the nipple prior to collection may further reduce skin contamination and minimize false-positive culture results.","Management of mastitis consist of effective milk removal and antibiotics if infection is suspected.
Simple analgesics like oral paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are safe in breast feeding can be used to relieve pain.
Support for continued breastfeeding: In addition to effective treatment and control of pain, a woman needs emotional support. Continued breastfeeding should be encouraged in the presence of mastitis and generally it does not pose a risk to the infant. She needs reassurance about the value of breastfeeding that it is safe to continue breastfeeding and milk from the affected breast will not harm her infant.
Hot and cold packs to breast: As milk stasis is often the initiating factor in mastitis, mother can apply heat (warm compresses or a warm shower)) to the breast prior to feedings.
Effective milk removal: This is the most essential part of management of mastitis. Antibiotics and symptomatic treatment may make a woman feel better temporarily, but unless milk removal is improved, the condition may become worse or relapse despite the antibiotics.
Mother should be encouraged to breastfeed more frequently, as often and as long as the infant is willing, without restrictions starting on the affected breast. If necessary express breast-milk by hand or with a pump, until breastfeeding can be resumed.
Infant should be well attached to the breast during breastfeeding and if there is any problem with attachment, mother should be helped by health care provider/ caregiver. If attachment is painful, a breast pump can be used to drain the breast until the pain decreases enough to allow the baby to feed from the breast.
Massaging the breast during the feed with an edible oil or nontoxic lubricant on the fingers may also be helpful to facilitate milk removal. Massage, by the mother or a helper, should be directed from the blocked area moving toward the nipple.
Antibiotic therapy: Health care provider may advise for antibiotic therapy in following situations:

cell and bacterial colony counts and culture of breast milk are available and indicate infection,
symptoms are severe from the beginning, or
a nipple fissure is visible, or
symptoms do not improve after 12-24 hours of improved milk removal.

The chosen antibiotic must be given for an adequate length of time. (Tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol are not advised as they are unsafe for use in lactating women.)
Identification and drainage of breast abscess:
If an abscess has formed, it needs pus removal. This can be done by surgical incision and drainage under general anesthesia. Pus can also be removed by aspiration, guided by ultrasound, if available. This procedure is less painful and can be done under local anesthesia. Systemic treatment with appropriate antibiotics is also required along with aspiration of pus.
Mother should be encouraged for breastfeeding and should be reassured that milk is safe for her baby when she is taking appropriate antibiotic."
Mouth Ulcers,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/mouth-ulcers,"Mouth ulcers are usually pale or yellow painful sores with a red outer ring. These appear inside mouth, on the cheeks, lips and sometimes can also appear on the tongue. Usually a single ulcer inside mouth may be due to cheek or tongue biting, or damage caused by sharp teeth, aggressive brushing or poorly fittingdentures. These ulcers are known as ‘traumatic' ulcers. More than one ulcer inside mouth which are recurrent in nature are called Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS).
These are different fromcold sores and are not contagious. Cold sores appear on the outer lips or around the mouth and are caused by a virus. They often begin with a tingling, itching or burning sensation.

APHTHOUS STOMATITIS OR CANKER SORES
Aphthous stomatitis is a common ailment, with single or multiple ulcerations of the oral mucosa; usually self-limiting, painful, or recurrent.
It affects approximately 20% of the general population and itis slightly more common in girls and women. Typical age of onset is in childhood or early adulthood, becoming less common with advancing age.","Aphthous ulcers present as well-circumscribedlesions with central necrotic region of gray, fibrinous exudate surrounded by an erythematoushalo on the non-keratinised oral mucosa. Pain severity depends on the type of ulcer. Typical locations of ulcers include the buccal (cheek) and labial (lip) mucosa, the floor of the mouth, the ventral surface of the tongue, and the soft palate.","Aphthous ulcers are idiopathic (exact cause is not clear) and multifactorial, but likely involves activation of the cell-mediated immune system.
These factors may include:

Local trauma due to badly fitting dentures, braces, rough fillings or a sharp tooth, cuts or burns while eating or drinking hard food or hot drinks
Emotional or physiologic stress, hormonal states (menstruation or pregnancy)
Food hypersensitivity (such as cinnamon, cheese, citrus, figs or pineapple), sensitivity to sodium lauryl sulfate and certain medications (NSAIDs, beta-blockers or nicorandil).
Many cases are related to iron, folic acid, vitamin B6 or B12 deficiency.
Family history, immunological, and microbial factors are important in the onset of recurrent aphthous ulcerations.
Systemic illness such as malabsorption, enteropathy, coeliac disease/inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis (e.g., Behcet’s syndrome), reactive arthritis (e.g., Reiter’s syndrome), and HIV/AIDS.
Aphthous stomatitis is more prevalent in non-smokers and smokers who quit smoking.
Less common in individuals with good oral hygiene practices.","Based on the clinical examination and on the patient’s medical history, a diagnosis of aphthous ulcers is determined.",No Management.
Malocclusion,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/malocclusion,"Malocclusion is the misalignment of teeth of upper or lower jaw or both jaws.
The literal meaning of word malocclusion is “bad bite” or “irregular bite”. Malocclusion may be present as crooked, crowded, protruding teeth, spacing between upper front teeth or generalized spacing between upper or lower teeth. It may affect a person’s appearance, speech, and/or ability to eat.
Gardiner, White and Leighton defined malocclusion as “A condition where there is a departure from the normal relation of teeth to other teeth in the same arch and/or to teeth in the opposing arch.”
It is a morphological variation and one of the most prevalent oral pathologies, next only to dental caries and periodontal diseases.
Malocclusion adversely affects the facial appearance of an individual, may cause psychological disturbances and have a negative effect on self- image. It increases the risk of caries, predispose to periodontal diseases, temporomandibular joint problems, speech defects and improper respiration. Worldwide data shows that malocclusion is more prevalent in whites than in black, more in developed countries than in developing countries, and more in urban as compared to rural populations.

1. General Factors – Heredity, congenital defects such as cleft lip and palate, environment (prenatal and postnatal), habits like thumb sucking or finger sucking, lip or nail biting, tongue thrusting, respiratory problem like mouth breathing, trauma and accidents.
2. Local Factors includes- Abnormality in tooth shape, size and number; premature tooth loss, prolonged tooth retention, delayed eruption of permanent teeth, premature tooth loss.
Most often it occurs in children whose parents have malocclusion. When children have less or no space between their primary/baby teeth, they are at risk of having malocclusion, because the permanent teeth are larger and require more space.

Mouth Breathing,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/mouth-breathing,"Breathing is a vital function of the human body, normally done through the nose. Abnormal, habitual breathing through the mouth instead of the nose is known as mouth breathing. It is a common clinical problem in children and is detrimental to their health. Mouth breathing may be due to blockage in nasal passage, deviated nasal septum, enlarged adenoids or an infection in the nose &amp; throat. Mouth breathers with enlarged adenoids (a mass of tissue at the back of the nasal cavity) develop “Adenoid Faces” manifested by elongated face with an expressionless and open-mouthed appearance. Mouth breathing may cause dryness of mouth leading to bad breath and gingivitis. Classification of mouth breathing and determining its type in a patient is very important for effective treatment. Obstructive mouth breathing is best treated by a rhinologist, whereas habitual mouth breathing is corrected by a pedodontist or orthodontist.
DEFINITION
Sassouni defined mouth breathing as the habitual respiration through the mouth instead of the nose.
Merle suggested the term oro-nasal breathing instead of mouth breathing.

Narcolepsy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. It is a disorder in which a person falls asleep at inappropriate times. People with narcolepsy generally experience disturbed nocturnal sleep and an abnormal daytime sleep pattern, which is often confused withinsomnia.
Narcoleptics, when falling asleep, generally experience the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) stage of sleep within 5 minutes, while most people without narcolepsy may not experience REM sleep until an hour. REM sleep is where most dreams occur.","Excessive Daytime Sleepiness:
The main characteristic of narcolepsy is Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) in which even after adequate night time sleep. A person becomes drowsy or fall asleep or just be very tired throughout the day, often at inappropriate times and places.
Cataplexy:
Cataplexy i.e. a sudden muscular weakness brought on by strong emotions (though many people experience cataplexy without having an emotional trigger) . It often manifests as muscular weakness ranging from a bare slackening of the facial muscles to the dropping of the jaw or head, feeling weak at the knees (often referred to as ""knee buckling ""), or a total collapse.
Other symptoms include:

Hallucinations – seeing or hearing things that are not real
Difficulty concentrating
Restless night-time sleep
Automatic behaviour – continuing to carry out normal activities, such as talking or moving around, while you are still asleep","Narcolepsy is known to be caused by an autoimmune response.
In 2010, scientists in Switzerland discovered that the reduction of chemical (hypocretin) in brain is caused by an autoimmune response to an antibody called trib 2. The trib 2 antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce orexin. The attack leads to a deficiency in orexin, which results in narcolepsy and, in particular, narcolepsy with cataplexy (temporary muscle weakness).","Diagnosis is relatively easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. It is also possible for cataplexy to occur in isolation . Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are:
The polysomnogram:
The polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep brain waves and a number of nerve and muscle functions during nighttime sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may awaken often during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.
Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT):
For the Multiple sleep latency test, a person is given a chance to sleep every 2 hours during normal waking time. The patient is usually subjected to an overnight sleep study.
Epworth Sleepiness Scale:
The Epworth sleepiness scale is a brief questionnaire that is administered to determine the likelihood of the presence of a sleep disorder, including narcolepsy These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist.","There is no specific cure of the disease. One of the best ways to manage excessive daytime sleepiness is to take frequent, brief naps evenly spaced through the day.
Lifestyle:
These include:

Stress can make the condition worse.
Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help improve your levels of alertness.
Taking regular exercise but stop at least three hours before you go to bed"
Nasal Polyps,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/respiratory-tract/nasal-polyps,"Nasal polyps are polypoidal masses arising mainly from the mucous membranes of the nose and paranasal sinuses. They are overgrowths of the mucosa that frequently accompany allergic rhinitis. They are freely movable and non tender.
Nasal polyps are abnormal tissue growths that grow inside the nasal passages and sinuses. Sinuses are small, air-filled cavities found within the bones of the face. You have sinuses on either side of your nose and behind your cheekbones, eyes and forehead. Nasal polyps vary in size. They can be yellow, grey or pink in colour. Each polyp is teardrop-shaped, and they look like grapes on a stem when fully grown. Large nasal polyps can block nasal passages and cause symptoms such as a blocked or runny nose and loss of smell and taste.","The symptoms of polyps can include:

Blocked nose - which may cause breathing difficulties
Snoring
Runny nose
Mucus that drips from the back of nose down the throat - known as post-nasal drip
Reduced sense of smell or taste - in severe cases, one may lose sense of smell or taste completely","Nasal polyps are thought to occur as a result of inflammation in the lining (mucus membrane) of the nasal cavities and sinuses. While the exact cause of nasal polyps is not known.
Various risk factors involved:

Asthma
Allergic rhinitis - Where cold-like symptoms develop as a result of an allergic reaction.
Age- Nasal polyps are commonly seen in adults aged about 40 years
Cystic fibrosis - Where the lungs and digestive system become clogged with a sticky fluid.
Churg-Strauss syndrome - A rare condition that causes the blood vessels to become inflamed.","Nasal polyps are mostly diagnosed through symptoms:
Nasal Endoscopy:
Nasal polyps can also be identified using a procedure called an endoscopy to examine nasal passages.
A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses and nasal passages can also be carried out.
Cystic fibrosis:If the patient is a young child the doctor may order a cystic fibrosis test. This test is used to measures the amount of sodium and chloride in the child's sweat. A series of X-rays helps in giving a more detailed image of the sinuses and nasal passages. Polyps will show up as opaque (not transparent) areas in the sinuses and the walls of nasal passageways.","Nasal polyps are generally treated through steroid nasal spray and medications.
Antibiotics should only be taken if there is an associated bacterial sinus infection.

Surgery can also be performed, in case of larger polyps.
Polypectomy - This is the most common surgical procedure for the removal of polyps.
Endoscopic sinus surgery - This procedure is used if the polyps are particularly large, in clusters, or are seriously blocking the sinuses."
Neonatal Respiratory Disease Syndrome(NRDS),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/lungs/neonatal-respiratory-disease-syndrome-nrds,"It is also called asInfant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS). It is a serious medical condition where a newborn baby's lungs cannot provide their body with enough oxygen. NRDS is also known as hyaline membrane disease, infant respiratory distress syndrome or newborn respiratory distress syndrome.
IRDS begins shortly after birth and is manifest by tachypnea, tachycardia, chest wall retractions (recession), expiratory grunting, nasal flaring and cyanosis during breathing efforts.
Clinical course:
As the disease progresses, the baby may develop ventilatory failure (rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood), and prolonged cessations of breathing (""apnea""). Whether treated or not, the clinical course for the acute disease lasts about 2 to 3 days. During the first day the condition worsens and requires more support. During the second day the baby may be remarkably stable on adequate support and resolution is noted during the third day, with a prompt diuresis.
Despite huge advances in health care, NRDS remains the most common single cause of death in the first month of life in the developed world.","Along with tachypnea and tachycardia.
There include:

Bluish color of the skin and mucus membranes (cyanosis)
Apnea
Decreased urine output
Grunting
Nasal flaring
Rapid breathing
Shallow breathing
Unusual breathing movement like drawing back of the chest muscles with breathing",It is caused by developmental deficiency of surfactant (slippery and protective substance) production and structural immaturity in the lungs. It can also result from a genetic problem with the production of surfactant associated proteins.,"These tests may include:

Physical examination- To check for the distinctive signs and symptoms of NRDS
Blood tests-To measure the amount of oxygen in the blood and check for an infection
A pulse oximetry test- To measure how much oxygen is being absorbed in the blood, using a sensor attached to the fingertip, ear or toe.
A chest X-ray- To look for the distinctive cloudy appearance of NRDS
An echocardiogram- A type of ultrasound scan that is used to create a picture of the inside of the heart","Babies that are born premature or are at high risk for the respiratory diseases, should be treated at birth by a medical team that specializes in newborn breathing problems.
Artificial surfactant to an infant might be helpful.

Infants should be given warm, moist oxygen. However, this treatment needs to be monitored carefully to avoid side effects from too much oxygen.

A breathing machine is sometime used on the babies. Breathing machines can damage the lung tissue so use should be avoided when possible. Babies may need to use a breathing machine if they have:

High levels of carbon dioxide in the arteries
Low blood oxygen in the arteries
Low blood pH (acidity)
Repeated pauses in breathing


A treatment called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may prevent the need for a breathing machine in many babies. CPAP uses a device that sends air into the nose to help keep the airways open."
Neuralgia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/neuralgia,"Neuralgia is pain in one or more nerves caused by a change in neurological structure or function of the nerves rather than by excitation of healthy pain receptors.

Types of trigeminal neuralgia
Trigeminal neuralgia can be divided into different categories depending on the type of pain. These are described below.

Trigeminal neuralgia type 1 (TN1) is the classic form of trigeminal neuralgia. The piercing and stabbing pain can occur at any time and is not constant. This type of neuralgia is known as idiopathic (when no cause can be identified)
Trigeminal neuralgia type 2 (TN2) can be referred to as atypical (not typical) trigeminal neuralgia. Pain is more constant and involves aching, throbbing and burning sensations
Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) is when pain results from an underlying cause, such as multiple sclerosis","The main symptom of neuralgia is a sudden severe stabbing or piercing pain in the area of distribution of concerned nerve. It can be due to irritation or damage to the nerve.

Increased sensitivity of the skin in area of distribution of the damaged nerve, so that any touch or pressure is felt as pain
Numbness along the path of the nerve
Weakness or complete paralysis of muscles supplied by the same nerve","Causes of neuralgia include:

Chemical irritation
Chronic renal insufficiency
Diabetes
Infections, such as herpes zoster ( shingles), HIV, Lyme disease, andsyphilis
Pressure on nerves by nearby bones, ligaments, blood vessels, or tumours
Trauma (including surgery)","Diagnosis of neuralgia can be difficult at times. It can be diagnosed with the help of tests like:
Laser evoked potentials
Laser evoked potentials (LEPs) are used to measure cortical responses to selectively stimulate thermonociceptors in the skin. Lasers can emit a radiant-heat pulse stimulus to selectively activate A-delta and C free nerve endings. It specifically targets the pain and temperature pathways and measuring cortical responses, doctors can identify even minute lesions in the spinothalamic pathways. LEP abnormalities are strongly indicative of neuropathic pain, while a normal LEP is often more ambiguous. LEPs have high sensitivity and are very reliable in assessing damage to both central and peripheral nervous systems.
Punch skin biopsy
Recently, skin biopsy has also been used to investigate mechanoreceptorsand their myelinated afferents. Though available in only a few research centers, skin punch biopsy is an easy procedure and is minimally invasive. Punch skin biopsy is used to quantify nerve fibers C fibers and A-delta nerve fibers through measurement of the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF). Loss of IENF has been observed in several cases of neuropathic pain.","Treatment include both medicines and surgery,
Anticonvulsant medicines:They are used to block nerve pathways and tricyclic antidepressants are generally effective in treating neuralgia.

Surgery:Neural augmentative surgery is used to stimulate the affected nerve. Electrodes are carefully placed in the dorsal root and subcutaneous nerve stimulation is used to stimulate the targeted nerve pathway."
Nipah virus infection,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/nipah-virus-infection,"Nipah virus (NiV) infection is a new emerging zoonotic disease (transmissible from animals to humans) affecting both animals (pigs and other domestic animals) and humans. Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae Family, Pteropus genus are the natural host for the virus.
NiV was first identified in Malaysia in 1998, during an outbreak of disease that occurred in a place called Kampung Sungai Nipah. Pigs were the intermediate hosts in this outbreak and most of the human cases resulted from exposure to ill pigs. After that in Singapore during March 1999 eleven abattoir workers developed NiV infection following close contact with imported pigs from Malaysia. 
Outbreak of Nipah virus infection was reported in Bangladesh in 2001. Since then, outbreaks of Nipah virus encephalitis have been reported almost every year in selected districts of Bangladesh. Consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by flying bats was the primary source of human NiV infection in Bangladesh.
In India outbreaks of NiV infection were reported from Siliguri (January-February 2001) and Nadia (April-2007) districts in West Bengal. Seventy one cases with 50 deaths (70% of the cases) occurred in two outbreaks. Recently in May 2018 an outbreak of NiV infection is reported from Kerala. 
Outbreaks reported from South-East Asia have a seasonal pattern with occurrence during winter and spring (December-May). This pattern could be associated with several factors like the breeding season of the bats, increased shedding of virus by the bats and the date palm sap harvesting season. Nipah cases may occur in a cluster or as an outbreak.
There is strong evidence that loss of natural habitats of bats by human activity may attribute to emergence of bat-related viral infection communicable to humans and animals.","Symptoms of disease may appear with in 5 to 14 days (incubation period) after an exposure to infection:

Clinical presentations of NiV infection in humans varies from asymptomatic infection to fever, headache for 3-14 days followed by drowsiness, respiratory illness, disorientation and mental confusion.
In severe cases these signs and symptoms can progress to coma within 24-48 hours.
The case fatality rate ranges from 9 to 75%.
Those who may have recovered from an acute episode may also have a relapse.
Long-term sequelae following Nipah virus infection have been noted in the form of persistent convulsions and personality changes.
Latent infections with subsequent reactivation of Nipah virus and death have also been reported months and even years after exposure","Nipah virus (NiV) infection is caused by a virus, that is named after the Malaysian village where it was first discovered. NiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus.
Mode of transmission-
Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus have been identified as natural reservoirs of NiV. Bats are symptomless carriers of NiV, but infected bats shed virus in their excretion and secretion such as saliva, urine, semen and excreta. The NiV is highly contagious among pigs and spreads by coughing.
Transmission of disease can occur-

After direct contact with infected bats, infected pigs.

Human to human transmission by direct contact from other NiV infected people.
By consumption of raw date palm sap and fruits contaminated with infectious bat excretions.","Laboratory confirmation of NiV Infection in a suspected case of NiV can be done during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease by using a combination of tests.

Virus isolation attempts and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from throat and nasal swabs, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and blood can be performed in the early stages of disease.
Antibody detection by ELISA (IgG and IgM) can be used in later stages.
In fatal cases (after death), immunohistochemistry on tissues collected during autopsy may be the only way to confirm a diagnosis.","There is no effective treatment for NiV disease, Intensive supportive care is the primary treatment for human cases, though use of an antiviral medication (ribavarin ) may reduce the symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and convulsions.
Treatment is mostly focused on managing fever and neurological symptoms. Severely ill individuals may require the use of a ventilator.
A vaccine is being developed."
Neonatal Conjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/neonatal-conjunctivitis,"Neonatal conjunctivitis (Ophthalmia neonatorum) is defined as a conjunctival inflammation that occurs during first month of life after birth. Various causes have been implicated such as bacterial, viral including chemical conjunctivitis. Complications may be mild such as hyperaemia with scant conjunctival discharge to permanent scarring leading to even blindness.
Neonatal conjunctivitis may be septic or aseptic:
Septic neonatal conjunctivitis:
Viral and bacterial infections are the leading causes of septic neonatal conjunctivitis. Chlamydial conjunctivitis (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes D-K) is the most common infective cause of neonatal conjunctivitis. Infective agents causing neonatal conjunctivitis may be transmitted to infant during delivery through birth canal. Simple bacterial conjunctivitis may be caused by organisms like Staphylococcus aureus. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 may cause blepharoconjunctivitis and may involve cornea leading to keratitis.
Aseptic conjunctivitis:
Silver nitrate solution (1 %) is used for prophylaxis (prevention) of infectious conjunctivitis (Credé’s method). Aseptic neonatal conjunctivitis is commonly caused by the use of silver nitrate solution resulting in chemical conjunctivitis. Less commonly, Neonatal conjunctivitis may also be caused by antibiotics as well, which are used for prevention of infection. Chemical conjunctivitis is less common owing to the use of antibiotic such as erythromycin eye ointment in place of silver nitrate solution for the prophylaxis of infective conjunctivitis.
Healthcare providers and parents should wash hands frequently to prevent transmission of infection. Sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and herpes simplex should be treated before the birth of infant through vaginal route.
The development of neonatal conjunctivitis in infant is influenced by the structure of conjunctival tissue. Inflammation may cause dilatation of blood vessels, discharge from eyes or chemosis (swelling) of conjunctiva. These changes tend to be more severe due to poor immunity, lack of immunoglobulin A (IgA), lack of tears at birth, decreased lysozyme activity and absence of lymphoid tissue in the conjunctiva.","Manifestations of neonatal conjunctivitis depend upon the aetiological agent and its incubation period (period between infection of an individual by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness).
Incubation period:
- Chemical conjunctivitis: Chemical conjunctivitis usually takes place on the first day of life following exposure to an irritant like silver nitrate solution. It resolves spontaneously within 2-4 days.
- Chlamydial conjunctivitis: The incubation period for chlamydial conjunctivitis varies from 5-14 days.
- Gonococcal conjunctivitis: Gonococcal conjunctivitis tends to manifest from 2-7 days after infection. It can present later as well in some cases.
- Miscellaneous non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal conjunctivitis: The incubation period for miscellaneous non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal conjunctivitis also varies from 5-14 days like chlamydial conjunctivitis.
- Herpes simplex conjunctivitis: Conjunctivitis due to Herpes simplex usually occurs within first two weeks after birth and has an incubation period of about 6-14 days.
Symptoms of common causes of conjunctivitis are:
Chemical conjunctivitis:
Chemical conjunctivitis present with:
- Mild redness of eyes.
- Slight swelling of eyes.
Chlamydial conjunctivitis:
- Redness of eyes.
- Swelling of eyelids.
- Purulent discharge.
Gonococcal conjunctivitis:
- Red eyes.
- Swelling of eyelids.
- Profuse purulent discharge.
Miscellaneous Non-chlamydial non-gonococcal conjunctivitis:
- Red eyes.
- Swelling of eyelids.
- Some purulent discharge.
Herpes simplex conjunctivitis:
- Moderate redness of eyes.
- Swelling of eyelids.
-Non-purulent or sero-sanguinous (containing serum or blood) discharge.","The main causes of neonatal conjunctivitis are:
Chemical conjunctivitis:
Neonatal conjunctivitis is commonly caused due to post-delivery use of ophthalmic silver nitrate given for the prophylaxis of ocular infection.
Bacterial conjunctivitis:
Bacteria causing neonatal conjunctivitis are:
- Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D-K).
- Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
- Staphylococcus aureus.
- Staphylococcus epidermidis.
- Streptococcus haemolyticus.
- Pneumococcus.
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common infectious cause of neonatal conjunctivitis.

Gonococcus causes most serious of neonatal conjunctivitis.

Pseudomonas, although rare, may lead to potentially blinding complications such as corneal ulceration and even perforation.

Other bacteria which may infect are - Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia or Enterobacter.

Viral infections may be:
- Herpes simplex virus.
Risk factors for neonatal conjunctivitis are:
- Maternal infections carried in birth canal.
- Exposure of infant to infections.
- Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected mothers.
- Ocular injury during delivery.
- Inadequate ocular prophylaxis immediately after birth.
- Premature babies.
- Poor antenatal care.
- Poor and unhygienic delivery conditions.
- Post- delivery exposure to infection.","Diagnosis depends upon the clinical presentation and lab investigations.
Prompt diagnosis is necessary to institute appropriate treatment and thereby minimising potential serious complications of the disease.
Clinical manifestations of disease in newborn following birth, plays an important role in identifying the likely cause.
A thorough examination of the eye and periocular structures is crucial. Systemic manifestations of the disease should also be looked for an appropriate diagnosis.
Non-specific clinical features of neonatal conjunctivitis include:
- Swelling of eyelids.
- Conjunctival congestion (redness).
- Watering from the eyes.
- Mucoid or Mucopurulent discharge.
- Chemosis (swelling) of conjunctiva.
Specific clinical features and clinical course of disease process may be:
Chemical conjunctivitis:
Chemical conjunctivitis results in mild conjunctival congestion with watering. It resolves spontaneously within 2-4 days.
More concentrated solution of silver nitrate may result in severe response with lid oedema, chemosis of conjunctiva, exudates, membrane or pseudo-membrane (formed by deposition of fibrin rich exudates) formation and permanent scarring leading to damage to conjunctiva or cornea.
Chlamydial conjunctivitis:
Presentation of chlamydial conjunctivitis may vary from mild hyperaemia with scant mucoid discharge to eyelid swelling, chemosis and even pseudo-membrane formation on conjunctiva.
Chlamydial conjunctivitis typically presents with unilateral or bilateral watery discharge, which later becomes copious and purulent with time.
Follicular reaction in conjunctiva does not occur because there is no requisite lymphoid tissue present.
Blindness is rare and much slower to develop and is due to corneal opacification being produced due to eyelid scarring and corneal pannus formation.
Chlamydial conjunctivitis may be associated with extraocular systemic manifestations such as pneumonitis, otitis or rectal/ pharyngeal colonisation.

Gonococcal conjunctivitis:

Gonococcal conjunctivitis has rapid onset and produces most serious conjunctivitis than the other causes of neonatal conjunctivitis and may be associated with severe lid oedema (swelling), acute conjunctivitis and chemosis. A conjunctival membrane may be present.
Classically, it leads to bilateral severe purulent conjunctivitis.
Involvement of cornea is the most serious ocular (pertaining to eye) complication of gonococcal conjunctivitis. Initially, superficial keratitis produces lacklustre corneal appearance. Gonococcal conjunctivitis may lead to diffuse epithelial oedema, opacification and corneal ulceration (particularly in periphery), which may progress to corneal perforation or endophthalmitis (inflammation inside the eye).
Gonococcal conjunctivitis may be associated with systemic manifestations such as stomatitis, rhinitis, arthritis, anorectal infection, meningitis or septicaemia.

Miscellaneous non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal conjunctivitis:
Non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal conjunctivitis may cause swollen lids, redness of eyes, chemosis with mucopurulent discharge, which are variable and often indistinguishable from other causes.
Pseudomonas conjunctivitis, though rare, can have devastating consequences, such as rapid progression to corneal ulceration and perforation. Untreated Pseudomonas keratitis (inflammation of cornea) may lead to endophthalmitis (infection inside eyeball) and may be life threatening.

Herpes simplex conjunctivitis:
Herpes simplex keratoconjunctivitis is characterised by unilateral or bilateral lid oedema, moderate conjunctival congestion, vesicles on periocular skin and non-purulent sero-sanguinous discharge. It may be associated with formation of conjunctival membrane.
Involvement of corneal epithelium shows typical signs of herpetic keratitis in the form of micro-dendrites or geographic ulcers.
There may be generalised serious systemic herpes simplex infection such as encephalitis (inflammation of brain) owing to poor immunological response in infants.

Laboratory diagnosis: 
Laboratory tests for neonatal conjunctivitis includes following:
- Conjunctival scraping for Gram stain or Giemsa stain.
- Conjunctival scraping for polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR).
- Culture on chocolate agar and/or Thayer-Martin medium.
- Culture on blood agar.
- Culture of corneal epithelial cells, if involved.
Laboratory tests specific for suspected infectious aetiology include:
Chlamydial conjunctivitis:
- Conjunctival scraping for Gram stain and Giemsa stain. Conjunctival scraping is taken and eye exudate is not enough to look for Chlamydial conjunctivitis (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis), since the causative agent is obligate intra-cellular parasite.
- Conjunctival scraping for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Gonococcal conjunctivitis:
- Culture on chocolate agar or Thayer-Martin medium for bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
- Conjunctival scraping for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Miscellaneous non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal bacterial conjunctivitis:
- Culture on blood agar for the causative agent.
Herpes simplex conjunctivitis:
- Culture for Herpes simplex virus (HSV).
- Direct fluorescent antibody test.
- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Repeat cultures may be required if symptoms worsen or recur following treatment.

Transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) test is a nucleic acid amplification test like PCR. TMA and PCR are more sensitive than culture in detecting chlamydial and gonorrhoeal organisms.

Cytological findings for various forms of neonatal conjunctivitis are:
- Chemical conjunctivitis: Gram stain shows neutrophils with occasional lymphocytes.
- Chlamydial conjunctivitis: 
Gram stain: Gram stain shows neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells.
Giemsa stain: Giemsa stain shows basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions in epithelial cells.
- Gonococcal conjunctivitis: Gram stain shows neutrophils and Gram-negative intracellular diplococci.
- Miscellaneous non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal conjunctivitis: Gram stain shows neutrophils and infective bacteria.
- Herpes simplex conjunctivitis: 
Gram stain: Gram stain shows lymphocytes, plasma cells and multinucleate giant cells.
Papanicolaou smear: Papanicolaou smear shows eosinophilic intra-nuclear inclusions in epithelial cells, but with low sensitivity.
Neonatal conjunctivitis should be differentiated from:
- Congenital obstruction of nasolacrimal duct.
- Dacryocystitis.
- Bacterial keratitis.
- Fungal keratitis.
- Preseptal cellulitis.
- Orbital cellulitis.
- Congenital glaucoma.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Prior to birth, obtain cervical (lower part of uterus) culture if indicated, to exclude the risk of transmission of chlamydial, gonococcal, herpetic and other bacterial organisms to the foetus during vaginal delivery. Infection should be managed appropriately or the newborn may be delivered through Caesarean section.
Preliminary management pending culture is based on clinical picture and findings on Gram stain, Giemsa stain and Papanicolaou smear.
Since gonococcal conjunctivitis can infect an intact corneal epithelium and may progress rapidly leading to ulceration, prompt treatment is necessary. Infants with acute neonatal conjunctivitis should be treated for gonococcal conjunctivitis and is later modified based on the culture report.
The treatment prior to laboratory result includes topical erythromycin and systemic cephalosporin.
Newborns with conjunctivitis having systemic manifestations or who are at risk of secondary infections such as pneumonia, meningitis or septicaemia should be treated intensively.
Infants and parents with potential sexually transmitted diseases, such as Chlamydia and Gonococcus, should be examined for other sexually transmitted diseases such as Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis.
Patching of eyes should not be done.
Chemical conjunctivitis:
Usually no treatment is necessary for chemical conjunctivitis.
Eye lubrication with artificial tears may be sufficient for mild features.
Chlamydial conjunctivitis:
Topical treatment alone is not sufficient.
Topical and systemic erythromycin is prescribed.
Systemic therapy is important in chlamydial conjunctivitis since topical therapy does not eradicate bacteria in nasopharynx, which may cause life-threatening pneumonia. Since the efficacy of systemic erythromycin is about 80%, a second course is required sometimes.
Infants are treated on outpatient basis but hospitalisation may be required in severe cases.
Gonococcal conjunctivitis:
- Topical irrigation with normal saline to remove profuse mucopurulent or purulent eye discharge.
- Systemic penicillin or ceftriaxone is needed.
- Local application of erythromycin is given.

Hospitalisation may be required.
All neonates with gonococcal conjunctivitis are also treated for chlamydia. Both parents should be treated as well.
Miscellaneous non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal bacterial conjunctivitis:
- Antibiotics such as gentamicin, tobramycin or ciprofloxacin may be used for Gram negative organisms and bacitracin may be used for Gram positive organisms.
Herpes simplex conjunctivitis:
- Systemic acyclovir is prescribed to reduce the risk of systemic infection.
- Topical anti-viral agents such as trifluridine eye drops, ganciclovir gel or vidarabine eye ointment may be prescribed.
- Topical antibiotics may be needed in cases with significant epithelial defects to prevent secondary bacterial infections.

Prognosis:
Prognosis of neonatal conjunctivitis is generally good as long as early diagnosis is made and prompt medical therapy is instituted.
Most cases of infectious neonatal conjunctivitis respond to appropriate therapy.
Morbidity and mortality increases in cases of systemic manifestations requiring hospitalisation and intensive monitoring."
Neurotrophic Keratopathy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/neurotrophic-keratopathy,"Neurotrophic keratopathy (NK), Neurotrophic keratitis or Trigeminal neuropathic keratopathy is a rare degenerative corneal disease. It is characterised by lack of or decreased corneal sensation, corneal epithelial breakdown and impaired healing, resulting into increased susceptibility of the corneal surface to injury and compromised healing. In severe cases this can lead to stromal melting, corneal ulceration and even perforation.
Magendie (1824), first described this disease. Neurotrophic keratopathy was initially described as “neuroparalytic keratitis” and experimentally demonstrated by Magendie, who hypothesized the presence of trophic nerve fibers in the trigeminal nerve regulating tissue metabolism.
A decrease or absence of corneal sensation is the hallmark of neurotrophic keratopathy (Groos Jr EB, 1997).
Corneal sensitivity is controlled by trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve). Corneal nerves also provide trophic (nutritive) support and play a key role in maintaining anatomical integrity and function of the cornea, particularly of epithelium (Mϋller LJ et.al. 2003).
The cornea is supplied by the long ciliary nerve, derived via the nasociliary nerve from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. Any localised ocular or systemic condition which affects the nerve function along this course of the nerve (from trigeminal nucleus to the corneal nerve endings) can create corneal anaesthesia, resulting into neurotrophic keratopathy.
The cornea is one of the most richly innervated parts of the body. Corneal innervation not only provides sensations but is important in the maintenance of structure and function of the cornea. Normal innervation helps to regulate epithelial integrity, proliferation and wound healing of cornea.
The management of neurotrophic keratopathy is one of the most difficult and challenging task. Aim of therapy in neurotrophic keratopathy is prevention of disease progression, preservation of globe integrity and promotion of ocular surface repair. Prompt and aggressive treatment is important to prevent serious complications like infection, corneal ulceration, and perforation.","Patients commonly do not complain of ocular surface symptoms, since corneal sensory innervation is compromised in neurotrophic keratopathy. Therefore, patients may not seek medical advice for months or even years after the onset of the disease.
Sometimes patient may complain of blurred vision due to:

Irregular epithelium,
Scarring,
Corneal oedema or
Persistent epithelial corneal defects.

Corneal scarring may also lead to symptoms of ocular surface discomfort.","The causes of neurotrophic keratopathy are all those conditions that decrease sensitivity of cornea. The most common are herpes infections of the cornea, surgery for trigeminal neuralgia, and surgery for acoustic neuroma.
Various causes and associations of corneal anaesthesia are:
Fifth cranial nerve palsy:

Intracranial: Aneurysms, neoplasms, stroke.
Iatrogenic: Surgery for acoustic neuroma or trigeminal neuralgia.
Genetic: Familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome), Goldenhar-Gorlin syndrome, Möbius syndrome, familial corneal hypoaesthesia, or congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.
Facial trauma.

Ocular:

Viral infections: Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster.
Toxicity: Chemical injury, toxic keratopathy due to drugs, chronic topical anaesthesia abuse.
Iatrogenic: Refractive laser surgery e.g. laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), trauma to ciliary nerves via laser or surgery, corneal incisions.
Contact lens wear.
Chronic ocular surface injury.
Ocular inflammation.
Dark colour of eyes.
Increasing age.
Adie syndrome.
Thermal injury.
Orbital neoplasia.
Corneal dystrophies: Lattice, Granular.

Systemic:

Diabetes mellitus.
Vitamin A deficiency.
Leprosy.
Multiple sclerosis.


Pathogenesis:
Corneal nerves are derived from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, and to a lesser degree from the maxillary nerve. The limbus and peripheral cornea also receive autonomic sympathetic innervations from the superior cervical ganglion. Disruption of sensory and sympathetic pathways is thought to lead to decreased cell division.
Nerves enter middle third of corneal stroma and run forward anteriorly in a radial fashion towards the center, where they lose their myelin sheath approximately 1mm from the corneal limbus. Stromal nerves form the sub-epithelial nerve plexus between Bowman’s layer and the anterior stroma. They perforate Bowman’s layer and form the sub-basal epithelial nerve plexus, providing innervations to the basal epithelial cell layer and terminate within the superficial epithelial layers. Thin branches of sub-epithelial plexus ascend and penetrate Bowman’s layer, bending almost at a right angle to form the sub-basal nerve plexus at the basal epithelial cell layer.
The density of the sub-basal nerve plexus is reduced in NK and several predisposing disease states, including diabetes mellitus and viral keratitis. Reduced density of sub-basal nerves alters the concentration of several neuromediators and growth factors on the ocular surface. These neuromediators maintain a healthy ocular epithelial surface, in addition to altering rate of tear production. These include substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, gelatine, methionine-enkephalin and acetylcholamine. Tear gland also helps in maintaining a healthy ocular surface epithelium by providing growth factors and other nutrients.
Deficiency in neuromediator reduces mitosis rates in epithelial cells, leading to epithelial thinning and surface breakdown. Limbal stem cells fail to replace central epithelium, resulting in a persistent epithelial defect. There is also a reduction in microvilli on the epithelial surface, causing poor adherence of tears to the cornea. Reduction of goblet cell density within conjunctival epithelium also alters tear composition.
Nerve growth factors (NGF) are mediators known to be essential for development and maintenance of both sympathetic and sensory nerves. NGF also produces acetylcholine and substance P. The cornea and conjunctiva have specific nerve fiber receptors that maintain normal corneal nerve density and help in preservation of the epithelium.
Normally a bidirectional interaction occurs between epithelial cells and nerve endings. Reduced corneal sensations render the corneal surface vulnerable to occult injury and decreased reflex tearing. It also appears to decrease healing rates of epithelial injury resulting in non healing epithelial defects.
Consequently, corneal sensory nerve damage impairs the neuromediator- epithelium interactions, which leads to impairment of epithelial maintenance and physiological renewal, and the development of recurrent or persistent epithelial defects.","Diagnosis of neurotrophic keratopathy is based on the clinical history, findings and evaluation of corneal sensitivity. Testing of corneal nerve sensitivity and imaging of corneal nerves aid in the management of NK patients who cannot have corneal transplantation.
Clinical history:
Clinical history should include causes that can cause local injury to corneal sensory nerves (chronic topical drug or anaesthetic abuse, previous ocular trauma or surgery, chemical injury or use of contact lenses), therapies that can cause impairment of trigeminal innervations (antihistamine, antipsychotic, and neuroleptic drugs), systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, and congenital diseases. Brain neoplasms and vascular accidents may damage the fifth cranial nerve or its nucleus.
Clinical presentation:
Impairment of corneal sensation due to damage of trigeminal nerve leads to NK, which is characterised by ocular surface disorders such as:

Superficial punctate keratopathy.
Dryness of cornea.
Cloudy corneal epithelium.
Corneal oedema.
Recurrent and/or persistent epithelial defects of cornea.
Stromal melting.
Corneal ulcers.
Corneal perforation.
Decreased blink rate.
Tear film instability with decreased tear film break up time (BUT).

Based on the severity of corneal damage, Mackie (1995) classified neurotrophic keratopathy into three stages:
Stage 1: It is characterised by-

Superficial punctate keratopathy.
Rose bengal staining of the inferior conjunctiva.
Increased viscosity of tear mucous.
Decrease in tear film break up time (BUT).
Epithelial hyperplasia and irregularity.
Superficial neovascularisation of cornea.
Stromal scarring.
Scattered small facets of dry epithelium (Gaule spots).
Dellen (saucer-shaped thinning in peripheral cornea) formation.

Stage 2: It is characterised by-

Epithelial defects, usually in the superior half of cornea with smooth and rolled edges.
Surrounding rim of loose, poorly adherent opaque and oedematous epithelium around the epithelial defect.
Stromal oedema.
Descemet membrane folds.
Inflammatory reaction in anterior chamber.

Stage 3: It is characterised by-

Corneal ulcer.
Stromal melting.
Perforation of cornea.

Clinical findings:
Cranial nerve examination:
Examination of cranial nerves two to eight, including assessment of other divisions of the trigeminal (fifth cranial) nerve, may help in localising the site of underlying pathology causing corneal anaesthesia. Paresis of the third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves may indicate an aneurysm or cavernous sinus involvement that also affects the trigeminal nerve. Dysfunction of the seventh and eighth cranial nerve may indicate damage from acoustic neuroma or its surgical removal. Suspicion of cranial nerve diseases warrant blood tests for diabetes mellitus, hypervitaminosis A and imaging of brain and/ or orbit.
Orbital and adnexal examination:
Orbital and adnexal examination assesses the protection offered to the ocular surface by the eyelids.

Over exposure of cornea: Over exposure of cornea may lead to dry ocular surface that may accelerate breakdown of the corneal epithelium.
Thyroid eye disease: Previous thyroid eye disease may produce lid retraction and proptosis.
Blepharitis: Blepharitis may cause inflammation of ocular surface.
Trigeminal nerve: Previous surgery or trauma to trigeminal nerve.
Seventh cranial nerve palsy: Seventh cranial nerve palsy may produce lagophthalmos and corneal exposure.
Blink rate: Blink rate reduction may result in failure to distribute tears evenly over the ocular surface. This may lead to secondary dryness and exposure of cornea.

Tear film evaluation:
Tear film may be quantitatively and qualitatively affected by the reduction of corneal sensitivity.

Schirmer’s test: Schirmer’s test evaluates tear production.
Tear film break up time (BUT): Tear film break up time (BUT) evaluates tear film stability.

Ocular examination:

Conjunctiva: Conjunctiva may show Bitot spots, which are associated with hypovitaminosis A.
Anterior chamber: Anterior chamber activity may lead to corneal anaesthesia due to uveitis associated with chronic inflammatory disease.
Dilated ocular fundus examination: Dilated ocular fundus examination may reveal diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve pallor or oedema due to raised intracranial pressure produced by an intracranial tumour.
Cornea: Corneal examination under slit lamp (biomicroscopy) should be conducted for assessment. Vital stains such as fluorescein sodium, rose bengal or lissamine green may be used to visualise ocular surface. Corneal examination may reveal-

- Stromal scars from previous keratitis resulting in ocular anaesthesia.
- Evidence of previous LASIK.
- Corneal epithelial defects.
- Any asymptomatic corneal dystrophy.
- Secondary bacterial infection.
Corneal sensitivity evaluation:
Corneal sensitivity evaluation is vital test to confirm the diagnosis of NK. Assessment of corneal sensitivity may be useful to assess the severity of corneal nerve impairment. A difference in corneal sensitivity in different quadrants of the cornea may indicate a local cause for anaesthesia, such as viral keratitis. It can be measured:
Qualitatively: By touching the central and peripheral part of cornea with a wisp of sterile cotton swab.
Quantitatively: By a corneal aesthesiometer.

Cochet- Bonnet aesthesiometer: Cochet- Bonnet aesthesiometer quantifies corneal sensitivity by the length of a nylon filament required to initiate a blink reflex or a patient response.
Non-contact aesthesiometer: New non-contact aesthesiometer allow the evaluation of chemical, mechanical and thermal sensitivity of the ocular surface. Belmonte non-contact aesthesiometer stimulates central cornea with a series of pulses of warmed air at multiple pressures. The lowest airflow that is able to elicit a response is identified as the mechanical threshold. The chemical detection threshold is assessed by stimulating the central cornea with a mixture of air and various concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the flow restricted to below mechanical detection threshold. Thermal sensitivity threshold is assessed by changes in temperature of airflow.

In vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCM):
In vivo corneal confocal microscopy is a rapid and non-invasive imaging method, which provides understanding of corneal nerve morphology in health and in ocular and systemic diseases.
ICVM studies showed a significant decrease in number of sub-basal nerve fibers, and their density significantly correlates with reduced corneal sensation.
Histological findings:
Histological findings in neurotrophic keratopathy may show:

Decrease in epithelial thickness with loss of surface desquamating layer.
Reduction of surface cell microvilli.
Intracellular swelling of remaining surface epithelial cells.
Areas of abnormal basal lamina.
Decreased density of conjunctival goblet cells.
Increased length of surface microvilli.

Impression cytology:
Impression cytology may be necessary to rule out limbal deficiency of stem cells. Corneal epithelium is positive for cytokeratin 3 and negative for cytokeratin 19, while conjunctival epithelium is negative for cytokeratin 3 and positive for cytokeratin 19. If impression cytology from limbal area shows significant cytokeratin 19 (indicate conjunctival epithelium) and little cytokeratin 3 (indicate corneal epithelium), then the impression cytology would indicate limbal stem cell deficiency.
Neurotrophic keratopathy should be differentiated from other ocular conditions with similar manifestations, such as:
Neurotrophic keratopathy may have a similar clinical appearance to other ocular surface disorders at each clinical stage. History is often helpful in diagnosis towards NK and the presence of an anaesthetic cornea on clinical assessment is a critical sign.
Stage 1 NK: Features such as superficial punctate keratopathy and tear film abnormalities may be observed in diseases like:

Dry eye disease.
Exposure keratopathy.
Topical drug toxicity.
Contact lens related disorders.
Mild chemical injury.
Blepharitis.
Corneal limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD).

Clinical history, clinical features and laboratory tests help in identifying the correct diagnosis, since all of these conditions may be associated with impairment of corneal sensation.
Later stages of NK: Presence of corneal ulcers warrants exclusion of other causes, including immune and infectious, which are always present with ocular inflammation and stromal infiltration. Aetiologies to be excluded are:

Infective corneal ulcer: A microbiological examination is performed to exclude viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.
Inflammatory corneal ulcer: Immune analysis for the presence of systemic autoimmune disease may be considered for an inflammatory ulcer.
Toxic-related corneal ulcer: History of topical therapy is necessary for a toxic-related corneal ulcer. Any local treatment should be discontinued to exclude drugs as the cause of toxic-related corneal ulcer.
Traumatic epithelial defect: A history of trauma, even a mild injury, would be suggestive of a traumatic epithelial defect.
Recurrent corneal erosion: Patients with recurrent corneal erosion may also give history of trauma.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Neurotrophic keratopathy is one of the most difficult and challenging ocular diseases that lacks specific treatment, since no medication can improve corneal sensitivity.
Till date, the treatment of NK is still conservative and any surgical procedure aimed at restoring corneal transparency should be discouraged because of the high risk of developing corneal epithelial defect, melting, ulcers, and perforation after surgery.
The primary aim of treatment is to protect the corneal surface and to promote epithelial re-growth. Treatment must begin early to prevent the progression of corneal damage and promote epithelial healing. Specific measures taken are based on the clinical stage of the disease at the time of presentation and severity of anaesthesia.
Stage 1 disease: Therapy in stage 1 disease aim at improving epithelial quality and transparency to avoid epithelial breakdown. A review of concurrent topical and systemic medications should be undertaken to minimise the use of therapies that might predispose to NK. Ideally, stage 1 disease requires discontinuation of all topical preparations. Other ocular surface associated diseases such as dry eye disease, exposure keratopathy and limbal stem cell deficiency disease, may require specific treatment.
Medical therapy:

Topical artificial tears: To protect corneal epithelium and to minimise ocular surface irritation from long-term use, preservative-free topical preparations are considered for lubrication. Other topical preparations, if used for pre-existing ocular co-morbidity, may also be obtained preservative-free.
Eyelid hygiene: Eyelid hygiene and treatment of blepharitis improves meibomian gland function and reduces the risk of secondary infection.
Oral doxycycline: Oral doxycycline may be used to treat blepharitis and reduce tear concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs have been implicated as a contributing factor of the surface epithelium failing to heal in recurrent corneal erosion syndrome.
Bandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens was previously used as a temporary measure to protect the corneal surface. Bandage contact lens may introduce infection and be a risk factor for secondary infective keratitis.
Punctal plugs: Punctal plugs may be considered to block punctum, in order to increase tears on the ocular surface.

Surgical therapy:

Surgical correction: Any exposure of the corneal surface, secondary to either an eyelid defect or lid malposition, should be corrected by surgical means.
Limbal stem cell transplantation: Limbal stem cell transplantation may be considered in patients of NK with associated co-morbid condition of LSCD to improve the prognosis.

Stage 2 disease: Epithelial defects should be treated to prevent the development of corneal ulcers, promote healing, and prevent the recurrence of corneal breakdown. All topical treatment for other ocular conditions should be discontinued, as there is significant risk of stromal lysis and perforation of ocular globe. While the mainstay of topical therapy is lubrication, there are several adjunctive topical therapies available to promote both corneal epithelial and nerve re-growth. Use of adjunctive therapy may be performed in combination with punctal plugging or a bandage contact lens.
Medical therapy:

Topical artificial tears: Like stage 1 disease, preservative-free topical artificial tears may be used to improve corneal surface.
Topical collagenase inhibitors: Topical collagenase inhibitors (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) may be considered to prevent stromal lysis and globe perforation.
Topical autologous serum eye drops: Treatment with topical autologous serum eye drops has been shown to promote epithelial regeneration and increase nerve density in the sub-basal plexus.
Umbilical cord serum eye drops: Umbilical cord serum eye drops have also been shown to promote healing like topical autologous serum eye drops in a similar manner. Both preparations have been found to have significantly higher concentrations of neuromediators that play a role in corneal epithelial healing than human tears.
Neuromediator preparations: Neuromediators and growth factors may represent a future therapeutic approach for the treatment and prevention of neurotrophic keratopathy. Preparations of individual neuromediators such as substance P in combination with insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factors, fibronectin and nerve growth factors, have been tried as a treatment of NK.
Injection of botulinum toxin A: Injection of botulinum toxin A into the levator muscle induces temporary ptosis, and may be considered as an alternative to lateral tarsorrhaphy.

Surgical therapy:

Lateral tarsorrhaphy: A lateral tarsorrhaphy may be performed to reduce the palpebral aperture, and thus the corneal exposure.
Palpebral spring: Palpebral spring may be used for the eyelid levator to reduce the palpebral aperture thereby preventing corneal exposure.
Amniotic membrane transplantation: Multilayered amniotic membrane transplantation may be utilised, more so in the management of refractory neurotrophic corneal ulcers. It is effective in promoting corneal epithelial healing and in reducing ocular surface vascularisation and inflammation.
Corneal neurotisation: In cases of unilateral NK, surgical replacement by corneal neurotisation of the dysfunctional nerve has been described. Branches of the contra-lateral supra-orbital and supratrochlear nerves may be attached at the limbus of the anaesthetic cornea.


Associated ocular surface conditions also require treatment. Intensive preservative-free antimicrobial therapy is used for secondary bacterial keratitis. Topical corticosteroids reduce inflammation, but it requires close observation, as there is significant risk of precipitating stromal lysis and ocular globe perforation.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated due to their potential of causing corneal melting as a side effect from their anaesthetic properties.
Stage 3 disease: In stage 3 disease, the cornea is at significant risk of perforation. This requires immediate intervention to stop stromal lysis and prevent the perforation. In such cases, preservation of the globe integrity rather than preservation of vision takes precedence. Like stage 1 and stage 2, avoid toxic effects of topical preparations and only preservative-free topical artificial tears and prophylactic topical antibiotics may be used.
Medical therapy:

Topical artificial tears: Like stage 1 and stage 2 diseases, preservative-free topical artificial tears may be used to improve corneal surface.
Topical collagenase inhibitors: In cases of corneal melting, topical collagenase inhibitors, such as N-acetylcysteine or medroxyprogesterone may be used.
Corneal cyanoacrylate glue: Corneal cyanoacrylate glue application followed by insertion of a bandage contact lens may be used in the presence of small corneal perforations.

Surgical therapy:

Conjunctival flap: Conjunctival flap may restore ocular surface integrity and provide metabolic and mechanical support for corneal healing. This is effective for the treatment of chronic corneal ulceration with or without corneal perforation.
Amniotic membrane transplantation: In addition to other measures, multilayered amniotic membrane transplantation may be done to protect corneal surface.
Lateral Tarsorrhaphy: Lateral tarsorrhaphy is also effective in promoting corneal healing, but it provides a poor cosmetic outcome and visual function is sacrificed.
Lamellar and penetrating keratoplasty: Both lamellar and penetrating keratoplasty may be used for larger corneal perforations. As cases of NK are characterised by altered innervations and there is invariably limbal neovascularisation, perfoming keratoplasty is associated with a high failure rate and recurrence of an epithelial defect.
Boston keratoprosthesis (Kpro): Boston keratoprosthesis (Kpro) may be an alternative to keratoplasty in the treatment of an anaesthetic cornea, but the risk of device extrusion from keratolysis and inflammation must be considered prior to Kpro surgery.

Prognosis:
It is important to stress to the patient to have frequent eye examination, since the disease often lacks signs and symptoms, and protection with preservative-free artificial tears to prevent epithelial breakdown is necessary.
Prognosis of neurotrophic keratopathy depends upon:

Specific cause behind impairment of corneal sensitivity.
The duration of the condition.
Degree of corneal anaesthesia or hypoesthesia.
Association with other ocular surface disorders such as dry eye disease, exposure keratopathy and limbal stem cell deficiency.

Prognosis of congenital NK is usually poor since no effective medical therapy is available. Most of the patients are likely to end up developing alterations in ocular surface or disease complications.
Usually more severe the corneal sensory impairment, higher is the rapidity of disease progression towards stromal lysis/ melting, perforation and loss of sight due to anatomical loss of the eye or permanent loss of corneal transparency.
Presence of associated ocular surface disease may affect the prognosis.
Even in patients that do not have complete corneal anaesthesia or associated disease, sometimes even with timely appropriate therapy, neurotrophic keratopathy may may still progress to stage 3 (e.g. corneal ulcer). Neurotrophic corneal ulcer requires prompt treatment to stop stromal lysis and corneal perforation. Corneal ulcer may develop permanent diminution of vision from ensuing corneal scarring and astigmatism, even if there is no perforation."
Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy and Hyperemesis gravidarum,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy-and-hypere,"Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition during early pregnancy. Around half of all pregnant women experience vomiting, andmore than80% of womenexperience nausea in thefirst12 weeks. It is often called morning sickness as the symptoms are usually worse in the morning but can occur at any time of the day, and sometimes continue throughout the day.
Nausea and vomiting typically commence around weeks 8 or 9 of pregnancy and subside after 12–14 weeks. However, in 10% of pregnancies symptoms may continue beyond 20 weeks and even until birth.
Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is not usually causing any adverse effects to developing fetus but can impair the daily routine/ activities of a pregnant woman.
Adequate oral hydration and avoidance of dietary triggers are often sufficient to control the symptoms, but a proportion of women with severe and protracted nausea and vomiting need medical treatment.
Hyperemesis gravidarum: In about .3 to 3 % of pregnant women, severe form of nausea and vomiting can result in to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). It can lead to dehydration, weight loss and electrolyte imbalance and often requires hospitalization. HG is associated with a higher incidence of low birth babies (LBW), small-for gestational age (SGA) and premature babies.","Symptoms of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are variable from woman to woman in its severity, such as from decreased appetite to low level nausea and vomiting. Pregnant woman is still able to eat and drink fluids some of the time with these symptoms.
Symptoms are peak at about 9 weeks of pregnancy and diminish as gestation advances; for most women symptoms resolve by the end of first trimester.
In about 0.3 to 3% of pregnant women, the condition may be severe and progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum. Symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum include-

Severe, persistent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy
Increased salivation than normal
Weight loss (of more than 5% of pre-pregnancy body weight)
Signs of dehydration such as dark urine, weakness, lightheadedness or fainting, dry skin
Inability to take in adequate amount of food
Constipation","The exact cause of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is not known. However, it is believed that rapidly rising blood level of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone released by the placenta during pregnancy may cause morning sickness.
Women who have previously suffered from nausea and vomiting in pregnancy are more likely to have symptoms in a subsequent pregnancy.
Mild morning sickness is common. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is less common but more severe. HG can occur in any pregnancy but conditions with increased placental mass such as molar pregnancy and multiple gestations (twins or more babies) are associated with a higher risk for hyperemesis gravidarum.","Medical history, symptoms and physical examination and pregnancy test are sufficient to diagnose nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). Sometimes it is important to rule out other medical reasons for vomiting in a pregnant woman with HG or if nausea and vomiting occur with following symptoms-

Nausea and vomiting that occurs for the first time after 9 weeks of pregnancy                               
Abdominal pain or tenderness
Fever
Headache

Certain diseases such as gastritis, peptic ulcer, hepatitis, cholecystitis, appendicitis, pancreatitis, and migraine may be considered during differential diagnosis for HG.
The following laboratory tests may be done to assess dehydration

Complete blood count, hematocrit
Serum Electrolytes
Urine analysis for ketones

Pregnancy ultrasound is used to diagnose multiple pregnancy and molar pregnancy.","For nausea and vomiting in pregnancywomen may usually not seek help because of concerns about the safety of medications. However, the experts note that treating nausea and vomiting early in pregnancy, before it progresses, can help control symptoms and prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization. Management includes non-pharmacologic therapies and pharmacologic therapies.
Non-pharmacologic therapies-
Sometimes diet and lifestyle changes are sufficient to manage nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. These include-

Avoidance of stimuli that provoke nausea and vomiting such as strong odors, heat and noises that trigger the labyrinthine areas
Dietary counseling about frequent small meals and avoidance of spicy or fatty foods
Use of Ginger (ginger tea made from fresh grated ginger, ginger capsules, and ginger candies)
Try bland foods, (such as the BRATT diet -bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast, and tea)
Drink fluids often
Take a multivitamin that does not contain iron or take folic acid alone in first trimester
Eat light food in morning something like dry toast or a plain biscuit before getting up to avoid moving around on an empty stomach

Pharmacologic therapies-
If diet and lifestyle changes do not help to reduce symptoms, or if there is severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, medical treatment may be needed. When other medical conditions are ruled out, certain medications can be given by medical expert to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy:

Vitamin B6 and doxylamine, both drugs taken alone or together have been found to be safe to take during pregnancy and have no harmful effects on the baby.
Antiemetic drugs (drugs preventing vomiting): If vitamin B6and doxylamine combination is not effective, antiemetic drugs may be prescribed by doctor considering the severity of symptoms and safety of drug to use during pregnancy.
Women who cannot tolerate oral liquids for a prolonged period or who have clinical signs of dehydration should receive intravenous hydration including dextrose and vitamins. Thiamine should be given before dextrose infusion to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy"
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/obsessive-compulsive-disorder,"Have you ever wondered regarding the unusual behaviour of some persons when they do certain acts repeatedly seemingly without any logical reason like someone repeatedly washing hands, cleaning again and again when it is not needed, taking unusually long time like hours in bathing, taking unusually long time like hours in getting ready, extremely particular about things being arranged or about symmetry , or someone reports getting repetitive thoughts that he or she doesn’t want to think for e.g. violent or sexual thoughts or images etc, then the person should get himself or herself evaluated by a psychiatrist as these may be the symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder(OCD).
There are certain other disorders which are quite similar to OCD in having Obsessive preoccupation leading to significant anxiety and certain repetitive behaviours or mental tasks they do to somehow reduce that anxiety and hence they are also recently considered in the obsessive compulsive spectrum of disorders, e.g.

Hoarding disorder (extreme difficulty in parting with possessions)
Body dysmorphic disorder (extreme dissatisfaction with body shape/part etc)
Trichotillomania or hair pulling disorder (Picking up ones hair and sometimes eating them)
Excoriation or Skin picking disorder.

The lifetime prevalence of OCD in general population in 2-3%, that means 2-3 persons in every hundred persons have OCD in their lifetime. It affects men and women equally.
It usually starts at 20 years of age however it can occur at any age including as early as 2 years of age in children.
OCD is often found to occur with other disorders like Depression, Social Phobia and Tourett’s disorder.

Remember OCD is a treatable disorder so seek help as soon as possible if you doubt you or someone you know may be having the symptoms suggestive of it.","Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: It’s a disorder characterised by

Recurrent intrusive thoughts and images (Obsessions) which generate a lot of worry apprehension or fear.
Rituals or behaviour or mental acts done repeatedly (Compulsions) aimed to neutralize or reduce the anxiety.

Happening alone or in combinations
An example would be a person getting repeated thoughts of hands being dirty (Obsession) generating a lot of anxiety leading to repeated act of hand washing(Compulsion) to reduce the anxiety.

A person having OCD experiences severe anxiety and may be found indulging in

Excessive washing or cleaning, repeated checking, extreme hoarding.
Avoiding particular numbers (e.g. Even or odd numbers) or obsession with certain numbers.
Rituals such as opening and closing a door a certain number of times or doing certain other activity a particular number of times.
A person with OCD may also experience preoccupation with and being distressed by repeated sexual, violent or religious thoughts which he/she doesn’t want to think.

These symptoms are often recognized as irrational by the sufferers and they are further distressed by the fact that they fail to stop or control them. They feel alienated and the symptoms consume a lot of their time resulting in severe emotional, social, financial and other difficulties.

These symptoms must be consistent and continuing, consuming more than one hour a day and should not be secondary to any underlying medical disorder or the effect of a drug or substance of abuse, for a definitive diagnosis of OCD to be made.

Body Dysmorphic Disorder: The person suffering from body dysmorphic disorder harbors the idea of a perceived or imagined defect in body shape or shape or any specific part and indulges in repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to preoccupations with perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance. For e.g. a person believing that his/her nose is deviated to one side although no such defect is visible to others.

Hoarding disorder: The person suffering hoarding disorder finds it extremely difficult to part with possessions regardless of their value or utility resulting in emotional, physical social, financial, or even legal problems for the person himself and the family members. It is different from usual hobby some people have to collect certain items, in this disorder, they accumulate a large number of things filling up and cluttering active living areas of the home or workplace to the extent that the place cannot be used for the purpose it was meant for.

Trichotillomania or Hair pulling disorder: A person having hair pulling disorder gets the urge to pull one’s hair and experiences a lot of anxiety if he tries to resist it and a decrease in anxiety when he/she pulls the hair leading to gradual development of a visible loss of hair from the head. Sometimes the person additionally eats up the hair after pulling it. They are often brought to medical attention because of either unexplained loss of hair or stomach pain.

Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder: This disorder is characterized by constant and recurrent picking at your skin resulting in skin lesions. The person fails to control the urge despite trying many times to reduce or stop it. This often results in medical complications like infections, scarring and physical disfigurement.","OCD &amp; related disorders are a result of complex multi factorial Bio-psycho-social causes. They are complex disorders like heart disease or Diabetes mellitus type-1 and the current research says they are a result of complex interaction of genetic, biological, psychological, social and developmental factors. So one can have an OCD and related diorder because of a combination of the following factors.

Imbalance of the certain chemicals in the brain called the neurotransmitters namely Serotonin, Nor-epinephrine and GABA.
Over activity or under activity of certain areas of brain responsible for emotional or mood regulation or generating fear response.
Genetic factors are involved as relatives of patients with OCD have three to five fold increased risk of having OCD or related disorders or Obsessive Compulsive features.
Some research suggests the role of an infection in childhood by Group A beta hemolytic streptococci.
Stressful situations usually result in initiation or increase in symptoms of OCD and related disorders.
Psychoanalytic school sees OCD &amp; related disorders to be related to multiple unconscious psychological conflicts at various developmental stages especially related to anal psychosexual phase of development while behavioral theories suggest Obsessions as a conditioned stimuli while compulsions are developed as learned behaviors to reduce the anxiety induced by the obsessions.","Obsessive Compulsive disorder &amp; related disorders can be diagnosed by

Ruling out any underlying medical condition and any drug or substance of abuse which may give rise to OCD and related disorders like symptoms.
Psychiatric evaluation based on clinical symptoms, detailed history and mental status examination.","Obsessive compulsive and related disorders are treatable and majority of patients lead a quality life with proper and regular treatment.
The management of OCD and related disorders vary as per the specific disorder a person is suffering from, its severity, and patient profile e.g. (age/sex/body weight/social support/psychological mindedness/past history/family history/other physical or mental health disorders patient is suffering from). The outcome of treatment is best when medicines are used along with behavior therapy.
In general the therapeutic management comprises of a combination of
1.Medications: These include various anti anxiety and antidepressant drugs.
SSRIs (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) e.g. Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Sertraline, Paroxetine etc.

These are currently considered the drug of choice for moderate to severe OCD and related disorders.
The dosage used are often higher than what works for Depression or anxiety in general.
They modulate the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain and show their efficacy in 2-3 weeks.
They should only be taken under specialist guidance and any unwanted side effect or worsening of symptoms should be reported immediately.
In general SSRIs are relatively safer drugs as compared to the older antidepressants and the usual side effects are mild and usually self limiting e.g. headache, nausea, heart burn, nervousness etc, but you should immediately talk to your doctor if any unwanted side effect/change is noticed in body or mind.
Patient should never start or stop the medicines on their own as it may lead to worsening of the problem, discontinuation syndrome or even a paradoxical increase in anxiety or suicidal tendency.
Depending on the disease severity the medicine may have to be taken for longer periods.
SSRIs and other antidepressants and anti anxiety medicines are not habit forming drugs.

Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIS). Desvenlafaxine, Venlafaxine, Duloxetin are also antidepressants may be useful in some OCD related disorders as add on therapy.
TCAs (Tricyclic antidepressants) e.g. especially Clomipramine
This is an older antidepressant and once was used to be considered as the drug of choice for OCD and they act on other neurotransmitters as well apart from serotonin. Currently not used as first line drugs but still is quite useful in some patients or sometimes as a second drug at lower dosage to augment the treatment.
Benzodiazepines(BZDs)
Clonazepam, Lorazepam, Etizolam, Diazepam, Oxazepam, Chordiazepoxide.

BZDs are also used to treat OCD and related disorders in the acute and short term. They are often prescribed along with SSRIs to provide short term relief from anxiety till the time SSRIs take their effect.
They are habit forming drugs and have abuse potential so they should be used in the short term under specialist supervision only.

Serotonin dopamine agonists SDAs: e.g. Risperidone is useful in some patients as an add on therapy to augment the treatment or in patients who do not have insight into their OCD and related disorder or have co-morbid psychotic symptoms.
Electro-convulsive therapy ECT: at times can be helpful in patients not responding to medications.
Repetitive Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation rTMS: initial research seems promising in improving symptoms in some patients, more research is needed.
Psychosurgery: Sometimes in extremely treatment unresponsive cases cingulotomy and capsulotomy is helpful, surgery may not cure the condition but it may help it become treatment responsive.
Deep brain stimulation is another technique under research for treatment of OCD.
Others like Buspirone, Bupropion Hydrochloride, Mirtazapine, Valproate, Carbamazepine and Lithium are used as add on medicines in some patients.
Note: The mediations should be taken under specialist guidance and any unwanted side effect or worsening of symptoms should be reported immediately.
2.Psychotherapies
A.Cognitive behavioural therapy: This form of psychotherapy is very effective in the treatment of OCD &amp; related disorders and it involves the therapist using various techniques to help the patient understand and manage the factors that contribute to their disorder. Cognitive errors are corrected and behavioural techniques are used to reduce or stop undesired behaviour and relaxation techniques like deep breathing are used to control the bodily manifestations of anxiety.
B.Supportive psychotherapy: In this psychotherapeutic approach a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques are used to foster a healthy mental state in the patient through a supportive therapeutic relationship with the patient.
C.Family therapy: Family psychotherapy can help family members better understand their loved one's OCD and learn new ways of communication and interaction that do not reinforce the OCD and related disorder and associated dysfunctional behaviours and this in turn ensures treatment compliance and improves the outcome.
D.Group therapy: In this the psychotherapy is done with a group of unrelated individuals all having OCD and related disorder and it’s a very useful way of providing effective treatment and generating support.
Others adjunctive therapies like Music therapy, art therapy and various meditation styles and breathing relaxation techniques can also help some patients in addition to the first line treatment."
Oral Cancer,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/oral-cancer,"Oral cancer, a type of mouth cancer, where cancerous tissues grows in the oral cavity . Oral or mouth cancer most commonly involves the tongue. It may also occur on the floor of the mouth, cheek lining, gingiva (gums), lips or palate (roof of the mouth). Most oral cancers look very similar under the microscope and are called squamous cell carcinoma.
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer. Squamous cells are found in many places around the body, including the inside of the mouth and under the skin.
Less common types of mouth cancer include:

Oral malignant melanoma - where the cancer starts in cells called melanocytes, which help give skin its color
Adenocarcinomas - cancers that develop inside the salivary glands","Symptoms include:

Red or red and white, patches on the lining of mouth or tongue
One or more mouth ulcers that do not heal after three weeks
Swelling in mouth that lasts for more than three weeks
Pain when swallowing (dysphagia)
A persistent pain in the neck
A hoarse voice
Unexplained weight loss
Unusual changes in sense of taste
Pain in ear
The lymph nodes (glands) in neck become swollen","Oncogenes (genes that causes cancer) are activated as a result of mutation of the DNA.
Various risk factors are: Smoking and alcohol
The two leading causes of mouth cancer are smoking cigarettes (or other tobacco products, such as pipes or cigars) and drinking too much alcohol. Both of these substances are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the DNA in cells and lead to cancer. The risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker.
Betel nuts
Betel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin.
They have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. Betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. This risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco.
Due to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic Indian and Sri Lankan communities than in the population at large.
Smokeless tobacco
Smokeless tobacco is a general term used to refer to a range of products, such as:

Chewing tobacco
Snuff – powdered tobacco designed to be snorted
Snus – a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Sweden, which is placed under your upper lip, where it is gradually absorbed into your blood.

Cannabis
Smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of mouth cancer. Regular cannabis smokers may have a higher risk than tobacco smokers because cannabis smoke contains higher levels of tar than tobacco smoke, and tar is carcinogenic.
Human papilloma virus (HPV)
The human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name of a family of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat.
Infection with some types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth and other changes to the cells, which can lead to the development of cancer
Poor oral hygiene
There is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as having tooth decay, gum disease, not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer.","Biopsy
It may be necessary to remove a small sample of affected tissue to check for the presence of cancerous cells. This procedure is known as a biopsy.
Punch biopsy
A punch biopsy may be used if the suspected affected area of tissue is in an easily accessible place, such as your tongue or the inside of your mouth. The area is first injected with a local anesthetic to numb it. The doctor will then cut away a small section of affected tissue and remove it with tweezers. The procedure is not painful, but can feel a little uncomfortable.
Fine needle aspiration (FNA)
A fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a type of biopsy used if it is suspected a swelling in neck is the result of mouth cancer.
Pan endoscopy
A panendoscopy is a procedure used to obtain a biopsy when the suspected tissue is at the back of throat or inside nasal cavities.
The tests that may be used include:

An X-ray
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
A computerised tomography (CT) scan
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan

A PET scan involves injecting a part of your body with a radioactive ‘tracer’ chemical that can be seen on a special camera.","Surgery
For mouth cancer, the aim of surgical treatment is to remove any affected tissue while minimizing damage to the rest of the mouth.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT)
If the cancer is in its early stages, it may be possible to remove any tumors using a type of laser surgery known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves taking a medicine that makes your tissue sensitive to the effects of light. A laser is then used to remove the tumor.
Radiotherapy
It uses doses of radiation to kill cancerous cells. It may be possible to remove the cancer using radiotherapy alone, but it is usually used after surgery to prevent the cancer from reoccurring.
Chemotherapy
It is often used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning."
Osteomyelitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/musculo-skeletal-bone-joints-/osteomyelitis,"Osteomyelitis refers to a bone infection, usually caused by a bacteria. This can result in the destruction of the bone itself. It can be characterized as:

Acute Osteomyelitis
Chronic Osteomyelitis

It is further classified as:

Suppurative osteomyelitis
Acute suppurative osteomyelitis
Chronic suppurative osteomyelitis
Primary (no preceding phase)

Secondary (follows an acute phase)

Non-suppurative osteomyelitis
Diffuse sclerosing
Focal sclerosing (condensing osteitis)
Proliferative periostitis (periostitis ossificans, Garré's sclerosing osteomyelitis)
Osteoradionecrosis","The most common symptoms are bone pain and high fever:
Acute osteomyelitis:
The symptoms of acute osteomyelitis include:

High temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above
Bone pain, which can often be severe
Swelling, redness and warmth at the site of the infection
The affected body part is tender to touch
The range of movement in the affected body part is restricted
Lymph nodes (glands) near the affected body part may be swollen

Symptoms of chronic osteomyelitis:
In cases of chronic osteomyelitis, symptoms usually recur that have been experienced during a previous infection. Symptoms can flare up at any time:

Bone pain
Feeling persistently tired
Pus draining from the sinus tract (a passageway that develops near the infected bone)
Local swelling
Skin changes
Excessive sweating
Chills","It is generally caused due to bacteria especially staphylococcus aureus.
It is generally seen in children and if it is seen in adults it is due to:

Compromised immunity.
Secondary infection with pulmonary tuberculosis.","Physical examination
To confirm a diagnosis of osteomyelitis, doctor may carry out a physical examination of affected body part to check for redness, swelling and tenderness.
Blood test
Patient is also referred for a blood test. This cannot confirm osteomyelitis, but can indicate infection by number of white blood cells in the blood.
Imaging tests
If osteomyelitis is suspected, further imaging testing may be conducted. There are several imaging tests that may be able to detect bone damage caused by osteomyelitis. They include:

X-rays, where low levels of radiation are used to create an image of the affected bone. Though this test is not usually useful for diagnosis if the condition is in the early stages.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, where a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of the affected bone.
Computerized tomography (CT) scan, where a series of X-rays of your affected bone are taken and a computer is used to assemble them into a more detailed three-dimensional image.
Ultrasound scan, where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of the affected bone to highlight any abnormalities

Biopsy
If earlier testing suggests osteomyelitis, it is usually necessary to remove a small sample of bone for further testing. This is known as a biopsy. A biopsy is usually necessary to confirm a diagnosis of osteomyelitis and can help establish the exact type of bacteria or fungus causing your infection. This can be very useful when deciding on the most effective treatment. A biopsy is usually combined with surgery in chronic cases.","In Acute cases: Antibiotics are used as successful line of treatment.
In Chronic cases: With antibiotics and surgery are used as combination therapy. Surgery may be used to remove bone, to drain pus from a wound or abscess, or to remove and replace a joint replacement if it was the cause of infection.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: Non-surgical treatment called hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be useful in treating cases of both acute and chronic osteomyelitis that do not respond to conventional treatment."
Osteoporosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/musculo-skeletal-bone-joints-/osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a bone mineral density of 2.5 standard deviations or more below the mean peak bone mass (average of young, healthy adults) as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The term ""established osteoporosis"" includes the presence of a fragility fracture. It is a medical condition that affects the bones, causing them to become weak and fragile and more likely to break (fracture).
Common form of osteoporosis:

1) Primary Osteoporosis:
Type I: It is also called as postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Type II: Type II or senile osteoporosis occurs after age 75 and is seen in both females and males at a ratio of 2:1.
2) Secondary Osteoporosis:
Secondary osteoporosis may arise at any age and can affect men and women equally.
This form results from chronic predisposing medical problems or disease, or prolonged use of medications such as glucocorticoids, when the disease is called steroid induced or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.","Osteoporosis develops slowly over several years. Sometime a minor fall or sudden impact can cause a bone to fracture. Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip and wrist.
Symptoms include:

Joint pain
Swelling
Loss of height and stooped posture.
Disfigurement
A curved upper back (dowager's hump).
Debilitation","Osteoporosis may be caused due to decrease in density of bones.
Risk Factors:

Women
Women are at greater risk of developing osteoporosis than men. This is because changes in hormone levels can affect bone density. Female hormone estrogen is essential for healthy bones. After the menopause, the level of estrogen in the body falls, and this can lead to a rapid decrease in bone density.
Men
In most of the men who develop osteoporosis, the cause is unknown. However, there is a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps to keep the bones healthy. Men continue to produce this hormone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in men with low levels of testosterone.
Diseases of the hormone-producing glands There are increased chances of Osteoporosis by hormone-related diseases, including:

Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland)
Disorders of the adrenal glands, such as Cushing's syndrome
Reduced amounts of sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone)
Disorders of the pituitary gland
Hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands).

Other things thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include:

Family history of osteoporosis
A low body mass index (BMI) of 19 or less
Long-term use of high-dose corticosteroid treatment (widely used for conditions such as arthritis and asthma), which can affect bone strength
Heavy drinking and smoking
Rheumatoid arthritis","Osteoporosis is often diagnosed after the weakening of the bones has led to a fracture. Diagnosis can be made on suspicion when patient approaches a doctor for any other reason or x-ray is done otherwise and bones appear weak.
Conventional radiography
Conventional radiography is used either alone or in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass preosteoporosis). However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images. The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as dowager's hump.
Dual-energy X-ray
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30–40-year-old) healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a T-score.
Biomarkers
Chemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen protein, an important constituent in bones. Antibodies recognizes the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a way to diagnose osteoporosis. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarkers for osteoporosis.","Lifestyle
Tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis. Cessation of smoking and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended.
Nutrition
Vitamin D and calcium supplements together can result in preventing fractures. However, there is an increased risk of myocardial infarctions and kidney stones with excess of these supplements.
Medications
Bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures. Teriparatide (a recombinant parathyroid hormone) has been shown to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis."
Otitis Media,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/otitis-media,"It is a middle ear infection. Sometimes ear infections can be painful and may even need antibiotics.It is very common in childhood. Most ear infections occur in infants between the age of 6-18 months, though anyone can get an ear infection. For reasons that are unclear they are more common in boys than girls.","Main symptoms of otitis media include:

Earache
A high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or higher
Lack of energy
Slight deafness
Often accompanied with nasal discharge and cough","Otitis media (middle ear infection) is caused when a bacterial or viral infection, such as a cold, spreads into a part of the ear known as the Eustachian tube.
The Eustachian tube is a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose. It has two main functions:

To ventilate the middle ear, helping to maintain normal air pressure. 
To help drain away mucus and other debris from the ear.

An infection in another part of the body can cause the Eustachian tube to become blocked, leading to an infection.
Enlarged tonsils or adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the throat, above the tonsils) may block the Eustachian tube. Adenoids and tonsils can be removed if they cause a persistent or frequently reoccurring ear infection, this is more common in children than in adults.","Tests to be conducted are described below:
Tympanometry
It helps to measures, how the ear drum reacts to changes in air pressure. A healthy ear drum should move easily if there is a change in air pressure. In tympanometry test, a probe placed into ear changes the air pressure at regular intervals while transmitting a sound into the ear. The probe measures how sound reflects back from the ear, and how changes in air pressure affect these measurements. If less sound is reflected back when the air pressure is high, it usually indicates an infection.
Tympanocentesis
It involves draining fluid out of the middle ear using a small needle. The fluid can then be tested for bacteria or viruses that could be responsible for the infection.
CT scans
A computer tomography (CT) scan may be used if it is thought the infection may have spread out of the middle ear. A CT scan takes a series of X-rays and uses a computer to assemble the scans into a more detailed, ‘3D’ image of the skull.
NHP provides an indicative information. For further diagnosis and treatmwnt one should consult your physician.","Antibiotics:
The first line antibiotic treatment is amoxicillin . Among short-course antibiotics, long-acting azithromycin is found more likely to be successful than short-acting alternatives . If there is no improvement after 2–3 days of treatment a change in therapy may be considered.
Tympanostomy tube:
In chronic cases with effusions, insertion of tympanostomy tube (also called a ""grommet"") into the eardrum reduces recurrence rates in the 6 months after placement. Thus tubes are recommended in those who have more than 3 episodes of acute otitis media in 6 month or 4 in a year associated with an effusion.
NHP provides an indicative information. For further diagnosis and treatmwnt one should consult your physician."
Orbital Dermoid,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/orbital-dermoid,"Orbital dermoid is a congenital benign cystic teratoma (choristoma) that originates from aberrant ectodermal tissue. In these tumours, there is embryonic displacement of epidermis to a subcutaneous location along embryonic lines of closure. As two suture lines of skull close during embryonic development, epidermal or dermal elements may pinch off and form cysts. Orbital dermoids are not attached to the skin.
Orbital dermoid may appear as:
Dermoid cyst: Dermoid cysts have a fibrous wall and are lined by keratinised stratified squamous epithelium and contain dermal appendages such as sweat glands, hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Dermoid cyst may be:-
- Superficial dermoid cyst: Superficial dermoid cysts are located anterior to the orbital septum (anatomic boundary between lid and orbital tissue). These are more common than deep dermoid cysts and become apparent during first decade of life.
- Deep dermoid cysts: Deep dermoid cysts are located posterior to the orbital septum. Deep dermoid cysts appear typically in adolescence or adult life.
Epidermoid cyst: Epidermoid cysts, unlike dermoid cysts, do not contain adnexal structures (accessory visual structures) such as hair follicles, sweat glands or sebaceous glands.","Orbital dermoid may present as:
- Painless superotemporal mass in orbit.
- Painless superonasal mass in orbit.
- Mechanical ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid).
- Proptosis (protrusion of eyeball).
-    Diplopia (double vision).","Dermoids are produced due to entrapment of embryonic epithelial nests when foetal suture lines close during embryogenesis.
Fronto-zygomatic suture is the most commonly involved suture.
Dermoids may also involve fronto-ethmoid or fronto-maxillary sutures.","Diagnosis depends upon the presenting history and clinical examination.
Superficial dermoid cyst:
Superficial dermoid cyst presents typically in infancy as an asymptomatic, firm, round localised lesion in upper temporal aspect of the orbit with attachment to fronto-zygomatic suture or in upper nasal aspect with attachment to fronto-lacrimal suture. It may be mobile or affixed to the bone. It may induce granulomatous inflammation in adjacent tissues, if it leaks or ruptures. Large cysts may cause mechanical ptosis.
Deep dermoid cyst:
Deep dermoid cyst present typically in adolescence or adult life with ocular displacement and non-axial proptosis or a mass lesion with indistinct posterior margins. Deep orbital dermoids may be palpable or non-palpable. Some deep dermoids may extend into temporalis fossa or intracranially. These dermoids may be associated with bony defects. Deep dermoids may cause progressive proptosis or diplopia.

Clinical signs: 
Dermoid may show following signs:-
- Palpable mass.
- Non-axial proptosis.
- Ptosis of eye lid.
- Restricted eyeball movements.
- Diplopia may be due to restriction of eyeball movement or due to compression of cranial nerves controlling movement of eyeball viz. IIIrd, IVth or VIth.
- Inflammation.
- Orbito-cutaneous fistula.
- Optic nerve compression leading to reduced visual acuity, colour vision and brightness perception. There may be relative afferent pupillary defect.
Imaging studies:
Radiography:
X-rays may show radiolucent bony defects due to erosion by the cyst. These defects may be large with distinct margins and may show sclerosis.
CT scan:
On CT scan, cyst lumen is generally homogeneous but it can also be heterogeneous depending upon the amount of lipid and keratin within it. Lumen does not show enhancement with use of contrast.
Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI):
MRI shows cystic appearance, internal fat attenuation (on T1 hyperintensity), internal calcification, and fluid levels. Cyst wall shows enhancement but not the lumen with gadolinium based contrast. Dermoids are high in signal intensity on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging.
Ultrasonography:
On ultrasound, dermoid cysts show a smooth contour and variable echogenicity.
Colour Doppler imaging:
Colour Doppler imaging of dermoid cyst shows absence of intralesional blood flow.

Histological features:
Dermoid cyst wall has variable thickness and may be very thin. Cyst may be connected to periorbita by fibrovascular tissue. Epidermoid cysts are lined by epithelial cells. Dermoid cysts contain adnexal tissue such as sebaceous gland and hair follicles. Cyst may contain oily liquid or solid mass, often high in cholesterol. The cysts may be inflamed.
The dermoid cyst should be differentiated from conditions like:-
- Congenital encephalocele.
- Mucocele.
- Dacryocele.
- Lateral dermoid cyst should be distinguished from lacrimal gland tumours.
- Exophthalmos (protrusion of eyeball).
- Compressive optic neuropathy.
- Orbital tumours.
-    Sebaceous gland carcinoma.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical management:
No medical treatment is normally required for an orbital dermoid.
Ruptured dermoid cyst may cause inflammation. Inflammation may be controlled with oral steroids.

Surgical management:
Mainstay of treatment is surgical for dermoid cyst.

Ocular Graft-versus-host Disease,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/ocular-graft-versus-host-disease,"Ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), where an immunologic response by donor cells against host tissues occurs due to incompatibility between the recipient and donor cells. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a common treatment for haematologic, immunologic, metabolic and neoplastic diseases. HSCT is limited due to GVHD, which is a major cause of morbidity following allogeneic HSCT. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers are the most important factors, triggering the immune response and leading to the onset of GVHD.
Types of transplantation depend upon the source of donor cells, though it is covered under the term bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Sources include autologous (from self), syngeneic (genetically identical), and allogeneic (other individual). The donor cells may be harvested not only from bone marrow but also from peripheral blood and blood from the placental cord.
GVHD is an immune response by the donor cells (graft) against the recipient (host), resulting in an immunological attack against organ systems.
Tissues most commonly targeted by donor cells include:

Gastrointestinal system.
Liver.
Skin.
Mouth.
Lungs.
Eyes.

Traditionally, based on the time of onset, GVHD has been characterised as:

Acute.
Chronic.

Acute GVHD occurs within the first hundred days after HSCT, while chronic GVHD occurs after that time. Ocular complications are most commonly associated with chronic GVHD.
This hundred days separation between acute and chronic held true in the myeloablative era (Myeloablative means killing of cells in bone marrow by chemotherapy or radiotherapy), but it was seen that non- myeloablative allogeneic HSCT and reduced intensity conditioning were associated with a two month delay in onset of acute GVHD, while acute and chronic GVHDs were found to present simultaneously in patients treated, for example, with lymphocyte infusions. Thus, with current consensus, it is primarily the clinical manifestations and not the time of onset of symptoms after transplant that determines the classification of GVHD as acute or chronic.
The prevalence of GVHD varies depending upon:

Age.
Donor cell compatibility.
Prophylaxis measures.
Host environment.","Ocular (eye) manifestations vary widely.
Patient may present with ocular symptoms of:

Dryness.
Irritation.
Photophobia.
Blurred vision.
Redness.
Mucoid discharge.

Patients with severe disease frequently demonstrate:

Conjunctival oedema or chemosis.
Pseudo-membrane formation.
Corneal infections.

Serious manifestations include:

Corneal ulceration.
Corneal perforation.
Potentially permanent loss of vision.","Established risk factors associated with the development of GVHD which affect the severity of clinical presentation are:

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch between donor and the recipient.
Gender disparity e.g. male donor for female recipient and vice versa.
Source of the stem cells.
Type of prophylaxis or conditioning regimen undertaken.
Advanced donor and recipient age.
History of acute GVHD (in cases of chronic GVHD).

Optimally HLA- matched transplant recipients may also present with GVHD mainly due to mismatch of potential minor histocompatibility antigens, which are not accounted for in routine typing.

Pathophysiology:
The immune response in GVHD is based on the role of donor T-lymphocytic cells attacking against host tissues. The primary cell responsible for this attack are the donor T-helper type 1 cells in acute GVHD and the donor T-helper type 2 cells in chronic GVHD.
While the mechanism behind chronic GVHD has not been fully elucidated, there is a decreased tolerance to self- antigens and inflammatory reactions in multiple organ systems.
Conjunctivitis is commonly observed as a localised ocular reaction in GVHD. Although the mechanism is not understood, flow cytometry has demonstrated the proliferation of T cells in subconjunctival immunogenic inflammation. Histopathology has revealed lymphocyte exocytosis and satellitosis, dyskeratotic cells, epithelial cell necrosis, sub-epithelial micro-vesicle formation and eventually, total separation of the epithelium in the conjunctiva of patients with GVHD. Epithelial attenuation and goblet cell depletion have also been reported.
In GVHD, donor lymphocytes infiltrate the lacrimal gland, leading to widespread fibrosis and aqueous tear deficiency. Histopathology of the lacrimal gland in patients with chronic GVHD and DES reveals Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) - positive material accumulation in the acini and ductules, predominant T-cell infiltration in periductal areas, increased number and activation of stromal fibroblasts and excessive extracellular matrix fibrosis. There is also prominent fibrosis of the glandular interstitium, similar to the chronic skin GVHD changes with generalised sclera-dermal lichenoid. Autopsy studies of the lacrimal gland in patients with GVHD have shown stasis of lacrimal gland secretions and epithelial cell debris within the lumina. Immunohistochemical studies show primarily CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) and CD8 T-cell infiltration in periductal area of lacrimal glands of patients with chronic GVHD.
Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) can also lead to dry eye symptoms in patients with GVHD. The meibomian gland secretes lipid component of the tear film.","A thorough patient history and ocular examination is necessary for the clinical diagnosis of ocular GVHD. Essential components of the history include extent of systemic GVHD, as well as systemic medications taken.
Ocular GVHD may have clinical manifestations similar to those of autoimmune and collagen vascular diseases affecting the eye, but ocular GVHD does not typically affect the posterior chamber (extremely rare).
Ocular GVHD affects 60-90% of patients with chronic systemic GVHD and may be the initial presentation of systemic GVHD. Ocular manifestations vary widely from mild findings, to severe ocular sequelae and can affect the eyelid, lacrimal gland, conjunctiva, tear film, cornea, lens, vitreous, retina and optic nerve.
Most common presentation includes diseases of the ocular surface and lacrimal gland.
Appropriate diagnosis and management of ocular GVHD is important in order to maintain visual acuity and good quality of life in cases treated with HSCT.
Dry eye syndrome (DES) or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS)occurs in 70% of GVHD patients.
Besides the symptoms of dryness, irritation, blurred vision, photophobia, redness and mucous discharge, patient may have any of the following signs:

Features of dry eye.
Lacrimal gland dysfunction.
Spontaneous lacrimal punctal occlusion (SLPO).
Cicatricial ectropion.
Cicatricial entropion.
Trichiasis.
Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)
Conjunctival inflammation and fibrosis.
Cicatricial lagophthalmos. 
Sterile conjunctivitis.
Conjunctival oedema or chemosis.
Pseudomembrane formation.
Punctate keratopathy.
Corneal epithelial erosions.
Corneal infections.
Chronic filamentary keratitis.
Corneal scarring.
Calcareous corneal degeneration.
Corneal ulceration.
Corneal perforation.
Uveitis.
Synechiae.
Cataract.
Retinal vasculitis.
Retinal haemorrhage.
Optic neuropathy.


Classification:
Multiple classification systems have been used to categorise ocular GVHD.
In 1989, Jabs et al. proposed a clinical staging system for conjunctival involvement in ocular GVHD.
Clinical Staging System for Conjunctivitis in Ocular GVHD (Jabs et al. 1989):

Stage I: Hyperaemia.
Stage II: Hyperaemia with chemosis and/or serosanguineous exudates.
Stage III: Pseudo-membranous/membranous conjunctivitis.
Stage IV: Pseudo-membranous/membranous conjunctivitis with corneal epithelial sloughing.

In 1998, Kiang et al. characterised the course of ocular GVHD into four stages.
Stages of Ocular GVHD (Kiang et al. 1998):

Stage 1 or Subclinical stage: Tearing, mild nonspecific discomfort and photophobia. Mild chemosis, possible rose bengal staining. It lasts from a few days up to 1 month before other systemic symptoms of GVHD occur or the patient progresses to a more severe form of ocular GVHD.
Stage 2 or Active stage: Muco-purulent conjunctivitis. Pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis, punctate keratitis or corneal abrasion. Patients usually have systemic manifestations of GVHD.
Stage 3 or Convalescent stage: Secondary sicca. Irregular eyelid margins with obstructed meibomian gland orifices, tarsal and forniceal scarring and punctate corneal epitheliopathy.
Stage 4 or Necrotising stage: Corneal melting and possible corneal perforation.

An alternative classification system was proposed by Robinson et al. in 2004. In this system, clinically relevant grading criteria for conjunctival GVHD is based on conjunctival pathology, observed in chronic GVHD patients.
Clinical Grading Criteria for Conjunctival GVHD (Robinson et al. 2004):

Grade 1: Conjunctival hyperaemia occurring on the bulbar or palpebral conjunctiva in at least one eyelid.
Grade 2: Palpebral conjunctival fibro-vascular changes occurring along the superior border of the upper eyelid, or the lower border of the tarsal plate of the lower eyelid, with or without conjunctival epithelial sloughing, involving &lt;25% of the total surface area in at least one eyelid.
Grade 3: Palpebral conjunctival fibro-vascular changes occurring along the superior border of the upper eyelid, or the lower border of the tarsal plate of the lower eyelid, involving 25- 75% of the total surface area in at least one eyelid.
Grade 4: Palpebral conjunctival fibro-vascular changes involving &gt;75% of the total surface area with or without a cicatricial entropion in at least one eyelid.


Clinical tests: 

Schirmer test: Schirmer test assists in diagnosis of lacrimal function in chronic ocular GVHD. New onset KCS with Schirmer score of 6-10mm or a symptomatic patient with Schirmer score of ± 5mm in presence of other organ involvement forms the criteria for diagnosis of chronic ocular GVHD.
Ocular surface disease index (OSDI): Ocular surface disease index (OSDI) is shown to be statistically higher in patients with chronic ocular GVHD than in pre-transplant or post-transplant patients without ocular GVHD (Agomo et al. 2008).
Videokeratoscope: Videokeratoscope may be used in the evaluation of patients with higher aberrations in patients of chronic GVHD (Chang-Strepka 2009).


Histopathology: 
Histopathology of the conjunctival biopsy may reveal lymphocyte exocytosis and satellitosis, dyskeratotic cells, epithelial cell necrosis, sub-epithelial micro-vesicle formation and eventual total separation of the epithelium in the conjunctiva of patients with GVHD.

Diagnostic criteria:
The diagnostic criteria for ocular GVHD were established by the National institutes of Health Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic GVHD in 2005. The Diagnosis and Staging Working Group has stated that a mean Schirmer value of 5mm at 5 minutes or new onset of keratoconjunctivitis sicca by slit lamp examination, with a mean Schirmer value of 6- 10mm, is sufficient for the diagnosis of Chronic GVHD, if accompanied by involvement of at least one other organ system.
The NIH Health Consensus Development Project defined findings of new-onset dry, gritty, or painful eyes, cicatricial conjunctivitis, KCS, and confluent areas of punctuate keratopathy, as well as periorbita hyper-pigmentation, difficulty in opening the eyes in the morning because of dried mucoid secretions, and blepharitis as ‘distinctive signs’ (seen in chronic GVHD but insufficient, alone, to establish a diagnosis of chronic GVHD). As per report, a diagnosis of chronic GVHD could be made in the presence of one diagnostic sign or the presence of a distinctive sign (confirmed by biopsy and laboratory testing) and/or distinctive signs in one other organ system. This formed the basis for the addition of two new categories to the existing classification of GVHD: persistent, recurrent, or late-onset acute GVHD (&gt;3 months) and overlap syndrome (no temporal relation) in which features of acute and chronic GVHD appear together. Chronic GVHD based only on ocular findings (presence of one distinctive sign) can be confirmed on the basis of biopsy evidence of KCS or Schirmer test and if accompanied by distinctive manifestations in at least one other organ. Routine screening biopsy serves little benefit for early detection of ocular GVHD. Lacrimal gland biopsy is invasive and risks decreasing the functional capacity of the gland.

Differential diagnosis:
Due to similar clinical features, ocular GVHD should be differentiated from:

Autoimmune diseases.
Collagen vascular diseases.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates collaboration with other medical teams is essential for GVHD patients. This includes collaboration with the haematology and oncology services and stem cell transplantation services.
The management of ocular GVHD includes:
I. Primary prevention
II. Secondary therapeutic approaches which includes medical, both local and systemic, and surgical therapies.
I. Primary prevention:
Prevention of disease plays an important role in decreasing the morbidity associated with ocular GVHD.

Environmental modifications: Environmental modifications and decreased exposure to low-humidity settings may reduce DES symptoms. Cool mist humidifiers can be particularly helpful for environmental modifications at home, including bedside use while sleeping.
Ultraviolet light exposure: Minimising ultraviolet light exposure also helps.
Eye evaluation: Regular eye evaluation may monitor for the development of infection, cataract, and intraocular pressure elevation. Therefore, a thorough ocular exam is recommended prior to HSCT.
Topical cyclosporine: Prophylactic use of topical cyclosporine (0.05%) might also reduce severity of disease.


II. Secondary therapeutic approaches:
1. Systemic medical therapy:

Immunosuppression: Systemic immunosuppressive medications may be effective in preventing manifestations of GVHD, but this benefit must also be weighed against the associated risks of infection, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hypertension, and even death. Agents include tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, methotrexate, sirolimus, antithymocyte globulin, Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy and corticosteroids. These systemic therapies are often reserved for severe or refractory cases, due to long term adverse events with chronic use. First-line treatments are instead targeted towards specific organ systems with ocular immunosuppressive agents. 

2. Local medical therapy:
Successful treatment modalities include eye lubrication, reduction of tear evaporation, minimising ocular surface inflammation, and immunosuppression.
a. Lubrication and Reduction of Tear evaporation:

Preservative-free artificial tears: Preservative-free artificial tears and ophthalmic lubricating ointments are effective approaches in providing lubrication and diluting inflammatory mediators in the tear film.
Punctal occlusion: Punctal occlusion may effectively decrease tear drainage from the ocular surface, with either silicone plugs as temporary measure or permanent thermal cauterisation.
Moisture chamber goggles: Moisture chamber goggles may also prove beneficial in reducing tear evaporation and increasing patient comfort.
Treatment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD): Dry eyes may be exacerbated by dysfunction of Meibomian and Zeis glands, both of which normally serve to produce the outer lipid layer of the tear film. The lipid layer is crucial in minimising evaporation of tears from the corneal surface. Treatment involves:

- Warm compresses.
- Lid Hygiene.
- Oral tetracyclines or azithromycin.
b. Minimising ocular surface inflammation and immunosuppression:

Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroid reduces ocular surface inflammation. The mechanism of action is through lymphocyte apoptosis (programmed cell death without releasing harmful substances into the surrounding area) and blockage of cell-mediated inflammation. Topical steroids are often combined with prophylactic topical antibiotic and tapered to avoid potential side effects. Patient is monitored for corticosteroid-induced side effects. They are contraindicated in patients with infiltrates, epithelial defects or stromal thinning of the cornea.
Topical cyclosporine A: Topical cyclosporine A is an anti-inflammatory drug, which produces local inhibition of T lymphocytes and cytokine production in the conjunctiva. Cyclosporine may minimise destruction of lacrimal gland tissue and reduce dry eye. There may be improvement in corneal sensitivity, tear evaporation rate, tear break-up time, vital staining scores, goblet cell density, conjunctival squamous metaplasia and inflammatory cell numbers after treatment with topical cyclosporine. This has been used primarily in patients of chronic GVHD and KCS with minimal improvement, despite treatment with lubrication and topical steroids.


c. Autologous serum eye drops: Autologous serum eye drops (20-50%) have been used safely and effectively in the treatment of DES in patients with ocular GVHD. Unlike artificial tears, they contain albumin, epidermal growth factor, fibronectin, vitamin A, neurotrophic growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor, all of which may help in maintaining stable tear film. A potential concern with this treatment is the risk of contamination which may produce infection.
d. Scleral contact lenses: Scleral contact lenses have also been used in patients with severe or refractory dry eye disease. These larger contact lenses create a tear-filled vault on the corneal surface without corneal contact. These include Jupiter lenses, as well as the custom-designed PROSE (Prosthestic Replacement of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem) lenses.
e. Mucolytic agents: Mucolytic agents such as acetylcysteine (10%) may be used to treat severe filamentary keratitis.
f. Newer treatment modalities: Newer agents include topical immunomodulator tranilast (rizaben), topical tacrolimus, and retinoic acid, although large scale studies are needed.

3. Surgical therapy:
Surgical therapy may be needed in most severe cases of GVHD where maximal medical therapy may fail in reducing symptoms and protecting the ocular surface.

Tarsorrhaphy: Tarsorrhaphy may be required to protect the ocular surface. Tarsorrhaphy may be performed with suture, glue adhesive, or botulinum toxin. Suture is the best technique as most patients with severe GVHD require a permanent tarsorrhaphy.
Amniotic membrane grafting: Amniotic membrane grafting may be done to protect the corneal surface. Amniotic membrane may be placed with suture or fibrin glue in one or multiple layers, or in conjunction with a carrier, such as with bio-tissue ProKera or AmbioDisc.
Cyanoacrylate glue patching: Cyanoacrylate glue patching may be performed in small descemetoceles or corneal perforations.
Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) may be done for large descemetocele.
Penetrating keratoplasty (PK): Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) may also be performed for large descemetocele. In patients with large corneal perforations, penetrating keraoplasty must be performed on an emergency basis with strong consideration of placement of a concurrent tarsorrhaphy and/or amniotic membrane graft.


Prognosis:
Ocular involvement, though rare in systemic acute GVHD, is considered a poor prognostic factor for mortality caused by systemic acute GVHD. Though known to impair the quality of life and activities of daily living, ocular GVHD usually does not lead to permanent visual loss."
Obesity,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/obesity,"Obesity is a condition where a person has accumulated abnormal or excessive body fat that causes negative effects on health. For an individual, obesity is usually the result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expanded. An increased consumption of high calorie foods, without an equal increase in physical activity leads to an increase in weight. Decreased levels of physical activity will also result in an energy imbalance and lead to weight gain. 
Once it was thought as a problem of high income countries now the problem of overweight and obesity are increasing in low income and middle income countries especially in urban areas. Since 1980 obesity has doubled worldwide. In 2014 more than 1.9 billion adults (18 years and older) and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight. Nearly half of the children under five who were overweight or obese in 2014 lived in Asia.
Overweight and obesity are emerging health problems in India. According to National family health survey India-3 (NFHS-3), thirteen percent of women (15-49 Years) and nine percent of men (15-49 Years) were overweight or obese in 2005-06. Overweight prevalence was higher in urban areas than rural areas and lower in people who are involved in agriculture or manual work.
World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A simple measure commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults is body mass index (BMI). BMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2). WHO identifies overweight when BMI is greater than or equal to 25; and obesity when BMI is greater or equal to 30. In Asians, the cut-offs for overweight (≥23.0kg/m2) and obesity (≥25.0kg/m2) are lower than WHO criteria due to risk factors and morbidities.
Overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight and act as a predisposing factor for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart attack and stroke), diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders (osteoarthritis), some cancers (including breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon).
Obesity during childhood also causes breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, and psychological effects. In later life with high chances of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes can lead to disability and premature death.
Overweight, obesity and their related non-communicable disease are preventable. By making the choice of healthier food and regular physical activity overweight and obesity can be prevented.","Weight gain usually occurs over time. Most people know when they've gained weight. Some of the signs of overweight or obesity include:

Clothes feeling tight and needing a larger size.
Weight gain as compared to previous measurement
Having extra fat around the waist.
A higher than normal body mass index (a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2)) and waist circumference.

Other symptom may be:

Breathlessness
Increased sweating
Snoring
Back and joint pains
Feeling tired even with routine activities
Inability to cope with sudden physical activity
Psychological problems such as low self –esteem, low confidence level
Without proper treatment obesity can lead to various health problems as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis, cancer, infertility, sleep apnea.","Obesity doesn't occur overnight. It develops gradually over time when there is disturbance in energy balance. Energy balance means that “energy in” through food intake and “energy out” through physical activities. Consuming excess calories from high-fat foods, sugars and doing little or no daily physical activity over the long time will lead to weight gain. The reasons for the imbalance between calorie intake and energy out may vary from individual to individual.

Genetics may play a role in conversion of food into energy and how body burns calories during exercise. Genes may affect the amount of fat storage and distribution of fat in body.
Family history- A person is more likely to develop obesity if one or both parents are obese. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families not just because of genetics but family members tend to share similar eating and activity habits. Children’s choices, diet and physical activity habits are influenced by their surrounding environment.
Unhealthy diet- Diet rich in calories (fast foods), high calorie beverages, oversized portions, bad eating habits (eating between meals, preference to sweets, refined foods, and fats), diet lacking with fruits and vegetables; all these factors contribute to weight gain.
Sedentary life style- With a sedentary lifestyle such as sedentary occupation and inactive recreation (watching television) more calories are stored in the body every day than used through exercise. Thus sedentary lifestyle promotes weight gain. If there is any associated medical problems such as arthritis can lead to decreased activity; that contributes to weight gain.
Health conditions- Some medical conditions may cause over weight and obesity because of hormonal disturbances such as hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome and poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

In hypothyroidism there is lack of thyroid hormone that slows down the metabolism and causes weight gain.
PCOS is a condition that affects women of child bearing age. It is often associated with obesity due to high levels of androgens.
In Cushing syndrome there is increased production of cortisol hormone from adrenal glands.

Medicines-Certain medicines such as corticosteroids, antidepressants and medicines used for seizure control may cause weight gain.
Emotional factors- For some people, eating habits are influenced by emotions such as sadness, stress, boredom or anger and they react by eating excessively.
Smoking- Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. However, smoking is a serious health risk, and quitting is more important than possible weight gain.
Age- Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. Infants with excessive weight have increased chances of obesity in later life. As age increases, muscle mass tends to decrease and some hormonal changes also occur; these factors along with less active lifestyle increase the risk of obesity in later age.
Sex-Men have more muscle mass and use more calories (even at rest) than women. Thus, women are more likely to gain weight as compare to men with the same calorie intake; however midlife weight gain in women is mainly due to aging and lifestyle, but at menopause hormonal changes also play a role in weight gain.
Pregnancy- Woman gain weight during pregnancy and, some women find it difficult to lose weight after child birth. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women.
Lack of sleep- Not having enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in hormones that may increase appetite and craving for foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain.
Environment- If environment doesn’t support healthy lifestyle, it encourages obesity. Some reasons include-

Lack of neighborhood sidewalks, parks, and safe places for recreation prevents people to be physically active.
People working with long work hours and time spent commuting don’t have enough time to be physically active.
Lack of access to healthy foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, or, for some people these healthy foods are too costly.
Lack of awareness about healthy diet and healthy cooking practices.
Food advertisements for high-calorie, high-fat snacks and sugary drinks promote people to buy them.


There are two different kinds of distribution of body fat that play a role in determining risk of obesity –related health problems;

excess body fat distributed around the waist (apple-shaped figure, intra-abdominal fat);
excess body fat distributed on the hips and thighs (pear-shaped figure, fat under the skin)

Fat collected around the waist (apple-shaped figure) carries more risk for obesity related health problems.","(a) Assessment of obesity
Height and weight are the most simple and commonly used measures. Overweight and obesity can be diagnosed by calculating body mass index (BMI) of an individual. BMI generally correlates with fat accumulation although it can sometimes misclassify total body fat content as seen in athletes who are muscular, have high BMI due to muscle weighing more than fat and will have BMI within the overweight range even though they are not fat. The adult BMI cut-offs are not considered appropriate for children as they are still growing.
BMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2). BMI (Metric Formula) =Weight in Kilograms/Height in meters2 .
WHO defines overweight when BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0kg/m2; and obesity when BMI is greater or equal to 30.0kg/m2. In Asians, the cut-offs for overweight (≥23.0kg/m2) and obesity (≥25.0kg/m2) is lower than WHO criteria due to risk factors and morbidities.
Waist circumference: It is measured at the midpoint between the lower border of the rib cage and the iliac crest. Waist circumference ≥102 cm in men and ≥88cm in females is associated with an increased risk of metabolic complications.
Waist: Hip ratio (WHR): High WHR (&gt;1.0 in men and &gt;0.85 in women) indicates abdominal fat accumulation.
(b) Obese persons should have a full medical assessment including routine evaluation of co-morbidity such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia. A cardiovascular examination is needed for those older than 40 years or persons having history of heart disease.
(c) Various laboratory tests may be performed to assess co- morbid conditions-

Fasting lipid profile
Liver function tests
Thyroid function tests
Fasting glucose and haemoglobin A1c(HBA1c)","For most people who are overweight or obese, the safest and most effective way to lose weight is setting goals with life style changes such as eating fewer calories and being physically active. If lifestyle changes are not enough then only medicines and weight loss surgery are options. While suffering from any co-morbid condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis consult your physician prior to starting life style changes.
Set realistic goals:

The best way to lose weight is decrease it slowly. A weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds a week is safe and will give the time to adopt new healthy life style changes. Hence 5-10 percent of current body weight can be loosed over six months time.
If a child in the family is overweight or obese the focus should be to encourage him for healthy eating habits and physical activity and if any health condition related to overweight or obesity is present, pediatrician should be consulted.

(a) Life style changes:
Life style changes include healthy eating habits and physical activity.
(i) Healthy eating habits provide body the sufficient nutrients for maintaining good health, but not so many that it causes weight gain.Healthy diet includes:

Limit energy intake from total fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats and towards the elimination of trans-fatty acids. This can be achieved by-

eating fat-free and low-fat dairy products, such as low-fat yogurt, cheese, and milk
avoiding whole milk, whole-milk cheese, cream, butter, and ice cream
avoiding foods containing solid fats(vanaspati ghee, lard, coconut, and palm oils) such as deep fried fast foods
Limiting foods prepared with partially hydrogenated oils (Doughnuts, cookies, crackers, muffins, pies and cakes)
Limiting use of ground beef, sausage, and processed meats

consume whole-grain foods (whole-wheat bread and chapati, oatmeal, and brown rice), legumes and nuts
increase consumption of fruits and vegetables
limit the intake of free sugars
limit salt (sodium) consumption from all sources and ensure that salt is iodized.

Portion size: Cutting back on portion size is a good way to eat fewer calories. Avoid oversized portions. Use a smaller plate, bowl, and glass.
Food weight: Eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food; for example; replacing a full-fat food product that weighs two ounces with a low-fat product that weighs the same. Another helpful practice is to eat foods that contain a lot of water, such as vegetables, fruits, and soups.
Very-low-calorie diet (VLCD): gives less than 800 calories a day. Though these diets can lead to rapid weight loss, butthey aren't a safe method for everyone. VLCDs are only recommended when obesity-related complication would need rapid weight loss.
(ii) Physical activity- This is an important part of weight reducing programme. Regular physical exercise is essential to increase energy expenditure. Few important suggestions are-

Consult the physician before starting physical activity specially those who are having other medical problems along with obesity.
Start physical activity slowly and increase intensity and duration gradually with time. Low to medium intensity is sufficient. It is not necessary to participate in strenuous activity.
Choose activities that you enjoy and that fit into your daily life.
Start activity with doing more everyday activities, such as taking the stairs instead of elevators and doing house hold chores.
The next step is to start walking, biking, or swimming at a slow pace and increase the exercise time, or increase the intensity level of the activity gradually. (Brisk walk, dancing, gardening, and water aerobics are moderate-intensity physical activity).

(iii) Behavioral changes-Changing behaviors or habits related to food and physical activity is important for losing weight such as:

Change the habits promoting weight gain such as watching television for long hours.
Keep a record of your weight loss.
Ask for help or encouragement from friends, family, and health care provider.
Reward the success for meeting weight-loss goals.

(b)Prescription anti-obesity drugs can be useful adjuncts to diet and exercise for obese adults who have failed to achieve weight loss with diet and exercise. Drugs are only prescribed when BMI is 28 kg/m2 or more with other weight related conditions or BMI 30 kg/m2 or more.
(c)Weight loss surgery-also called bariatric surgery, is sometimes used to treat people who are severely obese (for BMI of 35 kg/m2 with co-morbidity or BMI over 40 kg/m2). Common weight-loss surgeries include:

Gastric bypass surgery
Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)
Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch
Gastric sleeve

(d)Vagal nerve blockade is another treatment for obesity. It involves implanting a device under the skin of the abdomen that sends intermittent electrical pulses to the abdominal vagus nerve, which tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. This new technology is used in adults who have not been able to lose weight with a weight-loss programme and who have a BMI of 35 - 45 kg/m2 with at least one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes."
Osteoarthritis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/musculo-skeletal-bone-joints-/osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthrithis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis in both developed and developing countries. It is a chronic, progressive musculoskeletal disorder characterized by gradual loss of cartilage in joints which results in bones rubbing together and creating stiffness, pain, and impaired movement. The disease most commonly affects the joints in the knees, hips, hands, feet, and spine. The disease is associated with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, genetic predisposition, bone density, occupational injury, trauma, and gender.
Osteoarthritis can be classified into two groups primary and secondary. Primary osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease and is related to aging. The water content of the cartilages decreases on increasing age, thus making them more susceptible to degradation. While secondary arthritis usually affects the joints earlier in life due to specific causes such as injury during a job requiring frequent kneeling or squatting for long duration, diabetes and obesity.
Osteoarthritis primarily affects the elderly population. It is a major cause of disability in older adults worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women ageds over 60 years have symptomatic osteoarthritis worldwide. 80% of those with osteoarthritis have limitations in movement, and 25% cannot perform their major daily activities of life.
Osteoarthritis is the second most common rheumatologic problem and it is the most frequent joint disease with a prevalence of 22% to 39% in India. OA is more common in women than men. Nearly, 45% of women over the age of 65 years have symptoms while 70% of those over 65 years show radiological evidence of OA.
The prevalence of OA is increasing due to population ageing and an increase in related factors such as obesity, sedentary life style. The physical disability arising from pain and loss of functional capacity reduces quality of life and increases the risk of further morbidity. As highly effective medicinal management is not available emphasis should be given to preventive aspect of life style measures in the form of healthy diet and exercise.","The main symptoms of OA are pain, loss of ability, and “joint stiffness after exercise or use.” These symptoms are often aggravated by activity or rigorous exercise and relieved during rest. The disease may eventually progress to the point where the patient even feels pain during rest. Some people report pain so intense that it wakes them up when they are sleeping.
Knee or hip pain may lead to reduced physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle that may increase the weight gain and further obesity. Being overweight or obese can lead to the development of diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure.
People with OA have greater chances of fall and fracture than those without OA due to presence of risk factors such as decreased function of joints, muscle weakness and impaired balance.","Risk Factors for occurrence and progression of osteoarthritis-
i) Age- Normal ageing processes cause increased OA progression. Incidence increases with age but stays at the same level around age 80.
ii) Trauma- Injury to collateral ligament, meniscal tears and joint fractures lead to increased risk for OA.
iii) Occupation: OA is more common in those performing heavy physical work, occupational kneeling or repetitive use of joint during work. Certain occupations such as farming, construction work and physical education teaching are risk factors for the development of OA.
iv) Exercise- High impact sports present an increased risk for OA.
v) Genetics- There is genetic susceptibility to the disease; children of parents with early onset OA are at a higher risk of developing OA.
vi)Obesity- It is a strongest modifiable risk factor, being overweight at an average age of 36-37 years is a risk factor for developing knee OA.
vii) Gender and ethnicity- Women are more likely to develop OA than men, especially after age 50. OA is more common in Europeans than in Asians.
viii) Bone density- Decreased bone mineral density is a risk factor for OA","Commonly the doctor can diagnose OA on clinical examination with the following signs and symptoms:

Grating sound during joint movement (crepitations),
joint swelling,
limited range of motion,
tenderness where the joint is pressed,
pain during normal movements.

An X-ray of affected joints will show a loss of the joint space. In more advanced cases, there may be bone spurs or evidence of worn-down ends of the bones in the affected joint.
An MRI scan (Magnetic resonance imaging) may be helpful in distinguishing OA from other kinds of injuries.
Artroscopy: is a common method of diagnosis and monitoring of progression.","Management of the patient with OA should be comprehensive and individualized, taking into account the joint involved, the phase and the progression rate of the disease, co-morbid conditions such as cardiac disease, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease or renal disease, as well as the patient’s needs and expectations. Management plan should be regularly reviewed which is broadly divided into non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical treatments. Non-pharmacological treatments should be started first, followed by pharmacological treatment and then surgery if the first two are unsuccessful.
According to various recommendations, non-pharmacological treatment of OA should include education, exercise, weight reduction and physical aids (such as canes, insoles and knee braces).
Education-
It is reported that patient education in disease management, weight reduction and exercise is quite effective in reducing joint pain. Effective educational techniques include individualized education, group education, social support, patient coping skills, and spouse assisted coping skills (coping skills : enhance patients’ ability to control and decrease pain by increasing use of adaptive coping strategies such as distraction, relaxation, and changing activity patterns as pain is affected by thoughts, feelings, and behaviors).
Exercise-
Exercise is the most important intervention in the management of OA. Exercise builds muscle strength and endurance, improves joint flexibility and motion. Exercise is beneficial even to those patients who are at a healthy weight because increased muscle strength can reduce some of the complications of OA. With the doctor’s advice low impact activities that will not increase the chance of exacerbating symptoms of OA should be encouraged.

Simple activities like walking around the neighborhood or taking a fun, easy exercise class can reduce pain and help maintain (or attain) a healthy weight.
Strengthening exercises build muscles around OA-affected joints.
Stretching: slow, gentle stretching of joints may improve flexibility, decreases stiffness and reduces pain. Exercises such as yoga and tai chi can be practiced to manage stiffness.
Range-of-motion exercise helps maintain and improve joint flexibility and reduce stiffness.
Aerobic exercise helps to improve stamina and energy levels and also help to reduce excess weight.

Weight loss-
Overweight and obese patients with osteoarthritis experience more pain and disability than patients who are not overweight. Excess weight adds additional stress to weight-bearing joints, such as the hips, knees, feet and back. Lifestyle behavioural weight management (BWM) interventions such as eating fewer calories and increasing physical activity should be encouraged to lose weight.
Physical aids-
Other Non-pharmacological therapy includes a referral to a physical therapist; knee braces, orthotics, and appropriate footwear can reduce pain and improve function in people with poor alignment.
Heat and cold-
Heat or cold (or combination of the two) can be used in OA. Heat can be applied with warm towels, hot packs, or warm bath (it increases blood flow and reduces pain and stiffness). In some cases cold packs can relieve pain or numb the sore area by reducing inflammation.
Massage-
Massage with lightly stroke and /or knead the painful muscles may be a pain relief approach.
Apart from the traditional non-pharmacological approaches pulsed ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, electro-acupuncture, and low level laser therapy are newer therapies.
Pharmacological therapy-
The primary strategy for pharmacological management of OA is to control pain and improve function and quality of life for the patient, while limiting drug toxicity as there is no cure for OA.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen): Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a commonly prescribed oral analgesic to treat mild to moderate OA pain.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs can be used for relieving pain in OA (However, treatment with NSAIDs is associated with gastrointestinal effects and potential toxicity, especially in the elderly persons). New classes of NSAIDS called Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX’2) inhibitors are also in use (one of the class, refecoxib was found to increase the risk of cardiovascular events and was withdrawn in 2004, celecoxib and eterocoxib are in use). Topical NSAIDs, in the form of cream, patches, gels, solutions, have been found to be effective in reducing pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions, including OA. The benefit of topical NSAIDs is that they eliminate the gastrointestinal side effects of oral treatment. However, they have been associated with certain local adverse effects and they may be less effective than oral NSAIDs.
Opioids may be used for pain relief in patients who cannot use either NSAIDs or acetaminophen; however drug abuse is high with opioids.
Intra-articular corticosteroids: Treatment with corticosteroids injected directly into the joint (intra-articular) has been shown to be effective, especially in OA of the knee.
Viscosupplementation: This involves a series of injections of either hyaluronan or hylan products (hyaluronan is a polysaccharide and is one of the main components of the extracellular matrix).
Surgical Management-
Joint replacement surgery: Patients who experience severe pain and show extensive narrowing of joint space and medicines are not effective; these patients are eligible for joint replacement surgery. Joint replacement surgery is removing a damaged joint and putting in an artificial one (A joint is where two or more bones come together, like the knee, hip, and shoulder).
Osteotomy: Osteotomy is the cutting and reshaping of bones with the purpose of altering the area of the joint which bears weight.
Arthroscopic debridement and lavage are two processes that involve removing damaged cartilage, bone, and excess debris surrounding the joint."
Orbital Varix,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/orbital-varix,"Orbital varix is a tumour (vascular hamartoma) which comprises of collection of venous channels. Primary varix may be a congenital lesion or it may be acquired following trauma. Orbital varix may be distensible or non-distensible. It presents with intermittent proptosis which increases with straining, crying or stooping.
Any recent thrombosis or haemorrhage is associated with rapid development of proptosis, pain and limitation of ocular movement. On the other hand, atrophy of orbital fat may produce enophthalmos in some cases. Pulsations may be present with an associated arteriovenous malformation or with transmitted intracranial pulsations due to a mass adjacent to a bony defect.
Orbital varix is usually diagnosed between the ages of 10 to 30 years. However, it may be seen in any age group, including neonates. Varix usually affects superior ophthalmic vein. Other veins of the orbit may also be involved.","Wright (1974) has classified initial symptoms of orbital varices into five groups as

Variable proptosis, associated with dilated veins in the eyelids and episcleral tissue.
Dilated veins in the eyelid and anterior orbit.
Variable proptosis without any visible lesions.
Acute orbital haemorrhage.
Acute thrombophlebitis.

In addition, venous varices may be associated with

Recurrent orbital pain.
Diminution of vision due to involvement of optic nerve.
Ocular movement disorders.","Venous varices are rare orbital lesions which causes characteristic intermittent proptosis.
Llyod (1971) divided orbital varices into two types

Varices not associated with an arterio-venous malformation within orbit or cranium. These represent primary congenital venous malformations which are not secondary to arterialisation of venous system.
Varices produced secondary to an intra-orbital or intra-cranial arterio-venous communication. These angiomas are usually found in the middle cranial fossa with venous communication through superior orbital fissure.

Although varix is most probably congenital in origin, the clinical signs may not become apparent until later in life, most cases presenting themselves during first three decades of life.","Clinical features
Orbital varix is usually unilateral, vascular malformation (commonly venous in origin).
There is non-pulsatile, intermittent axial proptosis which is not associated with bruit. There may be associated prominent conjunctival vessels. Proptosis may be accentuated or precipitated by dependent head posture or by Valsalva manoeuvre.
It may be associated with vascular lesions of eyelids or conjunctiva, and may be of arterial or venous origin.
There may be enophthalmos due to fat atrophy.
It may show occasional bruising. There may be extensive involvement of peri-orbital or intra-cranial regions.
Histopathology
Varix is seen as one or more dilated veins, frequently with thrombosis and hyalinisation. Thrombosed varix may lead to pathologic reaction showing intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia.

Investigations

X-ray: X-ray may give evidence of calcification due to phlebolith.
CT Imaging: An orbital varix has globular or smooth fusiform appearance, which enhances strongly with contrast medium. It increases in size on Valsalva manoeuvre on dynamic CT scanning.
MRI Imaging: MRI signal depends upon presence of flow within varix. Patent lumen appears as an area of flow void on both T1 and T2-weighted scans. Contrast enhancement is variable and may be absent. Slow flow or thrombus in varix will give it a slight heterogeneous appearance.
A and B-scan ultrasonography: There is increased size of the lesion on ultrasonography.
Venography: This may demonstrate abnormal saccular vessels flowing out through venous channels.
Colour Doppler Imaging: This may be used to demonstrate an orbital varix. This is a non-invasive method of investigation.


Differential diagnosis
Orbital varix should be distinguished from other vascular lesions of the orbit such as

Haemangioma.
Lymphangioma.
Idiopathic orbital inflammation.
Carotid-cavernous fistula.
Dural shunt.","Management of orbital varix is difficult.
Most orbital varices are left as such and are observed over time.
Surgical therapy
Surgical excision is rather difficult. Intraoperative venography and glue embolisation may be helpful. This may be followed by excision.

Prognosis
Prognosis is good in most patients with primary orbital varix. Recurrence after subtotal excision is an issue of concern. Most patients remain stable without evidence of re-bleeding."
Orbital Fat Prolapse,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/orbital-fat-prolapse,"Orbital fat prolapse is produced due to extrusion of intraconal (inside the extra-ocular muscle cone) orbital fat beneath the conjunctiva.
Steatoblepharon is due to prolapse of orbital fat into the eyelids. It is a common finding and is generally related to the ageing process. The fat pockets present around the muscle cone in the orbits bulge forward behind the lax orbital septum.
Orbital fat Prolapse is different from steatoblepharon and presents as a subconjunctival mass rather than a swelling of the eyelid. It may be unilateral or bilateral and is related to

Eyelid surgery.
Trauma.
Generalised elastosis (cutis laxa).
Idiopathic (most common).

Orbital fat prolapse may protrude through dehiscence in Tenon’s capsule or may extend into the hood of Tenon’s capsule. It extends along extra-ocular muscle to its insertion on the sclera. Mostly it is due to ageing as is seen in older adults, but it may be seen in children as well.","Patient usually presents for cosmetic reason.
Symptoms may include
Swelling beneath bulbar conjunctiva.
Very large lesions lifting the upper eyelid may cause dryness of eyes or formation of Dellen.
Patient usually does not have symptoms like pain or inflammation.","Mostly orbital fat prolapse is due to ageing as is seen in older adults, but it may be seen in children as well.
It may be unilateral or bilateral and is related to

Eyelid surgery.
Trauma.
Cutis laxa (Generalised elastosis).
Idiopathic (most common).

Hypertrophic type of Blepharochalasis may also be associated with orbital fat prolapse.
Orbital fat prolapse may protrude through dehiscence in Tenon’s capsule or may extend into the hood of Tenon’s capsule. It extends along extra-ocular muscle to its insertion on the sclera.","Diagnosis is clinical.
Orbital fat prolapse is seen most commonly supero-temporally where it protrudes beneath the palpebral lobe of lacrimal gland. It is seen as soft yellowish-white fat lobule beneath the bulbar conjunctiva, adjacent to lateral rectus muscle, or sometimes over it.
Small lesions may not normally be visible and are seen only when the upper eyelid is pulled upwards. Thus, patient may not even be aware of its presence.
Larger lesions may be visible within palpebral fissure.
Very large lesions may lead to corneal dryness or may lead to Dellen formation.
This condition may be unilateral or bilateral.","Lesions usually do not require any treatment.
Treatment is indicated for cosmetic reasons or when lesion is producing symptoms such as corneal exposure and dryness.
Treatment is surgical by which protruding portion of orbital fat prolapse is removed through conjunctival incision."
Orbital Cavernous Haemangioma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/orbital-cavernous-haemangioma,"Cavernous Haemangioma is the most common primary orbital tumour in adults. This lesion consists of angiographically silent venous malformation. The classification of Cavernous haemangioma is a misnomer. It is usually centered on intraconal compartment of orbit and may contain phleboliths visible on imaging. Cavernous haemangioma consists of venous malformation having vascular spaces lined with endothelium and a fibrous pseudo-capsule. Rarely, cavernous haemangioma may be intra-osseous, and thus lies in extraconal compartment.
Cavernous haemangioma may occur in different parts of the eye and adnexa viz. orbit, eyelid, retina and uveal tract. Haemangioma produces proptosis of the eyeball. Sometimes, it causes marked proptosis which may be accentuated due to vascular engorgement. It usually does not decrease in size with passage of time. It rarely, if ever, causes visual impairment and generally, binocularity is not affected in axial proptosis.","Symptoms may include

Painless slowly progressive proptosis
Diplopia
Orbital mass may be present (extraconal lesions)
Diminution of vision (Rare)
Amaurosis (Rare).","Cavernous haemangioma is a benign tumour that is usually seen in adults as relatively stationary or slowly progressive mass. It is a hamartoma composed of dilated large vascular spaces.
The classification as a tumour is a misnomer, since this represents an angiographically silent venous malformation consisting of vascular spaces lined with endothelium.","Clinically, Cavernous haemangioma present as a relatively stationary or slowly progressive benign tumour that may produce painless proptosis. Increased growth may be seen following trauma or in pregnancy. Since it occurs in muscle cone, it produces axial proptosis. It is generally not associated with inflammatory signs. Visual function is usually not affected. Since the proptosis is in straight ahead position, binocular vision may not be compromised. With marked proptosis, the constituent vessels may get engorged as in the act of crying.
Haemangioma is cosmetically unsightly and does not decrease in size with passage of time. Rarely, it may be bilateral. Although, generally being solitary tumour, there may sometimes be multiple masses, as is seen in blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (characterised by numerous malformations of the venous system significantly involving skin and visceral organs). Rarely, multiple confluent cavernous haemangioma may lead to simultaneous involvement of orbit and brain. There may be phleboliths seen on imaging.
Rarely, Cavernous haemangioma present as intra-osseous lesion affecting the orbital bones. Intra-osseous lesion, since being extraconal, presents with non-axial proptosis.

Histopathology
Cavernous haemangioma represents an angiographically silent venous malformation consisting of vascular spaces lined with endothelium and bound by a pseudo-capsule. These are separated by connective tissue that contains smooth muscle. It may contain phleboliths.
Frank haemorrhage is atypical, but hemosiderin staining may occur.
Investigations

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Cavernous haemangioma mostly shows low T1 signal and high T2 signal with variable enhancement. Dynamic post gadolinium MRI shows progressive spread of enhancement from a single point or small component of the mass. This is a characteristic feature of Cavernous haemangioma. This helps in monitoring of tumours where conservative approach is considered instead of surgical therapy.
Computerised axial tomography (CAT): It may show well circumscribed intraconal lesion with mild to moderate enhancement. There may be areas of thrombosis.
Ultrasonography: Ultrasonography shows well defined, round intraconal lesion with high internal reflectivity.


Differential Diagnosis

Lymphangioma
Neurofibroma
Schwannoma
Fibrous histiocytoma
Melanoma
Solitary fibrous tumour
Haemangiopericytoma","Conservative therapy
Small, asymptomatic orbital Cavernous haemangioma may be observed periodically for any growth and increase in size.
Surgical therapy
Surgical therapy may be required for larger and symptomatic tumours. Complete and meticulous excision is necessary to avoid recurrence.

Conjunctival or cutaneous approach: Conjunctival or cutaneous approach may be used for removal of anterior lesions.
Lateral orbitotomy: Lateral orbitotomy may be required to remove deep tumours. Sometimes, it is done along with osteotomy.
Trans-cranial approach: Trans-cranial approach may be used for lesions localised at the orbital apex.


Prognosis
The management of orbital Cavernous haemangioma is not satisfactory. The proptosis is relieved only to a limited extent by irradiation. Surgical removal of this vascular tumour by orbitotomy may not be fully successful because of the extent of lesion. Surgical procedures or even ligation of feeding vessel to tumour, do carry the risk of damage to orbital structures e.g. damage to extra-ocular muscles resulting in ophthalmoplegia."
Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/orbital-solitary-fibrous-tumour,"Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour (SFT) is an uncommon benign spindle cell tumour with characteristics of mesenchymal fibroblast- like cells. It was originally recognised in the pleura. It is also seen in peritoneum, mediastinum, deep soft tissues of extremities, and conjunctiva as well.
Orbital solitary fibrous tumour in orbit may involve intraconal or extraconal compartment, lacrimal sac, lacrimal gland fossa, and eyelids. Orbital SFT was misdiagnosed until its characteristic features, particularly strong and diffuse immune-reactivity to CD 34 (cluster of differentiation 34 is a marker for primitive blood and bone marrow derived progenitor cells) was described. It is possible that orbital SFTs were under diagnosed earlier because of its rarity in extra-pleural sites and histological similarity to other spindle-cell tumours.
WHO in 2002 considered that SFTs, haemangiopericytomas, and giant-cell angiofibromas, represent a spectrum of spindle-cell neoplasm, rather than distinct pathologic entities.","SFT most commonly presents in middle-aged patients with symptoms such as

Gradual unilateral progressive proptosis.
Mass effect as non pulsatile tumour (predominantly in the superior part of orbit).
Diminution of vision.
Restriction of ocular movements.
Blepharoptosis.

It is usually not associated with features of pain or entrapment of nerves.
Recurrent tumours often invade surrounding soft tissue or bone, with possibility of spread into nasal sinuses or cranial cavities.","Orbital solitary fibrous tumour is an uncommon benign spindle cell tumour with ultra structural and immuno-histochemical characteristics of mesenchymal fibroblast like cells.
SFTs are presumed to arise from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells that have the capacity to differentiate along endothelial, pericytic, or fibroblastic phenotypes, similar to normal angiogenesis. This may explain the presence of the characteristic haemangiopericytoma like vessels. Currently, there is no stain to identify specific lineage such as pericytic origin.","Orbital solitary fibrous tumour is unilateral and occurs in both adults and children. Patient generally presents with proptosis and displacement of eyeball due to mass effect. It usually show slow clinical course without vision loss or significant pain. It may occur supero-temporally and may simulate lacrimal gland tumour. It may simultaneously involve orbit and nasal cavity. Occasionally, SFT may be aggressive and can extend to the central nervous system. Malignant transformation and metastasis are rare.

Histopathology:
Histopathologically, morphology of SFTs varies from highly cellular vascular lesion to fibrous areas with less number of cells. Fibrous matrix contains broad bands of collagen. Characteristic haemangiopericytoma like vascular branching, which is characterised by bifurcating dilated blood vessels with perivascular fibrosis, may be present. There is poor correlation between morphology and malignant potential.
In most SFTs, immuno-histochemistry shows an intense reactivity for vimentin (protein seen in cells derived from mesenchyme), CD34 and CD99.

Imaging studies:

CT Orbit: CT orbit shows mild to moderately enhanced well circumscribed mass with or without remodelling of adjacent bone.
MRI: MRI shows intermediate intensity mass on T1-weighted images with moderate enhancement after gadolium. The mass may be hyper or hypo-intense on T2-weighted images. Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) shows hyper-vascular arterial phase blush. MRI is also used for post-operative follow-up of SFT.
Ultrasonography: On ultrasonography, tumours show low reflectivity with moderate attenuation.


Differential diagnosis
SFT needs to be differentiated from

Orbital haemangiopericytoma
Fibrous histiocytoma
Neurofibroma
Optic nerve sheath meningioma
Schwannoma
Orbital metastasis.","Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Incomplete removal increases the risk of clinical recurrence of tumour. Therefore, close follow up is required in cases with suspected residual tumour. Adjunctive radiation therapy is used in highly cellular lesions.
Recurrent tumours may show features of malignancy and may metastasise."
Orbital Haemangiopericytoma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/orbital-haemangiopericytoma,"Orbital haemangiopericytoma is a rare soft-tissue neoplasm. This tumour originates from pericytes found around capillaries. Pericyte is a spindle shaped cell with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and an indistinct border. Routine histopathologic differentiation of pericyte from fibroblast, histiocyte and endothelial cell is difficult. Cellular differentiation may be best achieved by electron microscopy and immune-histochemistry.The function of pericytes is uncertain but is believed to provide mechanical support to the capillaries. Pericytes morphologically resemble smooth muscle. Besides the muscle cone of the eye, this tumour may also affect optic nerve meninges and lacrimal sac. This rare tumour is commonly encountered in lower extremities and retro-peritoneum.
Median age of occurrence is fourth decade, but haemangiopericytoma has been noted from 20 months to 87 years of age. The occurrence of tumour in orbit is more common in males.
Orbital haemangiopericytoma has similar signs and symptoms, and imaging study findings as orbital cavernous haemangioma. The tumour generally present with proptosis, diminution of vision, diplopia, and swelling. However, haemangiopericytoma may be more aggressive, extend throughout in orbit, and may even invade the cranial cavity. About one-third of Orbital haemangiopericytoma have histopathologic criteria compatible with malignancy. Distant metastasis of the tumour is uncommon.","Symptoms may include

Proptosis (commonly it is painless)
Mass effect in the form of swelling predominantly in the superior part of orbit
Diminution of vision
Diplopia
Disturbances in ocular motility

Frequent intracranial extension and involvement of nasal sinuses may produce additional symptoms.","There is controversy about the existence of haemangiopericytoma. Its derivation from pericytes is questioned and cases have been reclassified as solitary fibrous tumours, based on histopathologic and immune-histochemical findings. Traditionally, it has been categorised as vascular tumour.
Orbital haemangiopericytoma is believed to originate from extra-vascular pericytes, morphologically resembling smooth muscles around capillaries or from primitive mesenchymal cells. The function of pericyte is uncertain, but is believed to provide mechanical support to the capillaries, and may be having contractile function.","Orbital haemangiopericytoma occurs mainly in adults and has similar symptoms, signs, and imaging studies as cavernous haemangioma. Haemangiopericytoma may be more aggressive with time, extend throughout the orbit, and even invade the cranial cavity.
The main clinical features are proptosis and mass effect due to swelling, predominantly in the superior part of orbit, usually not associated with pain, features of infiltration, or entrapment. Patients usually have symptoms for less than one year on presentation, but there may be variation from one month to twenty six years.

Investigations:

Ultrasound: Ultrasound shows an encapsulated and well defined solid mass with low internal reflectivity. Orbital haemangiopericytoma may undergo cystic changes within necrotic zones and may resemble the echo-graphic appearance of lymphangioma.
Angiography: Angiography shows dilated feeding arteries, early tumour blush, and a rapid venous out flow. Haemangiopericytoma show rapid circulation with significant shunting of blood.
CT and MR imaging: On CT and MR imaging, Tumour present as well defined mass with homogeneous enhancement.


Histopathology:
Tumour shows uniformly cellular pattern with a sinusoidal vascular component often forming branching (stag horn) channels. Reticulin forms a dense mesh around individual cells. Pericytes show staining for vimentin (protein seen in mesenchymally derived cells) only.
In addition, haemangiopericytoma show myxoid, cellular and cystic component. Giant cells may be seen as well as areas of haemorrhage, necrosis and hyalinisation.
Three patterns have been described:

Solid
Sinusoidal
Mixed

Histopathologically, haemangiopericytoma is divided into three types:

Benign tumour
Intermediate (Borderline) tumour
Malignant tumour

Benign tumour shows minimal atypical cells with few mitotic figures. Intermediate and malignant tumour shows increasing mitosis, pleomorphism, necrosis, haemorrhage, compression of vascular spaces, and infiltrative margins. These tumours also show higher rate of metastasis as compared to benign one. However, distant metastasis is uncommon.

Differential diagnosis:

Infantile capillary haemangioma
Solitary fibrous tumour
Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma: Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma show areas of chondroid or cartilaginous tissue.
Fibrous histiocytoma: Fibrous histiocytoma show highly cellular pattern without a significant vascular component.
Cavernous haemangioma
Lymphangioma
Meningioma
Schwannoma

Optic nerve meningioma and dural sarcoid also needs to be differentiated, in cases where haemangiopericytoma arises from dural sheath.","Management of the tumours is mainly surgical.
Surgical therapy

Local Excision: Since these tumours usually have a pseudo-capsule, complete local excision is recommended, but it is also difficult because of friability.
Exenteration: Tumours with aggressive local behaviour may require exenteration (complete surgical removal of the eyeball and all contents of the eye socket).

Local recurrence may occur with incomplete or piecemeal excision. Recurrence is higher in malignant and borderline types. Even histologically diagnosed tumours may also recur or show distant metastasis. Since local recurrence and metastatic disease is a significant risk in these tumours, long term follow up (at least ten years) is necessary to ensure complete cure.
Orbital recurrence may require wider orbital exenteration, irradiation, or chemotherapy.
Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is not much of benefit and it may precipitate sarcomatous changes as well.

Prognosis
Since even more histologically benign lesions may result in clinically invasive disease or malignant transformation, the aggressiveness of a particular lesion is difficult to predict. Therefore, this tumour warrants aggressive surgery and often adjuvant therapy."
Orbital Lymphangioma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/orbital-lymphangioma,"Orbital Lymphangioma is an intra-orbital, non-encapsulated, congenital vascular tumour with a propensity for recurrent haemorrhage. Lymphangioma is a benign vascular hamartoma commonly noticed in head and neck area. Vascular mesenchyme that has differentiated abnormaly into isolated lymphatic- like spaces with no connection to the systemic circulation,may be the cause. Lymphangioma is a common vascular tumour in children and commonly presents in age group less than ten years. However, it is, sometimes detected later in life following trauma and intralesional haemorrhage. There are two growth patterns of lymphangioma (slow or rapidly explosive). Slow enlargement takes place over decades, producing progressive proptosis. In contrast, explosive growth results from intralesional haemorrhage arising from intrinsic nutrient vessels, or in association with an upper respiratory tract infection with proliferation of lymphoid tissue. In contrast to capillary haemangioma, lymphangiomas do not regress spontaneously. These tumours may become encapsulated due to normal bodily reaction to prevent expansion.
Lymphangiomas do not show any connection to the venous system, as has been studied by arteriography or venography. This is in contrast to orbital varix, which usually show connections to the venous system.
Like haemangiomas, Lymphangiomas may present in both superficial and deep orbital spaces. It consists of dilated, thin walled vascular chambers lined with endothelium. Fibrous stroma supports these and contain proteinaceous material reminiscent of lymph. There are micro-cystic, macro-cystic, or mixed types of Lymphangiomas.","Patient may present with symptoms such as

Proptosis, which may be slowly progressive or sudden and painful
Cutaneous blood filled cysts in superficial lesions
Conjunctival haemorrhage or chemosis, in superficially located tumours
Ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid)
Strabismus, mainly if tumour is large and infiltrative
Optic neuropathy
Vascular lesions in oral mucosa, in deeply situated lesions with frequent intracranial component.","Lymphangioma is likely to be derived from vascular mesenchyme that has differentiated abnormaly into isolated lymphatic- like spaces with no connection to the systemic circulation. They are benign hamartomatous vascular tumours, which differ from haemangiomas in that they do not display proliferating endothelial cells.
Lymphangiomas are usually located in the head and neck region and may involve eyelid, conjunctiva, and orbit.
Some reports suggest a slight female preponderance.","Clinically, the tumours may be located superficially in the orbit and are cystic. More commonly, these are infiltrative and diffuse in the orbit. Lymphangioma, located apically or with intracranial extension, is more likely to be associated with sub-mucosal oral lesions and intracranial vascular anomalies.
Histopathology:
Lymphangioma is a histologically benign but clinically aggressive tumour. Histopathologically, there are non-encapsulated, thin walled, endothelium lined channels and cystic vascular spaces which may contain fluid resembling lymph. Scattered lymphoid tissue aggregates or haemorrhage may be present.
Imaging studies:

Ultrasonography: Ultrasonography lacks specificity and soft tissue details. It identifies soft tissue and cystic components of the lesion.
Computed tomography: Computed tomography best delineates bony deformity produced by long-standing lesions. This technique delineates well soft tissue details in the lesion. However, like ultrasonography, it also lacks specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging provides superior quality soft tissue details. Identification of cystic structures and blood serum interfaces are diagnostic of the lesion. This technique helps in surgical planning of a case.

Differential diagnosis:
Differential diagnosis of lymphangioma includes

Orbital Varix
Orbital cellulitis
Orbital haemorrhage
Rhabdomyosarcoma
Neuroblastoma","Management includes
Supportive therapy
Since management of lymphangioma is difficult, it is advisable to observe it initially. Await for spontaneous resolution of haemorrhagic cyst or lymphoid hyperplasia associated with upper respiratory tract infection. Lymphangioma leading to compressive optic neuropathy, should be treated.
Medical therapy
Oral corticosteroids may help in the acute phase to resolve the lymphoid infiltration.
Surgical therapy
Surgery is, generally avoided since manipulation of the tumour may promote further spontaneous haemorrhage. Moreover, complete surgical excision is difficult due to infiltrative nature of the tumour and risk of damage to surrounding structures. Recurrence rate is high.
Indications for surgery are

Compressive optic neuropathy
Diplopia
Disfigurement

Surgical procedures are

Cyst drainage: Cyst drainage may be accomplished under ultrasonography, computed tomography,or open orbitotomy.
De-bulking of tumour: De-bulking of tumour, often with multiple partial resections, may provide satisfactory results.
Carbon dioxide laser: Carbon dioxide laser may be a useful adjuvant for more solid vascularised variant.


Prognosis: 
The majority of patients present in the first decade of life. It shows either slow or explosive growth patterns. Slow growth occurs over decades. Explosive growth results from intralesional haemorrhage.
Lymphangioma may present in childhood, when it may adversely affect vision. In most cases, it cannot be safely removed and may result in lifelong series of haemorrhages that threaten vision, produce pain, and may result in disfigurement.
Sequlae includes

Spontaneous resolution of mass with resolution of proptosis, usually over a period of weeks to months
Persistence of proptosis
Cutaneous disfigurement
Compressive optic neuropathy
Strabismus"
Psoriasis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/psoriasis,"It is an immune-mediated condition that affects the skin. It causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. The condition is not infectious and most people are affected only in small patches on their body. Psoriasis occurs when the immune system mistakes a normal skin cell for a pathogen, and sends out faulty signals that cause overproduction of new skin cells.
Psoriasis is not contagious . It may be classified as:
Non pustular

Psoriasis vulgaris: It is the most common form of psoriasis. It affects 80% to 90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques.
Psoriatic erythroderma: It involves the widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It is generally accompanied by severe itching, swelling and pain. This form of psoriasis can be fatal, as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and for the skin to perform barrier functions

Pustular
Pustular psoriasis appears as raised bumps that are filled with noninfectious pus (pustules). Pustular psoriasis can be localized, commonly to the hands and feet (palmoplantar pustulosis), or generalised with widespread patches occurring randomly on any part of the body. Types include:

Generalized pustular psoriasis (pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch)
Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (persistent palmoplantar pustulosis, pustular psoriasis of the Barber type, pustular psoriasis of the extremities)
Annular pustular psoriasis
Acrodermatitis continua
Impetigo herpetiformis

Other Additional types of psoriasis include

Drug-induced psoriasis
Inverse psoriasis.
Napkin psoriasis
Seborrheic-like psoriasis

Guttate psoriasis: It is characterized by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, teardrop-shaped lesions.
Nail psoriasis: It produces a variety of changes in the appearance of finger and toe nails. These changes include discoloring under the nail plate, pitting of the nails, lines going across the nails, thickening of the skin under the nail, and the loosening (onycholysis) and crumbling of the nail.
Psoriatic arthritis: It involves joint and connective tissue inflammation. Psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint, but is most common in the joints of the fingers and toes.","Plaque psoriasis
Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, that are covered in silver scales.
Guttate psoriasis:
It causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp","Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, in which part of the body’s own immune system becomes overactive and attacks normal tissues in the body.",A diagnosis of psoriasis is usually based on the appearance of the skin there are no special blood tests or diagnostic procedures.,"Bland emollients andmoisturizers, mineral oil, and petroleum jelly may help soothe affected skin
Bed rest
Treatment of complications (for example antibiotics, diuretics (water tablets), nutritional support)
Low-dose methotrexate, ciclosporin or acitretin
Individual cases have been reported to have successful outcomes with biologic agents, including the TNF-alpha inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, and ustekinumab."
Post Menopausal Bleeding,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/reproductive-system/female-gynaecological-diseases-/post-menopausal-bleeding-spotting,"Postmenopausal bleeding is a condition in which vaginal bleeding occurs at least 12 months after woman periods have stopped. Once a woman is at her menopausal age (45-49 years normally) has lasted 12 months without a period, she is believed to be in menopause stage.
It is not normal to bleed after post menopause. Women with postmenopausal bleeding should always see a doctor, in order to rule out serious medical problems even if there is spotting.",No Symptoms.,"Several health conditions are associated with postmenopausal bleeding, these conditions include:

Inflammation and thinning of the vaginal lining or thinning of the womb lining (endometrial atrophy) caused by lower estrogen levels
Polyps: Cervical or womb polyps, which are usually non-cancerous, can form in the cervix (neck of the womb) or womb
Hormonal replacement therapy: A thickened womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia) caused by hormone replacement therapy
Abnormalities of the cervix or the womb
Endometrial thickening: In this condition, the lining of the uterus (endometrium) becomes thick, usually as a result of too much estrogen and too little progesterone, and bleeding may occur as a result.
Endometrial cancer (uterine cancer): Bleeding after menopause can be a sign of endometrial cancer.
Other causes includes: Infection of the uterus or cervix, Certain medications such as blood thinners, and other types of cancer can cause postmenopausal bleeding.","For diagnosing the exact cause. Doctor may ask for the medical history and may conduct a pap smear test.
Further test that may be advised are:

A vaginal ultrasound
An endometrial biopsy (sample of the womb lining)
Hysteroscopy","Treatment depends on the cause of the post menopausal bleeding:

If bleeding is due to polyps, surgery may be required to remove them.
Endometrial atrophy can be treated with medication such as oestrogen cream or pessaries , If post menopausal bleeding is due to endometrial hyperplasia, it might be treated with hormone treatment (progestin) or total hysterectomy (surgery to remove cervix, uterus and ovaries) .
If post menausal bleeding is due to hormonal replacement therapy, HRT may be decreased/stopped depending upon the condition."
Parkinson's Disease,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/parkinson-s-disease,"Parkinson’s disease is a common chronic degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It is a disabling disease of the ageing population and affects mobility and locomotion. It is classified as a movement disorder. The motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease results from progressive damage of dopamine-generating cells of “substantia nigra”, of the basal ganglia, a part of the brain situated below the cerebral cortex and is called the mid-brain.
Parkinsonian syndromes can be divided into two types according to their origin:

Primary or idiopathic, where the cause of cell death is not fully understood; and
Secondary or acquired, where the disease can be linked to various kindsof offending agents such as drugs, toxins, infection, tumor etc.

Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease can have a hereditary basis or it can be sporadic in nature. A related group of disorders “Atypical Parkinsonism” represents wider distribution of the process of degeneration involving other critical areas of the brain. One of the diseases in this group is known as multiple system atrophy.","The three most important symptoms are:

Rest tremors: Uncontrollable shaking of a limb or a part of the body is known as tremor. Tremors usually begins in the hand or arm. It is more likely to occur when the limb is at rest and can be more noticeable when the patient is stressed, anxious or tired.
Bradykinesia or slowness of movements: It is another characteristic feature of PD which is associated with difficulties along the course of the movement process, from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement. Common examples of bradykinesia are slow speed doing a task, difficulty in turning on bed, dressing etc.
Muscle stiffness or rigidity: Stiffness and resistance to limb movement is known as rigidity and is caused by increased muscle tone, an excessive and continuous contraction of muscles.

Related to these three major symptoms is gait and posture impairment, which includes freezing of gait, postural instability and falls. Other motor symptoms include:

Mask like face
Reduced eye blink
Soft voice
Dysphagia
Dyskinesia or involuntary muscle cramps.

In addition, patients with Parkinson’s disease have several distressing non-motor symptoms. These include:

Mood disorders: depression
Sleep disturbance
Cognitive impairment or dementia
Sensory symptoms such as loss of smell sensation, pain etc.
Fainting
Disturbance of bowel and bladder
Sexual dysfunction.","Parkinson's disease/ Parkinsonian syndrome is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger in the nervous system, and helps control and co-ordinate body movements. If these nerve cells become damaged or die, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means that the part of the brain controlling movement cannot work so well, which causes movements to become slow and abnormal. The loss of nerve cells is a slow process. The level of dopamine in the brain falls over time. Only when 80% of the nerve cells in the substantia nigra have been lost, will the symptoms of Parkinson's disease appear and gradually become more severe. Most people with Parkinson's disease have idiopathic disease (having no specific known cause). Possible factors associated with the Parkinson's disease are:

Familial occurrence in small number of patients
Environment factors have been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's including:
i. Pesticide exposure
ii. Head injuries
iii. living in the rural area or farming
iv. Air pollution related to road traffic",Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is essentially a clinical diagnosis from information derived from medical history and neurological examination. There is no imaging or laboratory test that can identify the disease. Brain scans are sometimes used to rule out disorders that could give rise to similar symptoms,"There is no curative treatment for Parkinson’s diseases and related syndromes as their basic cause is uncertain. Symptomatic improvement for motor symptoms includes levodopa (usually combined with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor or COMT inhibitor), dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors.
Two stages are usually distinguished:
In initial stage individual with PD develops some disability for which he needs pharmacological treatment. In the later stage the patient develops motor complications related to levodopa usage.
Treatment in the initial stage aims for an optimal control between symptoms and side-effectsresulting from improvement of dopaminergic function. The start of levodopa (or L-DOPA) treatment may be delayed by using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists, in the hope of delaying the onset of dyskinesias.
In the second stage the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed.
Surgery: When medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery and deep brain stimulation can be of use. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life."
Pericarditis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/cardio-vascular/heart/pericarditis,"Pericarditisis aninflammationof thepericardium(the fluid-filled sac surrounding the heart). A characteristic chest painis often present. It is a common heart disease.
There are three main types of pericarditis:

Acute pericarditis where the symptoms last less than three months (with treatment, symptoms normally resolve within a week)
Recurring pericarditis– where someone has repeated episodes of acute pericarditis
Chronic pericarditis– acomplication of pericarditis, where the symptoms last longer than three months","The most common symptom of acute pericarditis is sharp, stabbing chest pain which radiates to the bottom of scapula on the back, and is relieved by sitting up and bending forward and worsened by lying down (recumbent or supine position) or inspiration (taking a breath in).
Other symptoms include:

Ahigh temperature (fever)
Shortness of breath
Fatigue
Nausea
Dry cough
Swelling of the legs or abdomen","The cause of pericarditis is not clear, but is often associated with the infection such as:
Viral infections that cause a chest cold or pneumonia, such as the echovirus or coxsackie virus (which are common in children), as well as influenza
Infections with bacteria (much less common)
Some fungal infections (even more rare)
Other factors include:

Immunologic conditions including systemic lupus erythematosus (more common among women) or rheumatic fever
Trauma to the heart, e.g. puncture, resulting in infection or inflammation
Malignancy
Side effect of medications, e.g.warfarin, isoniazid, heparin and cyclosporine","Pericarditis is generally ruled out through symptoms and physical examination and recent history.
A diagnosis is usually confirmed by electrocardiogram (ECG). During an ECG, electrodes are placed on skin to measure the electrical activity of heart.
Further tests include are: 

A chest X-ray
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
A computer tomography (CT) scan
An echocardiogram – this test is similar to an ultrasound scan, as it uses sound waves to build up a detailed picture of your heart and pericardium","Most cases of pericarditis are successfully treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs work by reducing the inflammation of the pericardium. They also help in relieving the chest pain.
Severe cases may require:

Pericardiocentesis: to treat pericardial effusion/tamponade
Steroids are used in acute pericarditis but are not favored because they increase the chance of recurrent pericarditis.
In cases of constrictive pericarditis, pericardiectomy may be done."
Pneumonia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/lungs/pneumonia,"Pneumonia is inflammation (swelling) of tissue in one or both lungs. It is a condition which primarily affects the air sacs of lungs called as alveoli. It is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly other microorganisms, certain drugs. As per UNICEF study in 2010, there were about 3.97 lakhs under 5 children died of pneumonia in India.","Common symptoms include:

Difficulty in breathing such that breathing may be rapid and shallow
Rapid heartbeat
Fever
Sweating and shivering
Loss of appetite
Pain in chest Less common symptoms of pneumonia can include:
Blood during cough (haemoptysis)
Headache
Fatigue
Nausea
Vomiting
Wheezing","Pneumonia is primarily due to infections caused by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites.
Bacterial pnuemonia:
Bacteria are the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in nearly 50% of cases . Other commonly isolated bacteria include haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae .
Viral pnuemonia:
Various virus include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus and para influenza .
Fungal pnuemonia: It is most often caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces,Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and Coccidioides immitis.","Early diagnosis and treatment is very important for invasive pneumococcal disease.
If disease, like meningitis or bloodstream infections, is suspected, samples of blood or cerebrospinal fluid are collected and sent to the laboratory for testing. It is important to know the cause and the severity of illness as the treatment will change depending on the cause. In the case of pneumococcal disease, antibiotics can help prevent severe illness.
If pneumococcus bacteria are present with invasive disease, they can be grown (cultured).
Physical examination may sometimes reveal low blood pressure, high heart rate or low oxygen saturation. The respiratory rate may be faster than normal and this may occur a day or two before other signs.","Rest Simple painkillers (analgesics) like ibuprufen
Antibiotics Fluids suffice for complete management. Antibiotics improve outcomes in those with bacterial pneumonia."
Poliomyelitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/poliomyelitis,"The words polio (grey) and myelon (marrow, indicating the spinal cord) are derived from the Greek. It is the effect of poliomyelitis virus on the spinal cord that leads to the classic manifestation of paralysis. Poliomyelitis or poliio is a crippling and potentially deadly infectious disease caused by poliovirus that spreads from person to person invading the brain and spinal cord resulting into paralysis. Humans are the only known reservoir of poliovirus, which is transmitted most frequently by persons having infection.
Due to unavailability of any cure till date vaccination is the best way of protection and the only way to control the spread of disease.
Generally ,two basic patterns of polio infection are :

Minor illness which does not involve the central nervous system (CNS), sometimes called abortive poliomyelitis,
A major illness involving the CNS, which may be paralytic or nonparalytic

Poliomyelitis generally spreads via the fecal-oral route by ingesting contaminated food or water and the oral-oral route. In endemic areas, polioviruses can affect the entire human population. The disease has a seasonal transmission in temperate climates, with a peak occurrence during summer and autumn.","Up to 95% of all polio infections are asymptomatic. Infected persons without symptoms shed virus in the stool and are able to transmit virus to other.
Approximately 4%–8% of polio infections result into a minor illness without clinical or laboratory evidence of central nervous system invasion. This is known as abortive poliomyelitis, and is characterized by complete recovery in less than a week. Three symptoms observed with this form of poliovirus infection are upper respiratory tract infection (sore throat and fever) ,gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea) and influenza-like illness.
1-2% of polio infections leads to Nonparalytic aseptic meningitis (symptoms of stiffness of the neck, back, and/or legs), usually following several days after the above mentioned symptoms similar to that of minor illness. Increased or abnormal sensations can also occur. Typically these symptoms will last from 2 to 10days, followed by complete recovery.
Fewer than 1% of all polio infections result in flaccid paralysis which is a clinical manifestation characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone . Paralytic symptoms generally begin 1 to 10 days after minor illness symptoms and progress for 2 to 3 days. Generally, no further paralysis occurs after the temperature returns to normal. Some signs and symptoms can include a loss of superficial reflexes, initially increased deep tendon reflexes and severe muscle aches and spasms in the limbs or back. The illness progresses to flaccid paralysis with diminished deep tendon reflexes, reaches a plateau without change for days to weeks, and is usually asymmetrical. Strength then begins to return. Patients do not experience sensory losses or changes in cognition.
Many persons with paralytic poliomyelitis recover completely and in most cases muscle function returns to some degree. Weakness or paralysis still present 12 months after onset is usually permanent.","Poliomyelitis is caused by infection with a virus called as poliovirus. It colonizes in the gastrointestinal tract specifically the pharynx and intestine. It is highly contagious and spreads through either fecal-oral route , ingestion of contaminated food and water or oral-oral route.","Viral Isolation

Poliovirus may be recovered from the stool or pharynx of a person with poliomyelitis. Isolation of virus from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is diagnostic, but is rarely accomplished. If poliovirus is isolated from a person with acute flaccid paralysis, it must be tested further, using oligonucleotide mapping (fingerprinting) or genomic sequencing, to determine if the virus is “wild type” (that is, the virus that causes polio disease) or vaccine type (virus that could derive from a vaccine strain).

Serology

Neutralizing antibodies appear early and may be at high levels by the time the patient is hospitalized; therefore, a four fold rise in antibody titer may not be demonstrated.

Cerebrospinal Fluid

In polio virus infection, the CSF usually contains an increased number of white blood cells (10–200 cells/mm3, primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein (40–50 mg/100 mL)","Because there is no cure for polio, supportive therapy is given to the patient. Supportive care usually consists of treating the symptoms until the patient recovers. It includes medication for polio symptoms, exercise and a balanced diet."
Post Polio Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/post-polio-syndrome,"Postpoliomyelitis syndrome (PPS) is characterized by the delayed appearance of new neuromuscular symptoms in patients many years after their acute poliomyelitis paralysis. PPS affects polio survivors years after they recover from their initial polio attack. It is usually 15 years or more but may range up to 30 to 40 years after an acute attack and is observed in approximately 25% to 28% of patients. PPS usually appears as a new weakening of the muscles affected in polio. This weakness progresses in a stepwise fashion, with periods of decline followed by periods of stability.","The main clinical features are new weakness, muscular fatigability, general fatigue, and pain. Cold intolerance, difficulty in swallowing and breathing, sleep disorders, and worsening functional abilities are also seen.","Only those who have been affected by polio can get PPS. Those who had more severe polio and who recovered more function are more likely to be strongly affected by PPS.
Although the cause of PPS is debated, the common theory is that it is the result of the slow weakening of nerve cells in the spinal cord that were damaged by the polio virus. Overworking these weakened neurons over time leads to even more damage, eventually giving rise to PPS. Symptoms of PPS can appear anywhere from 10 to 40 years after initial polio attack. The average time of onset is about 30 years after initial polio attack.
PPS is not an infectious disease- it cannot spread from one person to another. People affected by PPS are not experiencing another attack of the virus which causes polio, and they cannot spread polio to others.","PPS is difficult to diagnose since the symptoms of presentation are usually non-specific. Predominantly, it is diagnosed by exclusion. Your doctor will confirm your diagnosis by ruling out other illnesses and checking to see if you have:

Prior polio infection
A period of recovery after the first polio attack, followed by a period of long term stability
Slowly increasing and constant new muscle weakness
Less endurance with or without fatigue
Muscle atrophy (shrinkage), or muscle and joint pain.
Symptoms that persist for at least a year.

Do not diagnose yourself; you may have other issues that are causing your symptoms.","Although there is no specific treatment for PPS, an interdisciplinary management program can be useful in controlling symptoms. The effectiveness of pharmacological treatment and rehabilitation management in PPS is not yet established. Results indicate that IVIG, lamotrigine, muscle strengthening exercises and static magnetic ﬁelds may be beneﬁcial but need further investigation. The focus should be on a multidisciplinary approach with provision of appropriate exercise regimens and suitable medical or orthotic support."
papilloedema,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/papilloedema,"Papilloedema is defined as swelling of the optic nerve head (optic nerve takes visual sensations to the brain) secondary to raised intracranial pressure. It is nearly always bilateral but may have asymmetrical presentation.
All other causes showing disc swelling but not associated with raised intracranial pressure are labelled as disc oedema. All patients with disc oedema should be investigated to rule out intracranial mass.
All patients with raised intracranial pressure do not develop papilloedema. Patients who had papilloedema before may not develop it again due to scarring of optic nerve head on subsequent rise in intracranial pressure. Conversely, patients of benign intracranial hypertension will not show papilloedema.
Vision is usually well preserved in cases of papilloedema. In contrast, optic disc swelling due to optic nerve diseases is associated with defect in vision.
Papilloedema is due to axoplasmic flow stasis which results in disc oedema. Subarachnoid space of brain containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is continuous with that of optic nerve sheath. Therefore, rise in CSF pressure impedes axoplasmic transport which leads to papilloedema.

http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1217204-overview
Kanski, Jack J. Clinical Ophthalmology, A Systematic Approach.Third Edition.UK. Butterworth Heinemann, 1994.","Papilloedema may be asymptomatic and is found on routine examination of the eyes.
Most symptoms in papilloedema are due to rise in intracranial pressure. The main systemic features of raised intracranial pressure are:
- Headache which is characteristically most severe on awakening in the morning. It may be generalised or localised and may intensify with coughing, head movement , bending or with Valsalva manoeuvre ( forced expiration against closed mouth and nostrils). Pattern of headache may change in patients with previous chronic headache. Rarely, headache may be absent in patients with raised intracranial pressure.
- Nausea and projectile vomiting may be precipitated by fluctuations in intracranial pressure.
- Pulsatile tinnitus is ringing in the ear associated with pulse.
- Horizontal diplopia may be a false localising sign due to stretching of sixth intracranial nerve caused by raised intracranial pressure.
Visual symptoms are usually absent but patient may have blurring of vision, constriction of visual fields and decreased colour perception. Visual acuity may be well preserved except in advanced cases.","Raised intracranial pressure may be caused by:
- Space occupying lesions or any tumours.
- Increased CSF production.
- Obstruction in drainage of CSF.
- Decreased CSF resorption. For example, in venous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, cerebral trauma and subarachnoid haemorrhage.
- Cerebral oedema.
- Encephalitis.
- Benign/ Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumour cerebri).
- Use of certain medicines like tetracyclines, nalidixic acid and steroids.
- Craniosynostosis (closure of skull sutures leading to decreased intracranial space).
-    Severe or malignant systemic hypertension.","A patient should be evaluated for neurologic diseases, febrile illness and malignant hypertension. Record visual acuity, check for colour vision and pupillary reactions to exclude causes of disc oedema. Examination of ocular movements is important to exclude false localising sign due to sixth nerve palsy.
Detailed ocular fundus (inner back surface of eye) examination is done to assess papilloedema.
Early papilloedema may be difficult to diagnose and is characterised by:
- No visual symptoms and normal visual acuity.
- Disc hyperaemia.
- Subtle oedema and blurring of peripapillary nerve fiber layer.
- Small haemorrhages of the nerve fiber layer.
- Loss of spontaneous venous pulsations which are normally present in 80 percent of the individuals. If normal venous pulsations are present, diagnosis of papilloedema is unlikely.

Established papilloedema may have following features:
- Transient obscuration of vision lasting for few seconds. Visual acuity is normal or slightly reduced.
- Indistinct disc margin and elevation of disc surface.
- Partial obscuration of small blood vessels on disc.
- Venous engorgement.
- Peripapillary flame shaped haemorrhages and cotton wool spots.
- Circumferential retinal folds on temporal side of optic disc.
- Hard exudates forming incomplete star with missing temporal part.
- Field charting shows enlargement of blind spot.

Long lasting papilloedema may show:
- Variable visual acuity with constricted visual fields.
- Absence of exudates and haemorrhages.
- Small white opacities on the disc (corpora amylacea).

Atrophic papilloedema shows following features:
- Marked impairment of visual acuity.
- Optic discs are white with indistinct margin (secondary optic atrophy).

Papilloedema should be differentiated from conditions like
- Optic neuritis.
- Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy.
- Compressive optic neuropathy.
- Pseudopapilloedema (may be due to Hypermetropia, tilted disc, myelinated nerve fibers or optic disc drusen).
- Central retinal vein occlusion.
- Hypertension.

Investigations:
- Imaging studies of the brain like Computerised axial tomography(CAT) scan and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast.
- Magnetic resonance venography to exlude venous sinus thrombosis.
- B scan ultrasonography to exclude buried drusens.
- Fluorescein angiography may show dilatation of peripapillary capillaries with leakage of dye during late phase.
- Perimetry may show enlargement of blind spot and constriction of visual fields.
- Stereo colour photography helps in documentation of optic disc changes.
-     Lumbar puncture to measure opening pressure of CSF and to tap CSF for analysis.","It depends upon the underlying pathological process. It may include:
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and weight reduction may help in cases of benign intracranial hypertension.
- Corticosteroids may be helpful in inflammatory causes of raised intracranial pressure.
- Withdrawing medicines which causes raised intracranial pressure.
- Surgical removal of space occupying lesion.
- Lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunt to bypass CSF.
- Optic nerve sheath decompression to relieve ocular symptoms in cases of benign intracranial hypertension.

Visual prognosis is usually good if the raised intracranial pressure is well controlled. If papilloedema is not managed, it may lead to blindness.

Management is carried out under medical supervision."
Pterygium,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/pterygium,"A pterygium (plural is pterygia) is a wing like triangular sheet of fibro-vascular tissue which originates in peri-limbal conjunctiva within the palpebral fissure (opening of the eyes between the eyelids) with progressive involvement of the cornea. The lesion involves nasal side of limbus (junction between cornea and conjunctiva) more frequently as compared to temporal limbus. Rarely, it affects the temporal limbus alone.
Pterygium is usually bilateral, may be asymmetrical, among elderly patients.
Pterygium can vary from small, atrophic quiescent lesion to a large, aggressive, rapidly growing lesion that can distort corneal surface. In advanced cases, it can obscure optical center of the cornea and may affect vision.","Patients with pterygium may be asymptomatic or may present with following symptoms in eyes:
- Redness.
- Irritation.
- Itching.
- Pain.
- Watering.
- Swelling.
- Elevated lesion in eye.
- Blurring of vision due to induced astigmatism or obscuration of visual axis.
-    Restriction of movement with double vision.","Cause for pterygium is not known.
A genetic predisposition to development of pterygium may be apparent in certain families.
Risk factors for pterygium include:
- Increased exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, including living in subtropical and tropical climates near equator.
- Environmental micro-trauma.
- Engaging in occupations that require outdoor activities.
- Dry and hot climates.
- A higher incidence in males may reflect higher rate of exposure to ultraviolet radiation.

    Recurrent pterygium may be related to surgical trauma than ultraviolet radiation as avoidance of UV radiation has not affected the incidence of recurrence.","Diagnosis of pterygium is based on typical clinical appearance.
A pterygium causes fibro-vascular change on the surface of conjunctiva and cornea. It is more common for the pterygium to be present on the nasal conjunctiva and then to extend onto the surface of cornea, although it can present temporally, as well as in other locations.
Clinically, pterygium can present in different fashion:
Slow growing Pterygium:
Pterygium present as flat, slow growing lesion with minimal proliferation and a relatively atrophic appearance. Pterygium on surgical excision has a relatively lower incidence of recurrence.
Rapidly growing pterygium:
Pterygium present as significantly elevated fibro-vascular, rapidly growing lesion. It is progressive and fleshy with prominent vessels. Pterygium has a more aggressive clinical course and a higher incidence of recurrence following surgical excision.
Other types:
- Primary double pterygium: Primary double pterygium involves both nasal and temporal limbus.
- Recurrent pterygium: Recurrent pterygium shows more scarring and is sometimes much wider.
- Malignant pterygium: Malignant pterygium is a recurrent pterygium with symblepharon formation (adhesion of eyelid to the eyeball) and may be associated with restriction of ocular movement in opposite direction.

    Recurrence sometimes may be associated with pyogenic granuloma formation.
    Primary pterygium may undergo cystic changes with or without corneal dellen (thinning of cornea) and an eyelash may be present underneath the pterygium.
Clinical features:
Typical findings of pterygium include:
- Wing like triangular shaped fibro-vascular conjunctival growth within palpebral fissure with apex or head extending onto the cornea.
- Vascular straightening in the direction of advancing head of pterygium on the corneal surface.
- May be a thin translucent membrane or significantly thickened and elevated gelatinous tissue.
- It may be present on nasal and/or temporal limbus of one or both eyes.
- It may be white or pink lesion depending upon the vascularity.
- Advanced cases may show involvement of visual axis.
- A pigmented epithelial iron line called Stocker’s line may be present in long standing and non progressive pterygium.
- Pinguecula (yellowish triangular deposit on conjunctiva near limbus) may be present in ipsilateral or contra-lateral eye.
- Restriction of ocular movement with diplopia (often seen in recurrent pterygium with conjunctival loss and scarring).

Morphology of pterygium:
Various parts of pterygium are labelled as:-
- Head: Head is the part which rests on cornea.
- Neck: Neck is the constricted portion seen at the limbus.
- Body: Body is the remaining bulk of mass.
- Cap: Cap is a semi-lunar infiltrating portion in front of head of pterygium showing opaque spots (Fuch’s spots). It is suggestive of progression.

Imaging studies:
- Corneal topography: Corneal topography may be useful in assessing the degree of irregular astigmatism being produced by advanced pterygium.
- External photography: External surface photography may be done for pterygium to follow its progression over the time.
Histopathologic studies:
Pterygium is characterised by elastotic degeneration of collagen and fibro-vascular proliferation, with an overlying epithelial covering. Vermiform or elastotic degeneration refers to wavy worm-like appearance of the degenerated fibers. Epithelium is usually normal, but may be acanthotic, hyperkeratotic or even dysplastic and often exhibits goblet cell hyperplasia. Typically, there is destruction of Bowman’s layer and superficial stroma by fibro-vascular in-growth.
Pterygium shows an accumulation of degenerated sub-epithelial tissue which stains basophilic with a characteristic slate grey appearance on Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining. This tissue also stains with elastic tissue stains, but it is not true elastic tissue, in that it is not digested by elastase.
Pterygium should be distinguished from:
- Pseudo-pterygium: A pseudo-pterygium results from corneal inflammation due to chemical or thermal burns, trauma, marginal corneal disease, corneal ulcer or corneal perforation with reparative process leading to adhesion of a fold of conjunctiva to peripheral cornea.
Pseudo-pterygium is differentiated from true pterygium by history of inflammation in affected eye, location may be other than horizontal meridian, configuration not resembling wing structure, usually unilateral, non progressive and ability to pass probe (probe test) under the neck of pterygium.
- Neoplasia: Neoplasia such as carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma should be excluded.
- Pinguecula: Pinguecula is an actinic lesion confined to the peri-limbal conjunctiva that does not extend onto the cornea. Pinguecula are commonly occurring, usually small and asymptomatic, often yellow, raised nodules appearing on the bulbar conjunctiva. These are found commonly on the nasal side, but can also be present on temporal aspect of limbus. Pinguecula can occasionally undergo inflammation with symptoms of itching, burning or mild pain. Pinguecula show mild to moderate focal thickening of conjunctival stroma with elastotic degeneration of collagen.
- Pannus formation.
- Terrien’s marginal degeneration.
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
- Neurotrophic keratitis.
- Symblepharon.
- Limbal dermoid.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Management of pterygium involves medical and surgical therapy.
Corneal extension of pterygium should be measured and followed periodically every one to two years to determine the rate of growth toward the visual axis. Patient should be observed for symptoms of significant redness, discomfort or changes in visual function.
Medical therapy:
Medical therapy includes:
- Use of UV light blocking glasses: Patients who are at risk of developing pterygium because of a positive family history or because of extended period of exposure to UV light should use UV blocking glasses. Patient should avoid direct sunlight, wear goggles or may use cap to reduce ocular exposure.
- Use of tear substitutes: Use of tear substitutes may be considered to minimise effect of environmental micro-trauma in those who are exposed to it. Lubricating drops and ointments may be used to alleviate symptoms of inflamed pterygium.
- Vasoconstrictor drugs: Inflammation of pterygium may cause irritation, foreign body sensation and tearing and these symptoms may be relieved by use of vasoconstrictor eye drops.

Surgical therapy:
Pterygium can be removed for cosmetic reasons, as well as for any functional abnormality of vision or any symptoms of ocular discomfort.
Indications for surgical treatment of pterygium are:
- Encroachment upon pupillary area and blocking visual axis, thereby causing diminution of vision.
- Distortion of vision due to high astigmatism being induced by pterygium extending onto cornea.
- Recurrent inflammation.
- Evidence of progression like absence of Stocker’s line.
- Restriction of ocular movement with diplopia.
- Cosmetic removal.
- Rarely, for any suspected metaplastic change in pterygium.
Surgical modalities are:
- Pterygium excision with simple closure of wound.
- Bare sclera technique of excision.
- Transplantation of pterygium by suturing head of pterygium to its body or to the inferior fornix (junction between bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva).
- Conjunctival autograft (CAG) with or without the use of Mitomycin C (Mitomycin C prevents recurrence). Due to increased occurrence of scleral complications, beta irradiation and thiotepa to reduce recurrence of pterygium, are seldom used today.
- Amniotic membrane transplantation.
- Use of fibrin glue with conjunctival or amniotic membrane transplantation.
- Lamellar keratoplasty in conjunction with pterygium surgery.
- Early laser treatment of recurrences may help in preventing progression."
Pharyngoconjunctival Fever,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/pharyngoconjunctival-fever,"Pharyngoconjunctival Fever (PCF) is an acute and highly infectious adenoviral disease characterised by fever, pharyngitis, acute follicular conjunctivitis and regional lymphoid hyperplasia with tender, enlarged pre-auricular lymphadenopathy.
Adenoviruses are the commonest cause of acute viral infections of the conjunctiva, which may occur in epidemics or sporadically throughout the year.
Adenoviral ocular infections are:
- Pharyngoconjunctival fever.
- Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.
- Non-specific sporadic follicular conjunctivitis.
- Chronic papillary conjunctivitis.
Pharyngoconjunctival fever is seen predominantly in children and institutionalised people, with epidemics taking place within families, schools, prisons or military organisations.
PCF is mostly bilateral, with one eye typically having onset 1-3 days prior to the involvement of other eye. With bilateral disease, involvement of second eye is milder than the first eye.
Many cases of PCF are self-limiting and mild, although chronic infections have been reported. Long-term sequelae of eyes are rare.","Paryngoconjunctival fever is characterised by:
Systemic features may be:
- Sudden or gradual onset of fever in the range of 100-104°F, which lasts for about 10 days.
- Pharyngitis may be mild or quite painful.
- Malaise.
- Myalgia.
- Gastro-intestinal disturbances.
Ocular features may be:
- Conjunctival redness.
- Irritation of eyes.
- Burning sensation in eyes.
- Itching.
- Epiphora (watering from eyes).
- Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva).
- Subconjunctival (below conjunctiva) haemorrhage.
- Swelling of lids.
- Ecchymosis (non-raised reddish or bluish discolouration) of lids.
- Cervical lymphadenopathy.
- Painful pre-auricular lymphadenopathy.","Causative adenoviruses consist of a group of morphologically similar but antigenically distinct deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses which share a common complement-fixing antigen. Extremely stable adenovirus is present throughout the world and cause infections of the upper respiratory tract and eye.
Pharyngoconjunctival fever is caused most frequently by adenovirus serotypes 3 and 7, but serotypes 2, 4 and 14 have also been documented as aetiologic agents. Sporadic outbreaks may be caused by serotypes 1, 5, 6, 8, 11 and 19.
Transmission of adenovirus occurs through contact with:
- Infected upper respiratory droplets.
- Through fomites (inanimate objects).
- Through swimming pools.
The incubation period after exposure to adenovirus is 5-12 days (average is 8 days). Communicability of infection ranges from 100% during first few days to nil by 10-15 days after the onset of symptoms.","Diagnosis generally depends upon the history of presentation and physical features of the disease.
Patients may give history of recent exposure to a patient with red eye at home, workplace or school or they may give history of recent symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection.
On general examination, patient may have fever associated with pharyngitis and systemic features like myalgia, malaise or gastrointestinal disturbances. Pharyngitis shows a reddened posterior oro-pharynx covered with glassy follicles.
Non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy and tender pre-auricular lymphadenopathy may be present.
Ocular examination shows:
Slit-lamp examination by an eye specialist is required for diagnosis.
- Diffuse conjunctival hyperaemia, initially more pronounced in lower fornix (junction of eyelid and eyeball).
- Epiphora.
- Chemosis.
- Subconjunctival haemorrhage.
- Follicular conjunctival reaction.
- Papillary hypertrophy.
- Swelling of lids.
- Tenderness and ecchymosis of lower lid.
- Mild crusting of lids may be present.

Conjunctival membranes and pseudo-membranes may be present but are infrequent.

Keratitis and photophobia is less common.

Laboratory diagnosis:
Following tests may be used for diagnosis of PCF:
- Polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR assay):
- Fluorescent antibody test: 
- Immunoperoxidase test:
- Complement fixation test: Paired blood specimens are taken at one week and at 2-3 weeks interval after the onset of symptoms. A four-fold or greater increase in humoral antibody to adenovirus indicates a recent adenoviral infection.
- Giemsa cytology: Giemsa cytology is microscopic examination of stained conjunctival scrapings for intranuclear inclusions and lymphocytes.
- Cell culture: Virus may be cultured during acute epithelial stage only, since stromal infiltrates are thought to be immune complexes against residual viral antigen.
- Enzyme immune assays:
- AdenoPlus test: AdenoPlus test, an enhanced device for Rapid Pathogen Screening (RPS), is an antigen-based immunoassay. This test detects the presence of adenoviral particles and thus allows patient a speedier return to school or work when the virus is no longer detectable. Ability to confirm adenoviral infection may allow the study and use of novel therapies for the disease.

PCR test is more sensitive test, and therefore, use of AdenoPlus test should be limited to diagnostically challenging patients.


Pharyngoconjunctival fever may be differentiated from conditions like:
- Allergic conjunctivitis.
- Acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis.
- Bacterial conjunctivitis.
- Viral conjunctivitis.
- Chlamydial infections.
- Giant papillary conjunctivitis.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
PCF is usually a self-limiting disease and it tends to resolve spontaneously within 1-3 weeks without leaving any significant complications. There is no effective treatment for PCF.
Depending upon the severity of signs and symptoms, patients are followed up for several days to weeks.
Goals of pharmacotherapy (treatment with medicines) are to reduce morbidity and to prevent any complications.
Antiviral eye drops were tried in some patients, but there was no definite benefit of these.
Supportive medical management of PCF includes: 
- Cold compresses.
- Artificial tears: Artificial tears stabilise and thicken pre-corneal tear film and prolong tear film break-up time (BUT), which occurs with dry eye.
- Topical vasoconstrictor/antihistamine: Topical vasoconstrictor/antihistamine may be used for severe itching. On discontinuation, it may cause rebound (recurrence) of symptoms.
- Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) may be used to reduce inflammation.
- Topical antibiotic: Topical antibiotic may be used to prevent superadded bacterial infection.
- Cycloplegic agents: Cycloplegic agents may be used for severe photophobia.
- Mild topical corticosteroids: Mild topical corticosteroids may be used in severe membranous conjunctivitis or patients with marked reduction in vision due to late sub-epithelial opacities. While corticosteroids do assist in reducing inflammation, they do not have any significant impact on natural course of the disease. Taper this treatment slowly to avoid recurrence of corneal opacities. Any patient on topical corticosteroid should be observed for side effects such as elevated intraocular pressure and formation of cataract.
- Topical immune-suppressants (e.g.Tacrolimus ointment): Topical immune-suppressants can inhibit autoimmune inflammatory responses. Tacrolimus is a treatment option for sub-epithelial infiltrates in PCF. Tacrolimus suppresses cellular immunity.
- Ophthalmic antiseptics (e.g.Povidone-iodine): Ophthalmic antiseptics are broad-spectrum germicidal agents. Povidone-iodine has broad antibacterial and antiviral activity. Povidone iodine may be used to reduce the duration of disease.
Surgical management:
Surgery is extremely rare for PCF and is reserved for severe cases with cicatricial conjunctivitis or symblepharon.
If surgery is necessary, it is mainly in the form of:
- Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), along with low-dose mitomycin C (MMC), may be used to remove sub-epithelial opacities.
- Membrane or pseudomembrane removal: Membrane or pseudomembrane may be peeled off gently and a topical corticosteroid may be prescribed.
- Fornix reconstruction.
- Entropion repair.


Prognosis:
Most cases of PCF are acute, benign and self-limiting. Infection usually resolves spontaneously within 2-3 weeks.
Sub-epithelial infiltrates may last for months together and may decrease vision if visual axis is involved."
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/endocrinal/ovaries/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal disorders among women of reproductive age. PCOS is common diagnosis in women presenting with infertility. The exact prevalence of PCOS is not known as the syndrome is not defined precisely. Prevalence of PCOS is highly variable ranging from 2.2% to 26% globally. In few Asian countries prevalence figures are ranging from 2% to 7.5% in China and 6.3% in Srilanka. There are few studies conducted in India. Studies done in South India and Maharashtra, prevalence of PCOS (by Rotterdam's criteria) were reported as 9.13% and 22.5% (10.7% by Androgen Excess Society criteria) respectively.
PCOS was first reported by Stein and Leventhal in 1935, described as symptoms complex with amenorrhea, hirsutism, and enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts.
Polycystic ovary syndrome causes irregular menstrual cycles, excessive body or facial hair and polycystic ovaries as its main symptoms. Polycystic means ""many cysts,"" and PCOS often causes clusters of small, pearl-sized cysts in the ovaries. The cysts are fluid-filled and contain immature eggs. Women with PCOS produce slightly higher amounts of male hormones known as androgens, which contribute to some of the symptoms of the condition.
Early diagnosis of PCOS is important as it has been linked to an increased risk for developing several medical conditions including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease. PCOS is an emerging health problem during adolescence therefore promotion of healthy lifestyles and early interventions are required to prevent future morbidities.","PCOS is a syndrome disease defined by a group of signs (physical findings) and symptoms (patient complaints).Symptoms can vary from woman to woman. Some of the symptoms of PCOS include:

Infertility (not able to get pregnant) - PCOS is the most common cause of female infertility. Conception may take longer than in other women, or women with PCOS may have fewer children than they had planned. In addition, the rate of miscarriage is also higher in affected women.
Infrequent, absent, and/or irregular menstrual periods- The menstrual irregularities in PCOS usually present around the time of menarche.
Hirsutism -increased hair growth on the face, chest, back, thumbs, or toes
Acne, oily skin, or dandruff
Weight gain or obesity, usually with extra weight around the waist
Male-pattern baldness or thinning hair
Patches of skin on the neck, arms, breasts, or thighs that are thick and dark brown or black
Skin tags(excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck area)
Pelvic pain
Anxiety ordepression
Sleep apnea (when breathing stops for short periods of time while asleep)
Cysts in the ovaries","The cause of PCOS is unknown. But most experts think that several factors, including genetics, could play a role. Women with PCOS are more likely to have a mother or sister with PCOS.
A main underlying problem with PCOS is a hormonal imbalance. In women with PCOS, the ovaries make more androgens than normal. Androgens are male hormones that females also make. High levels of these hormones affect the development and release of eggs from ovary each month (process called ovulation).
Researchers also thinkinsulinmay be linked to PCOS. Insulin is ahormonethat controls the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy for the body to use or store. Many women with PCOS have too much insulin in their bodies because they have problems using it. Excess insulin appears to increase production of androgen.
High androgen levels can lead to:

Acne
Excessive hair growth
Weight gain
Problems with ovulation","There are different criteria for diagnosis of PCOS –

Rotterdam criteria (2004) include at least two of the following three conditions: Clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism (androgen excess), oligo-ovulation or anovulation (irregular ovulation or absence of ovulation), and polycystic ovaries (12 or more follicles in at least 1 ovary).

      (Exclusion of all other disorders that can result in menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, including adrenal or ovarian tumors, thyroid,dysfunction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, and Cushing syndrome)

Androgen Excess Society (AES), 2006 considered PCOS as a primarily disorder of androgen excess or hyperandrogenism and defined PCOS by the presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical), ovarian dysfunction and/or polycystic ovaries, and the exclusion of related disorders.

According to American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) 2015, diagnosis of PCOS is based on presence of at least two of the following three conditions: chronic anovulation (Cycle length &gt;35 days), hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological) and polycystic ovaries..

Tests for evaluation of PCOS:

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
Lutenizing hormone
Testosterone
Estrogens
Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)
Androstenedione
Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
Anti-Müllerian hormone

Tests to rule out other conditions withsimilar signs and symptoms:

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)– to rule out thyroid dysfunction.
Cortisol– to rule out Cushing syndrome.
Serum Prolactin– to rule out elevated prolactin (hyperprolactinemia)
17-hydroxyprogesterone– to rule out the most common form of congenital hyperplasia.
Serum free insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)– to rule out excess growth hormone (acromegaly).
Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEAS) – to rule out an adrenal tumor

Other blood tests to check a woman's health and detect any complications:

Lipid profile-to help determine risk of developing Cardiovascular disease; risk is associated with a lowHigh density lipoproteins (HDL), high low density lipoproteins (LDL), high total cholesteroland/or elevated triglycerides(Dyslipidemia).
Glucose orHemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)– can be used to detect diabetes; elevated in diabetes.
Insulin– often elevated in insulin resistance.

Imaging tests:
The following imaging studies may be used in the evaluation of PCOS:

Ovarian ultrasonography, preferably using transvaginal approach.
Pelvic CT scan or MRI to visualize the adrenals and ovaries.","Treatment of PCOS is not curative. Treatment focuses on controlling symptoms and managing the condition to prevent complications. The treatment will vary from woman to woman, depending on specific symptoms. Life style modifications consisting of a healthy diet and regular exercise are recommended for all women with PCOS, particularly those who are overweight.
Lifestyle modifications: Certain lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, are considered first-line treatment for adolescent girls and women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.These modifications have been effective in restoring ovulatory cycles and achieving pregnancy in obese women with PCOS. Weight loss in obese women with PCOS also improves androgen levels. Healthy eating tips include:

Limiting processed foods and foods with added sugars, eating a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fats,
Adding more whole-grain products, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats to diet.

This helps to lower blood glucose (sugar) levels, improve the body's use of insulin, and normalize hormone levels in the body. Even a 10 percent loss in body weight can restore a regular cycle.
Pharmacologic treatments: are used for metabolic derangements, such as anovulation, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities:

Oral contraceptive agents/ Birth control pills/ are used to regularize menstrual cyclefor women who don't want to get pregnant.

Fertility medication- Lack of ovulation is usually the reason for fertility problems in women with PCOS. Several medications that stimulate ovulation can help women with PCOS to become pregnant.

Clomiphene therapy to stimulate ovulation.
Metformin* along with clomiphene -The combination may help to use lower doses of medication to induce ovulation.

            (*Metformin (Glucophage) is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It has also been found to help with PCOS symptoms; Metformin controls blood glucose (sugar) and lowers testosterone production. It slows the growth of abnormal hair and, helps in ovulation.)

Gonadotropins-Low dose gonadotropin treatment regimens are used in PCOS cases, not responding to clomiphene therapy.

Medicine for increased hair growth or extra male hormones-Medicines called anti-androgens may reduce hair growth and clear acne. Anti-androgens are often combined with birth control pills. These medications should not be taken if one is trying for pregnancy.

​Surgical management of PCOS is advised in women who do not start ovulation after medical treatment. Various Laparoscopic ovarian surgeries include the following:

Electrocautery
Laser drilling
Multiple biopsy"
Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/perennial-allergic-conjunctivitis,"Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. Intermittent (less than 4 weeks in duration) seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and persistent (more than 4 weeks in duration) perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), makes up a large number of ocular (eye) allergy cases.
PAC may not be caused exclusively by seasonal allergens, although they may play a role. PAC generally occurs in response to environmental allergens (dust mites, animal dander, moulds, cockroach dust, airborne allergens and cigarette smoke) that are present throughout the year and is generally chronic. About 79% of patients of PAC may still have seasonal exacerbations and is generally worse in the autumn when exposure to house dust mites, animal dander and fungal allergens is greatest. It is less common and tends to be milder than the seasonal form. Most cases of SAC occur during the spring and autumn when the level of seasonal allergens (i.e. pollens) is high. Majority of PAC and SAC affect both young and middle-aged people of both sexes.
PAC and SAC are the common and sub-acute forms of ocular allergy, usually accompanied by seasonal allergic rhinitis. Although PAC and SAC are relatively mild conditions, rarely causing permanent visual impairment, their effects on the quality of life can be profound, with significant morbidity.
Atopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction) is a genetically determined predisposition to hypersensitivity reaction upon exposure to specific environmental allergens/antigens. It includes allergic conjunctivitis, as well as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma and eczema. Allergic conjunctivitis is a type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction, being mediated by de-granulation of mast cells (MCs) in response to the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE). 
Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). In perennial and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement never occurs. In contrast, AKC and VKC are severe inflammatory diseases, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment.
PAC and SAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis, while AKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively.","Symptoms of PAC and SAC are essentially similar and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen.
Ocular symptoms associated with PAC may be:
- Ocular itching.
- Redness of eyes.
- Watering or tearing (epiphora).
- Burning.
- Stinging or pricking sensation.
- Mucoid discharge.
- Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva).
- Photophobia (sensitivity to light).
- Eyelid swelling.
- Dryness of eyes.","Perennial allergic conjunctivitis is less common than SAC and tends to be milder than the seasonal form.
PAC causes symptoms throughout the year, generally worse in the autumn when exposure to animal dander, house dust mites and fungal allergens is highest. In contrast, Individuals with SAC have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time, caused by pollens from trees, weeds and grass, although the specific allergen varies in different geographic locations. Persons with SAC are symptom-free in winter/cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of these allergens.
Acute allergy is caused by IgE-mediated MC de-granulation, whereas chronic allergies are also associated with continuous activation of MC but with predominance of mediators, such as eosinophils and T- helper2 (Th2) lymphocyte-generated cytokines.
Pathophysiology:
Both PAC and SAC are type I (immediate) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, due to environmental airborne allergens, with the mast cell (MC) playing a central role. A reaction occurs when a sensitised individual is exposed to a particular antigen. IgE has strong affinity for MCs triggering its de-granulation.
An allergen reacts with specific IgE antibodies bound to a sensitised MC, triggering cross-linkage of the IgE molecules and an influx of calcium ions into the MC. This causes the MC to de-granulate and release preformed inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, which causes the signs and symptoms associated with the early-phase response in sensitised individuals.
There are two components of MC activation. The first is the release of pre-formed mediators, including histamine. The second is the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the subsequent metabolic cascade, resulting in production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
Histamine binds to Histamine1(H1) receptors and results in primary allergic symptoms of itching, burning, tearing and stinging sensation, while binding to the Histamine2(H2) receptor releases leukotrienes and prostaglandins, stimulating mucus production and also increasing vascular permeability. This early phase response is immediate and lasts clinically for about 20-30 minutes. (http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/histamine/jm/receptors.htm).
MC de-granulation also initiates a series of cellular and extracellular events, which lead to the late-phase response (production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes). MCs also release cytokines and chemotactic factors which induce the production of IgE from B lymphocytes (B cells), enhance the production of T helper lymphocytes, attract eosinophils and activate vascular endothelial corneal and conjunctival cells to release chemokines and adhesion molecules. Chemokines and adhesion molecules mediate the infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and T helper lymphocytes to the site of inflammation.
De-granulating eosinophils release toxic proteins which have cytotoxic effects and further enhance MC de-granulation. These products of eosinophils are toxic to the corneal epithelium and, if present chronically, may result in ulceration. The late phase response is characterised by an influx of multiple inflammatory cells.","Diagnosis of PAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist.
Important features of the history include a personal or family history of atopic disease such as:
- Allergic rhinitis.
- Bronchial asthma.
- Atopic dermatitis.
Patients with PAC are more likely to also have perennial rhinitis with features of sneezing and nasal discharge.

Signs and symptoms of PAC (are usually milder and with longer duration) and SAC are essentially similar and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen. The difference relies on specific allergens to which patients are sensitive and the chronicity of exposure.
PAC remains self-limited without ocular surface damage and is usually bilateral, although it may be asymmetrical. If the allergic insult occurs with a particular allergen entering only one eye, ocular changes may exceptionally be unilateral. The symptoms and signs are recurrent, occurring rapidly following the exposure to allergens.
PAC is less common than SAC and, as patients are chronically exposed to allergen, symptoms and signs occur year-round. The most common triggers are mould spores, animal dander, and dust mites usually found in the household. Patients may also be sensitive to seasonal allergen with a superimposed offender to their symptoms. Because of the prolonged exposure, the conjunctiva may become boggy, chronically red, and irritated. Papillary hypertrophy along the tarsal conjunctival surface may occur with chronic exposure to allergens in PAC. The discharge is whitish but thick, and even stringy.
Moulds, house dust, and animal dander participate in the disease process. The severity of symptoms varies depending on the type of allergen, its concentration, and time of exposure.
Dry eye facilitates allergen contact with the ocular surface since the capability of tears to ‘wash away’ the allergen is usually compromised.
The most significant symptom in allergic conjunctivitis is itching. Patients usually complain of intense itching of the eyes, sometimes along with a burning sensation and tearing. Discharge is usually serous, clear and watery, but with a ropy characteristic.
Without itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is suspect. With intense itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is very likely, but one should also consider ocular conditions like dry eye, toxic conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, blepharitis, and other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. In these other disorders, itching is usually mild and occasional.
Signs of SAC: 
Signs on slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) examination may be:
- Lid oedema.
- Mucoid discharge, which may be stringy/ropy.
- Mild papillary reaction.
- Conjunctival hyperaemia.
- Chemosis may be apparent in the bulbar and lower tarsal conjunctiva, giving to it a ‘milky’ or pale pink appearance.
- Dramatic unilateral bulging of the conjunctiva, frequently described as the acute formation of a ‘bubble’ in the eye, mainly when patients rub their eyes. Conjunctiva balloons, due to intense and acute infiltration of cells and fluids, causing chemosis.
- Dellen (shallow saucer-shaped excavations in periphery of cornea) of cornea may form due to intense conjunctival chemosis and unstable tear film. Dellen may resolve with the resolution of chemosis.
- Punctate keratitis may be present rarely.
Diagnostic procedures:
Investigations are generally not required.
- Intra-dermal skin test: Intra-dermal skin test is the standard clinical test for the diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Cutaneous tests, such as the scratch or prick, and more rarely, the intra-cutaneous injections, may be utilised to determine the antigens causing hypersensitivity. The prick test is the preferred method because it is more sensitive, less variable, and more comfortable to patients than the intra-cutaneous test.
Normally, skin test for particular allergens is rarely needed.
- Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. However, eosinophils are observed in the most severe cases, but are generally present in the deep layers of the substantia propria of the conjunctiva. For this reason, the absence of eosinophils on conjunctival scrapings does not rule out the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Even the presence of one eosinophil or eosinophilic granules is consistent with a diagnosis of allergy.
- Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Elevated IgE levels in serum (RAST, ELISA) and in tear fluid are present in almost all patients with PAC.
- Conjunctival provocation test: Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending allergen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of PAC. Conjunctival provocation tests are rarely necessary for the diagnosis of PAC and it has rather proven to be a reliable method to evaluate ocular therapeutics.
- Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as PAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features.
PAC should be differentiated from conditions like:
- Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome).
- Contact dermatitis.
- Toxic conjunctivitis.
- Blepharitis.
- Other forms of allergic conjunctivitis.
- Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.
- Bacterial conjunctivitis.
- Viral conjunctivitis.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
General measures:
Management of PAC includes reducing the amount of allergen exposure.
- Keeping household clean: Allergens in PAC are usually mould spores, animal dander, dust mites, and are predominantly found in the household. Therefore, carpets must be cleaned, changed or removed, as well as children’s stuffed animals, soft toys, and curtains. The mattress top and sides must also be cleaned and enclosed in plastic bags or other dust mite proof cover. Sheets, pillows and blankets should be washed in hot water (54 degree Celsius). Pillows and the base of the bed must be vacuumed regularly. Pets should be kept out of the bedroom, and the bathroom should be kept clean and dry to inhibit mould growth.
- Air purifiers: While it is better to stop dust mites at the source, reducing the dust levels in the air could be an adequate strategy. Air purifiers that use high-efficiency particulate arrestance or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration are more effective and safer (remove up to 99% of the material like dust mite faeces, all allergens, such as animal dander, dust, pollen, or cockroach faeces).
Supportive measures:
Supportive measures include:
- Cold compresses: Cold compresses decrease ocular inflammation.
- Saline solutions: Irrigation of ocular surface with saline solution facilitates removal of allergens, and thus achieves the primary principle of allergy management by minimising exposure of the ocular surface to allergens.
- Artificial tears: Preservative-free artificial tears may be used to wash or dilute allergens and inflammatory mediators away from the ocular surface. In addition, some types of artificial tears provide relief through the lubrication of the ocular surface. Ointments or time-released tear replacements, used at night, provide a longer-lasting measure, delivering ocular surface lubrication during sleep. These agents are used for mild PAC only since they neither treat the underlying allergic response nor modify the activity of any of the mediators of inflammation. Artificial tear solutions should be kept in refrigerator, since the use of cold drops produces vasoconstriction, ameliorating symptoms and signs.
- Avoidance of eye rubbing. 
Medical therapy:
It is important to note that in the treatment of acute or chronic forms of allergic eye diseases, patient compliance may not be ideal, giving the false impression of poor efficacy of medical therapy.
Medical therapy includes:
- Topical vasoconstrictors: Topical vasoconstrictors may provide short-term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. There is also some amelioration of ocular itching with the use of topical vasoconstrictors. Like artificial tears, topical vasoconstrictors do not reduce the allergic response, because they do not antagonise any of the mediators of allergic inflammation. However, prolonged use of vasoconstrictors may cause rebound conjunctival redness and inflammation (‘conjunctivitis medicamentosa’) (Spector S &amp; Raizman M (1994): Conjunctivitis medicamentosa. J Allergy Clin Immunol 94: 134–136.), and they are ineffective in severe ocular allergy. To minimise this potential side-effect, exposure to medicine should be limited through less frequent dosing or shorter treatment durations. Examples include naphazoline, and oxymetazoline.
- Topical antihistamine: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of PAC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. These medications do not affect other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which remain uninhibited. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.
- Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor), may provide short term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus.
- Systemic antihistamines: Systemic antihistamines may also relieve signs and symptoms of allergy. Oral antihistamines may be indicated for severe symptoms of allergy involving eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. Some, such as diphenhydramine, cause significant drowsiness and may be useful in aiding sleep.
- Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of PAC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.
- Topical mast cell stabilisers: Topical mast cell stabilisers decrease the de-granulation of conjunctival MCs, preventing the release of histamine and other chemotactic factors. However, the drug does not relieve existing symptoms and has no role in the treatment of the acute phase of PAC; mast cell stabilisers should be used on a prophylactic basis. They need to be used long term (treatment effect usually requires continued use over 5-7 days) or in conjunction with other classes of medications, such as antihistamines. Examples are cromolyn sodium, Iodoxamide, nedocromil, and pemirolast.
- H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (Dual-acting agents): Dual-acting agents exert multiple pharmacological effects, such as histamine receptor antagonist action, stabilisation of MC de-granulation and, subsequently, suppression of activation and infiltration of eosinophils. Examples are oloptadine, azelastine, epinastine and ketotifen. Drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines.
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit production of prostaglandins and have no role in blocking mediator such as leukotrienes. Example is ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac.
- Topical corticosteroids: Corticosteroid eye drops are very effective in treating PAC, but the numerous adverse effects, such as secondary infections, elevated intraocular pressure, and formation of cataract, make their use selective. Patients using corticosteroids should be closely monitored. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are broad and non-specific. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.
- Immune-modulators: Immune-modulators such as cyclosporine drops and tacrolimus ointment have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ocular allergy. Cyclosporine A is an immunosuppressant that acts by inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration by interfering with type IV allergic reactions in the conjunctiva. Tacrolimus acts mainly by inhibiting the action of T cells. Both agents are associated with fewer side effects and are preferred over chronic use of corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Immune-modulator agents are reserved for more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis (such as VKC and AKC) and have limited indications in cases of PAC.
- Allergen-specific immunotherapy: Allergen-specific immunotherapy is an effective treatment used to induce immunologic tolerance when the allergen is well known. The primary objectives of allergen-specific immunotherapy are to decrease the symptoms triggered by allergens and to prevent recurrence of the disease in the long term. It is indicated in patients who have evidence of specific IgE antibodies to clinically relevant allergens. Skin prick testing is the preferred method of testing for specific IgE antibodies and identification of allergen for the immunotherapy. Candidates for immunotherapy include those who:
(1) Have symptoms that are not well controlled by pharmacological therapy or avoidance measures.
(2) Require high doses of medication, multiple medications, or both to maintain control of their disease.
(3) Experience adverse effects of medications, or
(4) Wish to avoid the long-term use of pharmacological therapy.

Prognosis:
Prognosis of PAC is good despite significant discomfort and undesirable cosmetic appearance. Allergic conjunctivitis generally clears up readily. Although, allergic conjunctivitis may commonly reoccur, it rarely causes complications or visual loss."
Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/phlyctenular-keratoconjunctivitis,"Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis (PKC), Phlyctenular conjunctivitis, Phlyctenulosis or phlyctenular eye disease (PED) is an endogenous type IV delayed hypersensitivity (T cell-mediated) allergic reaction to an antigen. It is an inflammatory condition which causes marked photophobia and mucopurulent discharge. PKC is characterised by sub-epithelial, single or multiple, gray-white, raised conjunctival or corneal nodules, generally at or near the limbus, surrounded by a zone of engorged hyperaemic vessels.
The description of phlyctenulosis dates back to early Greek and Arabic writings. (Thygeson P. The etiology and treatment of phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis. Am J Ophthalmol. 1951; 34:1217-36). The term phlyctenule comes from the Greek word ‘phlyctena’ which means blister. Sorsby and Thygeson have implicated a higher incidence of PKC amongst children and young adult (Sorsby A. The etiology of phlyctenular ophthalmia. Br J Ophthalmol. 1942; 26: 159-79).
The most common cause of PKC is a hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculoprotein, particularly in the developing world, where Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) remains endemic. However, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), Chlamydia, parasitic infection, fungal infection, and more recently, HLA subtypes A26, B35, and DR8 have also been demonstrated as causative agents. Other risk factors include those common to communicable disease such as malnutrition, overcrowding, poor hygiene, and sanitation. There is slight overall predilection towards female gender, although this varies depending on the primary aetiology of PKC. PKC is not a blinding disease but it is a source of lowered visual acuity.","PKC produces symptoms like:

Conjunctival redness.
Itching.
Watering.
Discomfort.
Pain.
Irritation.
Bleb or nodule.
Photophobia.
Diminution of vision.","Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is an endogenous non-infectious inflammatory type IV delayed hypersensitivity (T cell-mediated) allergic reaction to an antigen. The disease is common in malnourished and debilitated children between five and twelve years of age. These children may suffer from enlarged tonsils, adenoids and cervical lymphadenopathy.
Various aetiological factors which contribute to development of PKC are:
Bacteria:

Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Staphylococcus aureus.
Propionibacterium acnes.
Chlamydia trachomatis.

Parasites:

Ascaris lumbricoides.
Ancylostoma dudenale.
Hymenolepis nana.
Entamoeba histolytica.

Fungi:

Candida albicans.
Coccidioides immitis.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes:

A26.
B35.
DR8.

Meibomitis:
Phlectenular keratitis may be associated with meibomitis ( Suzuki T, Mitsushi Y, Yoichiro S, et al. Phlectenular keratitis associated with meibomitis in young patients. Am J Ophthalmol. 2005; 140: 77-82).

Mycobacterium tuberculosis:
M. tuberculosis is the most common cause of PKC worldwide, more so in the developing world, where tuberculosis remains endemic. PKC can occur in:

Patients with active or inactive tuberculosis.
History of positive Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) test or X-ray chest.
Family history of tuberculosis.
Preclinical patients who will subsequently develop tuberculosis.

Tuberculosis related phlyctenulosis is more symptomatic and recurrent than phlyctenulosis caused by other pathogens. It frequently occurs as multiple lesions, and presents bilaterally in just over half of the cases, but may occur unilaterally as well. M. Tuberculosis is not being isolated from culture of ocular tissue. However, the diagnosis is made through systemic screening.
Staphylococcus aureus:
S. aureus is a more common cause of PKC in developed countries. Patients presenting with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) or chronic staphylococcal blepharoconjunctivitis are particularly susceptible. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation which may be substantiated with bacterial culture. It is less common and mild as compared to tuberculosis related PKC.
Propionibacterium acnes:
P.acnes is also linked to ocular surface inflammation (Suzuki T, Sano Y, Sasaki O, et al. Ocular surface inflammation induced by Propionibacterium acnes. Cornea.2002; 21: 812-7). Diagnosis depends upon the clinical presentation and bacterial culture.
Helminth infections:
Helminth is more common than other parasitic infections. Helminths primarily affect limbus and cornea and spare conjunctiva. Delayed hypersensitivity reaction is produced due to eosinophilic response. With antihelminthic therapy, resolution of disease is faster than other infectious causes.
Genetic association:
Suzuki et al envisaged a genetic association of PKC. These include Human leukocyte antigen subtype (HLA) A26, B35, DR8. It is proposed that Human leukocyte antigen subtype (HLA) A26, B35 and DR8 play a specific role in the corneal helper T lymphocyte type I reaction that may produce phlyctenule lesions.
Meibomitis:
Suzuki et al. showed a preponderance of phlyctenulosis related to meibomitis in female patients (Suzuki T, Mitsushi Y, Yoichiro S, et al. Phlectenular keratitis associated with meibomitis in young patients. Am J Ophthalmol. 2005; 140: 77-82).They suggested a link between the expressions of sex steroid hormone receptors on the ocular surface, which predisposes females to PKC secondary to meibomitis.","Clinical signs may vary slightly according to the specific causative organism. It may occur either unilaterally or bilaterally in the conjunctiva, cornea or at limbus. The presence of phlycten on the palpebral conjunctiva is a rarity. Phlyctenulosis may also be an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients with a recent history of bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infection.
Phlyctenulosis begins as phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis or phlyctenular conjunctivitis. Phlyctenulosis rarely starts as keratitis only. Phlyctenular conjunctivitis is more common on bulbar than over palpebral conjunctiva, in association with hyperaemia and little discharge. Symptoms are often mild and many patients may have asymptomatic phlyctenulosis. Disease limited to the conjunctiva is self-limiting and usually resolves within two weeks.
PKC presents as a small, round, elevated, grey or yellow, localised sub-epithelial infiltrate in the conjunctiva, limbus, or cornea, located adjacent to an area of hyperaemic blood vessels. Limbus is the most commonly affected site in PKC. In about two to three weeks time, these infiltrates ulcerate, leaving behind wedge-shaped fibro-vascular scars at limbus or in cornea. Phlyctenules of the conjunctiva do not form scars.
Diagnosis requires examination under slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye-specialist.
Clinical signs of PKC:

Blepharitis.
Meibomitis.
Inflammation of conjunctiva or cornea.
Conjunctival or scleral injection.
Sub-epithelial conjunctival or corneal nodules surrounded by engorged hyperaemic blood vessels.
Punctate epithelial keratopathy.
Pannus.
Necrosis and ulceration of infiltrates.
Wedge-shaped fibro-vascular scar.


Phlyctenulosis may show patterns such as:

‘Wandering phlyctenule’: ‘Wandering phlyctenule’ is the most characteristic presentation of PKC. Limbal phlyctenule spreads across the cornea paracentrally and perpendicular to the limbus, leaving behind a superficial and vascular scar in its place.
Marginal ulcers: Marginal ulcers may occur in which phlyctenulosis starts at the limbus and progresses to the cornea without leaving behind a clear space between the limbus and ulcer.
Diffuse central pattern: A diffuse central pattern without ulceration often occurs in recurrent disease. This may lead to an in-growth of superficial or deep vessels.
Pannus: There may be pannus formation in PKC. Pannus of PKC is distinguished from trachomatous pannus by the presence of diffuse central infiltrates and vessels which run straight from the limbus to the cornea.
Miliary disease: In miliary disease, small phlyctenules cover the surface of the cornea. It is rarely seen.


Histological studies:
Phlyctenules are sub-epithelial inflammatory infiltrates that contain cells such as histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. The basal epithelium overlying these nodular infiltrates is composed of mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils and Langerhans cells.
The inflammation in phlyctenular infiltrates is a delayed hypersensitivity response that predominantly has monocyte derived cells. Phlycten shows a characteristic sub-epithelial mononuclear infiltration in a triangular area, the apex being directed towards deeper layers of cornea. There is cuffing around stromal blood vessels with sub-epithelial mononuclear, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils. Perivascular infiltrate transforms into macrophages and finally into dendritic cells that react with monoclonal antibodies. Helper and inducer T-lymphocytes become sensitised, leading to the generation of activated T-cells and finally the release of lymphokines. Lymphokines cause an influx of inflammatory cells. Lymphocytes are less abundant than mononuclear cells in phlyctenular infiltrates.
When secondary infection supervenes, additional polymorphonuclear cells appear and the overlying epithelium undergoes necrosis.
Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis should be distinguished from conditions such as:

Trachoma.
Staphylococcal marginal keratitis.
Microbial keratitis.
Nodular episcleritis.
Inflamed pinguecula.
Inflammed pseudo-pterygium.
Foreign body granuloma.
Filtering bleb following glaucoma surgery.
Suture cyst.
Dermoid cyst.
Ocular rosacea.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision only.
The treatment of PKC is directed to improve general health of the child and management of local condition. Infected tonsils and adenoids should be properly treated. Attempts should be made to desensitise the patient against tubercular or staphylococcal allergens. Concurrent infections should be treated with systemic antibiotic therapy. Recurrences are frequent if general condition is not treated properly.
Management of phlyctenulosis consists of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory measures. Even asymptomatic patients should be treated because of high rate of recurrence.
General measures:

Eyelid hygiene: Any underlying blepharitis should be addressed to with proper hygiene. Eyelid margins should be properly cleaned with sterile cotton tipped applicator, soaked in baby ‘no tears’ shampoo.
Artificial tears: Artificial tears or lubricating ointments may be used for symptomatic relief.
Diet: A calorie-rich diet supplemented with vitamins A, C and D and calcium may be given.
Tinted glasses: Tinted glasses give protection against associated glare and photophobia.
Warm compresses and irrigation: Warm compresses and irrigation with saline reduces mucopurulent discharge in cases with superadded secondary infections.

Medical therapy: 
Topical antibiotic agents are indicated for use in conjunction with anti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids or cyclosporine regardless of aetiology.
Antibiotic therapy:
Antibiotics like oral tetracycline or erythromycin are effective in treating cases of S. aureus and P. acnes related disease. It has also been successfully used to treat patients with recurrent disease that has failed other therapeutic measures. Care should be taken when treating paediatric patients younger than eight years of age to avoid potential side-effects. Other antibiotics which may be used are gatifloxacin, bacitracin, and azithromycin.
Anti-tubercular therapy:
In tuberculosis associated PKC, patients should be screened for underlying active infection, and are treated with the appropriate anti-tubercular medical therapy. Family members or close contacts should also be screened and treated.
Anti-parasite medicines: 
Patients with helminthic infections should be treated with parasite-specific oral medication like mebendazole. PKC in these patients typically resolves quickly with therapy, with a low recurrence rate. Recurrence may be due to re-infection with the parasites.
Anti-fungal medicines: Anti-fungal medicines are used for a fungal infection and these diseases generally follow a successful course after treatment.
Topical corticosteroids:
Topical corticosteroids are used as anti-inflammatory therapy and is usually started early in the course of management. Corticosteroids should be tapered gradually since rapid tapers are associated with recurrence of the disease. Topical corticosteroids may be associated with ocular complications like raised intraocular pressure, cataract formation, and disturbance of accommodation.
Topical cyclosporine A:
Topical cyclosporine A, an immune-modulator, may be used to control signs of inflammation.
Cycloplegic agent may be required when cornea is involved.

Prognosis:
Phlyctenular conjunctivitis often has mild symptoms and many patients may be asymptomatic. Disease limited to the conjunctiva is self-limiting and usually resolves within two weeks without leaving any scar. However, recurrences are common.
Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis commonly affects limbus with nodular infiltrates. In about two to three weeks time, these infiltrates ulcerate, leaving behind wedge-shaped fibro-vascular scars at limbus or in cornea."
Plague,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/plague,"Plague is a communicable disease, caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is one of the oldest diseases known to man and still occurs in the tropics, subtropics and warmer areas of temperate countries. Past outbreaks have shown that plague may reoccur in areas that have long remained silent.
Plague is primarily a zoonotic disease (transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans)
of wild rodents and man is affected incidentally. It is transmitted from one rodent to another by fleas (ectoparasites) and from animals to humans either by the bite of infected fleas, or direct contact, inhalation and rarely, ingestion of infective materials when handling infected hosts.
Widespread pandemics (disease occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population) of plague have occurred in past with high mortality. It was known as the ""Black Death"" during the fourteenth century, causing an estimated 50 million deaths. Nearly half of deaths were in Asia and Africa and the other half were in Europe.
Plague is endemic (a disease that occurs regularly in a particular area) in many countries in Africa, former Soviet Union, Americas and Asia. The distribution of plague coincides with the geographical distribution of the rodents it infects, which are found in all continents except Australia.
Plague epidemics (unusually high occurrence of a disease in a population or area) have occurred in Africa, Asia, and South America but since the 1990s, most human cases have occurred in Africa. In 2013 there were 783 cases reported worldwide, including 126 deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 20 countries in Africa, America, and Asia are identified as natural foci for plague. The 3 most endemic countries are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru. In Madagascar, outbreaks have occurred nearly every year since 1980.
In India, outbreaks of plague occurred in Mamla village of district Beed, Maharashtra state (bubonic type) and district Surat in Gujarat state (pneumonic type) in September 1994. Subsequently, suspected cases of pneumonic plague were reported from Delhi, Varanasi, Karnataka and other states. A total of 876 cases and 54 deaths were reported. In 2002, outbreak of pneumonic plague occurred in Himachal Pradesh with 16 cases and 4 deaths. In 2004, outbreak of bubonic plague was reported from Dangud village, of district Uttar Kashi, Uttarakhand state with 8 cases &amp; 3 deaths. 
The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi has identified four sylvatic foci (affecting wild animals) in India; the tri-junction of south India (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu), Beed belt in Maharashtra, Rohru in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. NCDC is keeping routine surveillance in these areas.
Weak health systems and low standards of environmental hygiene are risk factors for outbreaks of human plague. As with many primarily zoonotic diseases, plague is a very severe disease in people, with case fatality rates of 50-60% if left untreated.","Incubation period (time taken between catching an infection and appearance of symptoms) of the disease is 3-7 days. Disease starts with flu like symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea.
Depending on the route of infection, there are three forms of plague: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.

Bubonicplague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea usually on the lower extremities. Plague bacillus(Y. pestis), enters at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it proliferates. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, swollen and is called a ""bubo"". The most usual place for this swelling is the groin, but it also occurs in the armpits and the neck. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores. Bubonic plague cannot spread from person to person.

Septicaemicplague occurs when infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without forming a “bubo"". Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Advanced stages of the bubonic form of plague will also lead to direct spread of Y. pestisin the blood.

Pneumonicplague-or lung-based plague- It is less common form of plague and is caused by spread of infection to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. It is highly infectious and can spread from human to human via infected air droplets or through infected clothing and other contaminated articles. Untreated pneumonic plague has a very high case-fatality ratio.","Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis (non-motile, non-acid fast, non spore forming, gram-negative cocco-bacillus). Y. pestis is easily destroyed by sunlight, high temperatures, and disinfectants. 
Vectors of plague- Fleas are the natural vectors of plague in the world. In India, the important fleas for plague transmission are Xenopsylla cheopis, X. astia and X. brasiliensis. Out of these X. cheopis is the principal vector.
Reservoir of infection – Wild rodents are the natural hosts of Y. pestis. At least 220 species of rodents which inhabit mountains, plains, deserts, cultivated fields and forests in both temperate and tropical climate are known to be infected with plague bacillus. Tatera indica among the wild rodents and Rattus norvegicus and R.rattus among the commensal rodents play an important role as reservoir of Y. pestis. In India Tatera indica acts as a main reservoir of infection, not the domestic rat (R.rattus).Generally the infection is maintained by the resistant species of the wild rodents. The susceptible rodents die due to the disease. 
Mode of transmission-
Flea bites-Plague bacteria are mostly transmitted by bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics (occurrence of disease at higher rates than expected, in animal population), many rodents die, and causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. Flea bite exposure may result in primarybubonic or septicaemic plague.
Contact with contaminated fluid or tissue- Humans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague-infected animal without using proper precautions such as hunters. This type of transmission results in bubonic plague or septicaemic plague.
Infectious droplets- Infected droplets from a case of pneumonic plaque can infect other person. Contact with infected cats can transmit the infection to humans by droplet infection.","When plague is suspected, clinical specimens should be collected immediately and specific antimicrobial treatment should be started before confirmation of laboratory diagnosis. Routine diagnostic specimens for smear and culture include the following: whole blood; aspirates from suspected buboes; pharyngeal swabs, sputum samples or tracheal washes (from those with suspected plague pharyngitis or pneumonia); and cerebrospinal fluid (from those with suspected meningitis).
Smear examination-During epidemics or epizootics, the examinations of smears (stained with Wayson's stain) that show the presence of characteristic bipolar stained plague bacilli are helpful in preliminary diagnosis.
Fluorescent antibody (FA) staining- the smears should be stained with the fluorescent-antibody test (FA).
Culture-Samples collected for culture can be transported to laboratory in Cary-Blair transport medium then cultured on other biological media. Presence of bacilli can be confirmed by Bacteriophage Lysis Test.
Serology- Presence of a single high titre of plague antibody in individual who has not been vaccinated earlier gives a presumptive diagnosis of plague. Whereas a fourfold rise in antibody in two serum samples collected at least 10 days apart gives the confirmation of plague diagnosis. 
Other tests- Polymerase Chain Reaction for the detection of selected Yesinia pestis genes, ELISA based rapid serological tests, animal inoculation.
Laboratory diagnostic categories for human plague are as follows:
Case definitions:
Suspect plague: 

Compatible clinical and epidemiological features; and
Suspicious organisms seen or isolated from clinical specimens.

Presumptive plague:

Y. pestis F1 antigen detected in clinical materials by direct fluorescent antibody testing, or by some other standardized antigen detection method; or
isolate from a clinical specimen demonstrates biochemical reactions consistent with Y. pestis or Polymerase chain reaction(PCR) positivity; or
a single serum specimen is found positive for diagnostic levels of antibodies to Y. pestis F1 antigen, not explainable on the basis of prior infection or immunization.

Confirmed plague: 

isolate identified as Y. pestis by phage lysis of cultures; or
a significant (a 4-fold or greater) change in antibody titre to the F1 antigen in paired serum specimens

Post-mortem specimens, specimens from rodent tissues, flea specimens, and soil specimens are also used to determine the eco-epidemiology of the infection.","As the disease is fatal early diagnosis and treatment is essential for the good prognosis of the patient.
When human plague is suspected on clinical and epidemiological grounds, appropriate specimens/samples for laboratory confirmation of disease should be obtained immediately.
The patient should be started on specific antimicrobial therapy without waiting for a definitive answer from the laboratory.
Suspect plague patients with evidence of pneumonia should be placed in isolation, and should be managed under respiratory droplet precautions."
Pinguecula,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/pinguecula,"Pinguecula (derived from Latin word pinguis, which means fat) represents an area of bulbar conjunctival thickening adjoining limbus in the palpebral fissure area. Pinguecula are less transparent than normal conjunctiva and often have a fatty appearance. They are usually bilateral, triangular, elevated, white to yellow in colour, horizontally oriented, and are located nasally much more often than temporally. They may also present on both the nasal and temporal conjunctiva in the eyes of some patients. Pinguecula does not cross the limbus, and current information suggests that pinguecula does not progress to pterygium and that the two are distinct disorders.
Pinguecula are associated with a two to three fold increase in incidence of age-related macular degeneration, possibly through a common light exposure effect (Pham TQ et al).
Degenerations of the conjunctiva are common conditions that, in most cases, have relatively little effect on ocular function and vision. These conditions increase in prevalence with increasing age as a result of past inflammation, of long-term toxic effects of environmental exposure, or of ageing itself. Conjunctival degenerations may be associated with chronic irritation, dryness, or previous history of trauma.","Pinguecula are usually asymptomatic.
Pinguecula are associated only rarely with any symptoms other than a minimal cosmetic effect.
Ocular (eye) symptoms include:

Foreign body sensation.
Watering.
Burning.
Itching.
Mild pain.
Redness.

Pinguecula remains relatively free from congestion and becomes conspicuous when the eye is inflamed. They may become red with surface keratinisation. When inflamed, the diagnosis of pingueculitis is given.","The causes of pinguecula are not known with certainty.
Pinguecula are more likely in males, welders and older individuals living in warmer climates. Pinguecula are more common than pterygium.
Evidence suggests its association with:

Increasing age: Pinguecula are seen in most of the patients by 70- 80 years of age.
Ultraviolet light exposure: Chronic sunlight exposure (actinic damage due to both ultraviolet A and B light) is associated with outdoor work and equatorial residence. Association with light exposure is found in welders, who have higher rate of pinguecula as compared to non-welders. Possibly, predominantly nasal location is related to reflection of light from the nose onto the nasal conjunctiva. The effect of ultraviolet light may be mediated by mutations in gene p53.
Gaucher’s disease (inherited lipid storage disease): Pigmented, brown, triangular pinguecula may appear during second decade of Gaucher’s disease. Biopsy from the lesions shows Gaucher cells. Patients with Gaucher’s disease may show associated congenital oculomotor apraxia and white retinal infiltrates. There may be corneal opacities in posterior two-thirds of the stroma. The genetic defect in Gaucher’s disease lies on chromosome 1q21.","The diagnosis is usually clinical and may require slit-lamp biomicroscopy.
Clinical features:

Pinguecula are located in the anterior bulbar conjunctiva adjacent to the limbus.
Pinguecula are located in the inter-palpebral zone, usually more nasally than temporally.
Usually, there is no corneal involvement. However, there may be punctate epithelial erosions or dellen (thinning of adjacent peripheral part of cornea due to drying).
A grading system showed no significant difference in nasal versus temporal size.
Pinguecula are yellowish-white sub-epithelial deposits with possible calcifications.
Occasionally pinguecula may become inflamed (called pingueculitis) and irritated due to surface drying. The lesion may become highly vascularised and injected.

Histopathology:
Pinguecula are characterised by elstotic degeneration of the collagen with hyalinisation of the conjunctival stroma, collection of basophilic elastotic fibers, and granular deposits.

The sub-epithelial tissue shows senile elastosis (basophilic degeneration) and irregular, dense sub-epithelial concretions. The elastotic material stains positively for elastin but is not sensitive to elastase (elastotic degeneration).
The elastotic material is positive for elastin, microfibrillar protein, and amyloid P. These components never normally co-localise.

The control of elastogenesis is seriously defective so that elastic fibers are abnormal in biochemical organisation. Normal assembly of elastic fibers is prevented due to marked reduction of elastic microfibrils. Limbal epithelial cell mutations at gene p53, probably due to ultraviolet irradiation, may be an early event in the development of pinguecula. The sub-epithelial dense concretions stain positively for lysozyme. Pinguecula may calcify with time.
Electron microscopy:
Under electron microscopy, the granular material consists of hollow- centered microfibrils, which are elastic fiber precursors. The material is overproduced by numerous fibroblasts that are thought to be actinically activated by sunlight exposure.
Immunoassay:
Immunoassay suggests an abnormal epidermal differentiation due to a decline in the expression of Pax6, K19 keratin, and MUC5AC (a protein coding gene), but an associated increase in K10 and K14 keratin. There is also active proliferation of the squamous cells, as evidenced by positive expression of Ki67, P63, and K16 keratin.
Pinguecula may become inflamed due to dryness and irritation, resulting in so-called pingueculitis. The most common causes of such inflammation are:

Mechanical irritation: Irritation by the edge of a contact lens is a frequent cause.
Ocular surface disease. 

The epithelium overlying a pinguecula can vary from atrophic and thinned to hyperplastic and thickened. Pinguecula are unlikely to undergo malignant conversion. However, a lesion that looks atypical should be approached with suspicion. Actinic keratosis, dysplastic changes, and even carcinoma can arise within the epithelium overlying a pinguecula.

Pinguecula may be differentiated from:

Limbal dermoid.
Conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia.
Conjunctival tumour like naevus, melanoma or papilloma.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Management includes:
Medical therapy:

Elimination of the causal factor.
Artificial tears: Increased lubrication with artificial tears.
Topical corticosteroids: Short course (to avoid adverse side-effects) of topical steroids may be given when inflammation is significant.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used in cases of associated inflammation.

Surgical therapy:

Simple excision: Chronically inflamed or cosmetically unsatisfactory pingueculae rarely warrant simple excision.
Laser photocoagulation: Laser photocoagulation may be used to remove pinguecula.

Steroids or surgical excision are discouraged unless there is chronic irritation or interference with the use of contact lens.

Prognosis:
Pinguecula may grow slowly over time but are associated with minimal ocular morbidity (a diseased state)."
Preterm birth,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/reproductive-system/female-gynaecological-diseases-/preterm-birth,"Preterm birth (premature birth) is a significant public health problem across the world because of associated neonatal (first 28 days of life) mortality and short- and long-term morbidity and disability in later life. Preterm is defined by World Health Organization (WHO) as babies born alive before 37 completed weeks of gestation or fewer than 259 days of gestation since the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period (LMP). Normally, a pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks.
According to WHO, every year about 15 million babies are born prematurely around the world and that is more than one in 10 of all babies born globally. Almost 1 million children die each year due to complications of preterm birth (2013). Across 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born. In India, out of 27 million babies born every year (2010 data), 3.5 million babies born are premature.
Newborn deaths (those in the first month of life) account for 40 percent of all deaths among children under five years of age. Preterm birth is the world’s number one cause of newborn deaths, and the second leading cause of all child deaths under five, after pneumonia.
Many of the preterm babies who survive suffer from various disabilities like cerebral palsy, sensory deficits, learning disabilities and respiratory illnesses. The morbidity associated with preterm birth often extends to later life, resulting in physical, psychological and economic stress to the individual and the family.
Though occurrence of preterm birth is a global problem, but more than 60% of preterm births occur in Africa and South Asia. In the lower-income countries, on average, 12% of babies are born too early compared with 9% in higher-income countries. Within countries, poorer families are at higher risk. Survival of premature babies also depends on where they are born; almost 9 out of every 10 preterm babies survive in high-income countries because of enhanced basic care and awareness, in sharp contrast to about 1 out of 10 in low-income countries.
More than three-quarters of preterm /premature babies can be saved with often inexpensive care such as essential care during child birth, antenatal steroid injections (given to pregnant women at risk of preterm labour under set criteria to strengthen the babies’ lungs) and postnatal care like kangaroo mother care (the baby is carried by the mother with skin-to-skin contact and frequent breastfeeding), and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.
Identificationof risk factors in women with improved care before, between and during pregnancies; better access to contraceptives and increased empowerment/ education can further decrease the preterm birth rate (the number of preterm births divided by the number of live births).","Preterm is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy or fewer than 259 days of gestation are completed since the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period (LMP). There are sub-categories of preterm birth, based on gestational age:

extremely preterm (&lt;28 weeks)
very preterm (28 to &lt;32 weeks)
moderate to late preterm (32 to &lt;37 weeks)

Various methods for detection of gestational age-

Early ultrasound scan: estimation of fetal crown-rump length, biparietal diameter / femur length between gestational ages 6 – 18 weeks.
Fundal Height: distance from pubis symphysis to fundus.
Last menstrual period: women’s recall of the date of the first day of her last menstrual period.
Newborn examination: validated scores using external +/or neurological examination.
Best obstetric estimate: uses an algorithm to estimate gestational age based on best information available, commonly used in high-income settings.

Signs of preterm labor-
In most cases, preterm labor begins unexpectedly and the cause is unknown. Like regular labor, signs of early labor are—

Change in vaginal discharge (a significant increase in the amount of discharge or leaking fluid or bleeding from the vagina).
Contractions (the abdomen tightens like a fist) every 10 minutes or more often.
Pelvic pressure—the feeling that the baby is pushing down.
Low, dull backache.
Cramps that feel like a menstrual period.
Abdominal cramps with or without diarrhea.","Preterm birth is a syndrome with a variety of causes which can be classified into two broad subtypes:
(1) Spontaneous preterm birth: may occur after spontaneous onset of labor or following prelabour premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).The cause of spontaneous preterm labor cannot be unidentified in up to half of all cases.
(2) Provider-initiated preterm birth is defined as induction of labor or elective caesarian birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation for maternal or fetal indications (both “urgent” and “discretionary”), or other non-medical reasons.
Most preterm births occurs spontaneously but some are due to early induction of labour or caesarean birth, whether for medical or non-medical reasons.
Approximately 45–50% of preterm births are idiopathic (unknown cause), 30% are related to preterm rupture of membranes (PROM) and another 15–20% are attributed to medically indicated or elective preterm deliveries.
Risk factors for preterm birth-

Age at pregnancy: adolescent pregnancy and advanced maternal age
Previous preterm birth
Multiple pregnancies (such as twins, triplets)
Infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure
Genetic influences
Nutritional: under nutrition, obesity, micronutrient deficiencies
Life style-Women who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or take other recreational drugs are at a higher risk of having preterm babies. Stress from any cause, excessive physical work or long times spent standing are also known to increase a woman’s risk of having preterm birth.

However, often no cause is identified.","To date, there is no single test or sequence of assessment measures to accurately predict preterm birth. Clinical, biophysical, and biochemical tests that can be used as predictors for preterm birth are:
Clinical predictors- Identification of clinical risk factors, symptoms like pelvic pressure, increased vaginal discharge/changed in vaginal discharge, backache, and menstrual-like cramps.
Biophysical predictors-

Uterine contraction monitoring during pregnancy- Uterine contractions can be detected through maternal self-perception, and by medical personnel and by electronic monitoring.
Cervical Examination-

Manual examinationfor cervical dilatation, effacement, consistency, position, and station of the presenting part can be determined by manual examination. Cervical dilatation and effacement have been related to an increased risk of preterm birth.
Sonographic evaluation:A decreased cervical length as measured by endovaginal ultrasound examination has also been related to an increased risk of preterm birth.


Fetal fibronectin; in the vaginal discharge may be measured. The presence of this protein is linked to preterm birth.
Tests for Preterm/ premature baby may include-

Cardio-respiratory monitoring: baby's breathing and heart rate are monitored on a continuous basis.
Fluid input and output is monitored in determining fluid requirements in very low birth weight babies.
Blood tests:to know about complete blood count, white blood cell (WBC) count, blood type and antibody testing (Coombs test), serum sodium, potassium, calcium, glucose and bilirubin levels in baby's blood.
Echocardiogram:This test is an ultrasound of the heart to check for problems with structure and function of baby's heart.
Ultrasound scan:Ultrasound scans may be done to check the brain for bleeding or fluid buildup or to examine the abdominal organs for problems in the gastrointestinal tract, liver or kidneys.
Eye examination:An ophthalmologist (eye doctor) may examine baby’s eyes and vision to check for problems with the retina (retinopathy of prematurity).

If baby develops any complications, other specialized testing may be needed.","Management of preterm birth incorporates the specialized care of women during pregnancy and child birth along with care of newborn (preterm) baby.
(a) Care during pregnancy and child birth-
Some women are at increased risk of preterm delivery which can be identified during their antenatal care visits, based on following factors-

Obstetric history (e.g., known uterine or cervical anomaly or previous preterm birth).
Presenting pregnancy characteristics (e.g., hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, diabetes, multiple gestation, bleeding).
Young adolescents.

Women who are identified at risk of preterm delivery or in preterm labour should give birth at a health facility (hospital) where more advanced, specialized care is available for mothers and their babies. The safest time for referral to such type of hospital is when the baby is still in the womb.
Once preterm labor has started, there are interventions that can prolong pregnancy and improve health outcomes and survival for the premature baby. Interventions to prolong pregnancy include the provision of tocolytic agents that inhibit uterine contractions to suppress labor (e.g., oxytocin antagonists, betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, magnesium sulphate).
The other three interventions that can be provided during the pregnancy period will help in improving health outcomes of the premature baby: antenatal corticosteroids, antibiotics for prelabour premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and magnesium sulphate.

Use of antenatal corticosteroids- Women in preterm labour, before 34 weeks of pregnancy have been completed, should receive steroid injections to speed up the development of the baby’s lungs. The administration of antenatal corticosteroids to pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth (as early as 23 weeks) can reduce the premature baby’s risk of death, respiratory distress and developmental problems.
Use of antibiotics for prelabour premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)- Premature rupture of the membranes is strongly associated with infection of the amniotic membranes contributing to preterm birth and other poor fetal outcomes such as cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease. Antibiotic treatment for PPROM may delay onset of labor for up to 48 hours and reduce neonatal infections.

(Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combination (such as co-amoxiclav) should be avoided in women at risk of preterm delivery because of the increased risk of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.*)

Use of magnesium sulphate- The administration of magnesium sulphate to women at risk of preterm birth before 32 weeks of gestation helps to protect the baby’s brain, reduce rates of cerebral palsy and improve long-term neonatal health outcomes.

(b)Special care for newborn (preterm) baby-
Preterm baby needs special care because -
Preterm babies are not fully developed to live in the world outside their mother’s womb. Therefore they need special care along with same care that other babies get to overcome the following challenges- 
Keeping warm:
Preterm babies lose body heat more easily, which may result in to hypothermia. Hence they need extra energy and care to stay warm and grow. Babies should be kept warm right after birth; they should be dried thoroughly and placed on their mother’s abdomen. After the umbilical cord has been clamped and cut and if they breathe normally they should be put on their mother’s chest, with skin-to-skin contact, until after the first breastfeed. They should not be bathed right away.
Breathing:
The lungs of preterm babies are not fully developed and lack surfactant (a substance that helps keep the lungs expanded). Many preterm babies start breathing on their own, when they are born, but others need to be resuscitated (newborn resuscitation or ventilation with a bag and mask). If breathing problems persist, they may need additional support from a machine (ventilator) and extra oxygen.Sometimes, some premature babies that have started breathing are not strong enough to continue on their own and exhaust themselves and may stop breathing (apnoea). Constant supervision is required for such babies.
Feeding:
Preterm babies may need additional support for feeding as the coordinated suck and swallow reflex is not yet fully developed. Breast milk is the best nutrition for preterm babies. Babies should be breastfed as soon as possible after birth. Most premature babies who are unable to coordinate the suck and swallow reflex can be fed their mother’s expressed breast milk by cup, spoon or nasogastric tube. Breast is best: just like full-term babies.
Infections:
The immune systems of preterm babies are not fully developed therefore they are more susceptible to infections. If they get an infection, they have a higher risk of dying.
Preterm babies should be protected from infections by:

Gloves and cutting devices used for clamping and cutting the umbilical cord should be sterile,
Everyone who touches the mother or the baby should have clean hands.
Medical examinations and procedures should only be done if necessary.
Babies who have infections need treatment with antibiotics. 

Brain:
Preterm babies are at risk of bleeding in the brain, during birth and in the first few days after birth. Lack of oxygen can also cause brain injuries. Bleeding or lack of oxygen to the brain can result in cerebral palsy, developmental delays and learning difficulties
Eyes:
Preterm babies’ eyes can be damaged by abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. The condition is usually more severe in very premature babies and if they are given too-high a level of oxygen. This can result in visual impairment or blindness.
Care for preterm babies with complications:
Babies who have additional complications may need to be kept in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Hospitals with NICU can provide specialized care for newborn babies with serious health problems. They have special equipments and specially trained doctors and nurses who provide around-the-clock care for preterm babies, who need extra support to keep warm, to breathe and to be fed, or who are very sick.
As preterm babies (and full-term babies with low birth weight) need extra warmth and support for feeding, Kangaroo Mother Care is a good technique for these babies, if they do not have other serious problems (breathing well with normal heart rate).
Kangaroo Mother Care: is a technique by which the baby is held on an adult’s chest—usually the mother—with skin-to-skin contact, for extended periods of time. The baby is placed on his/her mother’s chest and stays there, day and night, held in place by a cloth that is wrapped and tied at the mother’s back. It is an effective way to meet a premature baby’s needs for warmth, frequent breastfeeding, protection from infection, stimulation, safety and love. It also improves bonding between mothers and babies."
Preeclampsia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/preeclampsia,"Preeclampsia is one of the hypertensive (high blood pressure) disorders of pregnancy. It is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality (number of stillbirths and deaths of newborn in the first week of life) and morbidity.
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy occur in about 10% of all pregnant women around the world. Preeclampsia affects 3–5% of pregnancies. Along with preeclampsia, other diseases which are included in the group of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are eclampsia, gestational hypertension and chronic hypertension.
In Asia and Africa, nearly one tenth of all maternal deaths are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
In India, the incidence of preeclampsia is reported to be 8-10% among the pregnant women. According to a study, the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 7.8% with preeclampsia in 5.4% of the study population in India*.
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy specific hypertensive disease with multisystem involvement. It is a disorder of widespread vascular endothelial malfunction and vasospasm that occurs after 20 weeks of gestation and can present as late as 4-6 weeks postpartum (after child birth).
According to the new guidelines given by American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) in 2013, the diagnosis of preeclampsia does not require the detection of high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) along with hypertension. Evidence shows that changes in kidney and liver can occur without signs of proteinuria, and the amount of protein in the urine does not predict how severely the disease will progress.
Preeclampsia is now to be diagnosed by persistent high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy or during the postpartum period and is associated with a lot of protein in the urine or the new development of decreased blood platelets, changes in thekidney or liver function, fluid in the lungs, or signs of brain disorder such as seizures and/or visualdisturbances.
HEELP syndrome and eclampsia are the serious complications of the preeclampsia. The majority of deaths related to preeclampsia can be prevented by providing timely and effective care to pregnant women presenting with such complications.","Although pathophysiological changes (e.g. inadequate placentation) exist from very early stages of the pregnancy, hypertension and proteinuria usually become apparent in the second half of pregnancy.
Symptoms of preeclampsia-

Hypertension (High blood pressure): the presence of (a) a systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg or higher, on two occasions at least 4 hours apart in a previously normotensive patient,OR 

(b)SBP greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or a DBP greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg or higher (In this case, hypertension can be confirmed within minutes to facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy).

Proteinuria (Protein in urine): proteinuria of greater than or equal to 0.3 grams in a 24-hour urine specimen, a protein (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL) ratio of 0.3 or higher, or a urine dipstick protein of 1+ (if a quantitative measurement is unavailable) is required to diagnose preeclampsia.
Oedema: Swelling of the hands and face, especially around the eyes (swelling of the feet is more common in late pregnancy and probably not a sign of preeclampsia).
Sudden weight gain: Weight gain of more than five pounds in a week.
Headache: Dull or severe, throbbing headache, unrelieved by regular analgesics.
Nausea or vomiting, especially suddenly, after mid pregnancy (not the morning sickness that many women experience in early pregnancy).
Abdominal pain: epigastric or in upper right quadrant region, usually under the ribs.
Changes in vision like seeing spots or flashing lights; blurred vision, partial or total loss of eyesight.
Difficulty in breathing, gasping, or panting.
Hyperreflexia

Severe hypertension, hyperreflexia , headache (increasing frequency, unrelieved by regular analgesics) , clouding of vision , oliguria (passing less than 400ml urine in 24 hours) , upper abdominal pain (epigastric pain or pain in right upper quadrant) , pulmonary oedema (difficulty in breathing) are the signs of severe preeclampsia.","Causes-
The pathogenesis of preeclampsia is only partially understood and it is related to disturbances in placentation at the beginning of pregnancy, followed by generalized inflammation and progressive endothelial damage.
Risk factors-

Primigravida specially in adolescents and women over 35 years of age
Obesity
High blood pressure or preeclampsia in an earlier pregnancy:

(The risk of preeclampsia recurrence increases with earlier gestational age at the first delivery complicated by preeclampsia and with increasing maternal body mass index.)

Having a family history of preeclampsia: Among women who have had preeclampsia, about 20% to 40% of their daughters and 11% to 37% of their sisters may get the disorder.
Chronic high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy.
Preeclampsia is more common among women who have histories of certain health conditions, such as diabetes, urinary tract infections, migraine headaches, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, periodontal diseases (gum disease), polycystic ovary syndrome, multiple sclerosis, gestational diabetes, and sickle cell disease.
Preeclampsia is also more common in pregnancies resulting from egg donation, donor insemination, orin vitro fertilization.
Conditions leading to hyperplacentation and large placentas (such as multiple pregnancy, hydatidiform mole, polyhydramnios, hydrops fetalis).","Diagnostic criteria for Preeclampsia (ACOG):
Blood pressure:

Systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher on two occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation in a woman with a previously normal blood pressure.
Systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg or higher. Hypertension can be confirmed within a short interval (minutes) to facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy.

And
Proteinuria:

Greater than or equal to 300mg per 24-hour urine collection( or this amount extrapolated from a timed collection) or
Protein/creatinine ratio greater than or equal to 0.3
Dip stick reading of 1+( used only if other quantitative methods not available)

Or in the absence of proteinuria, new-onset hypertension with the new onset of any of the following:
Thrombocytopenia- Platelet count less than100,000/microliter
Renal insufficiency- Serum creatinine concentrations greater than1.1mg/dL or a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration in the absence of other renal disease.
Impaired liver function: Elevated blood concentrations of liver transaminases to twice normal concentration.
Pulmonary edema
Cerebral or visual symptoms
According to the new ACOG guidelines 2013, the diagnosis of preeclampsia no longer requires the detection of high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria). Preeclampsia is now to be diagnosed by persistent high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy or during the postpartum period that is associated with a lot of protein in the urine or the new development of decreased blood platelets, trouble with thekidney or liver, fluid in the lungs, or signs of brain trouble such as seizures and/or visualdisturbances.
Tests advised for evaluation of progress of preeclampsia are: 
Blood tests: includes tests for liver and kidney function test, total number of red blood cells, platelet count, and clotting test. 
Urine analysis: the dipstick test greater than 1+ protein on a random urine sample(used only if other quantitative methods not available), however single sample of urine, or several urine samples collected over a 24-hour period can be used to determine for protein and creatinine whenever possible.
Ultrasonography is used to assess the status of the fetus as well as to evaluate growth of foetus. Apart from transabdominal ultrasonography, umbilical artery Doppler ultrasonography can be performed to assess blood flow for detection of perinatal growth restriction and prematurity.
Nonstress test or biophysical profile:A nonstress test is a simple procedure that checks how baby's heart rate changes when baby moves inside the uterus. A biophysical profile is a prenatal ultrasound evaluation of foetal wellbeing involving a scoring system. It combines a foetal ultrasound with a nonstress test to provide more information about baby's breathing, muscle tone, movement and the volume of amniotic fluid around the foetus.","Management of pregnant women with preeclampsia without severe features aims with first consideration of safety of women and her foetus and second with delivery of a mature newborn that will not require intensive or prolonged neonatal care. It depends on the results of maternal and fetal evaluation, gestational age, presence of labour, or rupture of membranes, vaginal bleeding and wishes of the women.
Antepartum management-
Once the diagnosis has made as pregnancy with preeclampsia, women should be evaluated for complete blood count with platelet count, serum creatinine and liver enzyme levels, urine protein (24-hour collection or protein/creatinine ratio). Foetal evaluation can be done with ultrasonography (foetal weight and amniotic fluid index), nonstress test (NST) and biophysical profile (if NST is non reactive).
Management can occur in hospital or at home with restricted activity and serial maternal and foetal evaluation (continued evaluation).
Continued evaluation consists of following:
Foetal evolution:
Daily kick count, ultrasonography for foetal growth every three weeks, amniotic fluid volume assessment once weekly, NST twice weekly ,bio physical profile( if NST non reactive). (Frequency of these tests can be changed according to clinical findings.)
Maternal evaluation:
Blood pressure assessment: additional BP determination can be done at home or clinic.
Laboratory investigations for CBC, liver enzyme, serum creatinine levels should be done at least once a week.(frequency of these tests can be changed according to clinical finding)
Patients should have a regular diet with no salt restriction.
Women are instructed to report symptoms of severe preeclampsia (severe headaches, visual changes, epigartic pain, and shortness of breath) at each subsequent visit.
Women are advised to immediately come to the hospital/referred to the hospital if they develop persistent symptoms, abdominal pain, contractions, vaginal spotting, rupture of membrane, or decreased foetal movement.                                                                   
The development of new symptoms or signs suggesting severe preeclampsia or severe hypertension (systolic BP of 160 mm Hg or higher, or diastolic BP of 110 mm Hg or higher on repeat measurement) or evidence of foetal growth restriction, increased amount of liver enzymes or decreased platelet count requires immediate hospitalization.
Antihypertensive therapy: There was insufficient evidence about role of antihypertensive drugs on improvements of foetal and maternal out comes in non severe hypertension,( the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines recommended treatment at BP levels at 150 mm Hg systolic or 100 mm Hg diastolic, or both).
Bed rest: There may be situations in which different levels of rest, either at home or in the hospital may be indicated for individual women. Prolonged bed rest for the duration of pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolism (formation of a clot (thrombus) in a blood vessel that may break loose and may obstruct another vessel).
Timing of delivery: In women with preeclampsia without severe features between 34 weeks of gestation and 37 weeks of gestation should be in favour of continued monitoring and delivery to 37 completed weeks of gestation ( in the absence of abnormal foetal testing or other severe conditions such as premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour, or vaginal bleeding).
Delivery is indicated in the following conditions:

37 or more weeks of gestation
Suspected abruptio placentae (detachment of placenta from uterus)
34 weeks or more of gestation, plus any one of the following:
Progressive labour or rupture of membranes
Ultrasonographic estimate of foetal weight less than fifth percentile
Oligohydramnios (less amount of amniotic fluid )
Persistent biophysical profile 6/10 or less (upper limit 10/10)

In women with preeclampsia, a delivery decision should not be based on the amount of proteinuria or change in the amount of proeteinuria only, but all other indicated tests should be kept under consideration
Magnesium sulfate prophylaxis should be initiated if there is progression to severe disease.
Management of Severe preeclampsia-
For women with preeclampsia with severe hypertension during pregnancy (sustained systolic BP of at least 160 mm of Hg or diastolic BP of at least 110 mm Hg),the use of anti hypertensive therapy is recommended.
In pregnancy with severe preeclampsia, the parenteral (intravenous/intramuscular) administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended.
In women with severe preeclampsia at term, early delivery is recommended.
For women with severe preeclampsia at less than 34 weeks of gestation with stable maternal and foetal conditions, it is advised that pregnancy should be continued at facilities with adequate maternal and neonatal intensive care units. Whenever there is an indication, delivery may be considered. 
For women with severe preeclampsia at or beyond 34 weeks of gestation and with unstable maternal and foetal conditions irrespective of gestational age, quick delivery is recommended after maternal stabilization.
Pregnancy with severe preeclampsia before 23-24 weeks of gestation, delivery after maternal stabilization is recommended. Expectant management is not advised.
Antenatal corticosteroid administration should be considered in women with severe preeclampsia receiving expectant management at 34 weeks or less of gestation for foetal lung maturity.
The mode of delivery: should be determined by foetal gestational age, foetal presentation, cervical status, and maternal- foetal condition."
Pellucid Marginal Degeneration,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/pellucid-marginal-degeneration,"Pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD) is a bilateral (may be asymmetric), progressive, inferior crescentic peripheral thinning of the cornea. There is no vascularisation, infiltration or scarring in the area of involved cornea. Band of thinning measures about 1 to 2mm in width and extends from 4 to 8 o’clock position (about 6 to 8mm), leaving a normal band of 1 to 2mm from the limbus. The condition affects both men and women between 20 to 40 years of age. The condition results in high irregular astigmatism and rarely may develop acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous humour through breaks in Descemet’s membrane) or even perforation. It differs from keratoconus in that it has no iron ring, its thinning is in inferior part without a cone; and the corneal protrusion is located above (rather than) in the area of thinning. Pellucid marginal degeneration and keratoconus may exist in the same eye and in different eyes of the same patient. This association in the same patient suggests that pellucid marginal degeneration, keratoconus and keratoglobus (generalised thinning and globular protrusion of the cornea) may be varying spectrum of the same pathophysiology rather than separate disease processes. The central cornea is usually of normal thickness, and the epithelium overlying the area of thinning is intact. Rarely, it may involve superior part of cornea.
Schalaeppi (1957), coined the term pellucid marginal degeneration to describe a progressive and non-inflammatory peripheral corneal thinning disorder. The word ‘pellucid’, meaning clear, was used to denote the clarity of the cornea in this condition despite the presence of ectasia.
The cause of pellucid marginal degeneration is not clearly established, but collagen abnormalities such as that occur in keratoconus have been reported. The condition is rare, but there may be a considerable underestimation of the incidence because these patients are often misdiagnosed as having keratoconus. Early cases of pellucid marginal degeneration may be diagnosed with corneal topography/videokeratography (maps the surface curvature of the cornea) only.","Pellucid marginal degeneration is usually asymptomatic except for visual deterioration.
Symptoms may be:

Gradual progressive deterioration in vision.
Longstanding poor vision.

Rarer symptoms are:

Sudden scleral injection.
Acute pain.
Sudden reduction in vision and photophobia (due to acute hydrops and/or spontaneous corneal perforation).
Corneal oedema.","The exact cause of pellucid marginal degeneration is not clear and it is not known whether PMD, keratoconus, and keratoglobus are distinct diseases or phenotypic variations of the same disorder. Due to the concomitant presence of PMD with keratoconus in the same eye, many have proposed that PMD is a peripheral form of keratoconus.
To date, there is no evidence that PMD is genetically inherited.
Several conditions have been reported in patients with PMD, but none of them show an obvious pathogenic association.
Associated conditions: 

Chronic open angle glaucoma.
Retinal lattice degeneration.
Scleroderma.
Retinitis pigmentosa.
Keratoconjunctivitis.
Eczema.
Hyperthyroidism.

The exact pathophysiology of PMD has not been ascertained, but it is thought to be secondary to collagen abnormalities of cornea, similar to keratoconus.","Diagnosis depends upon history, slit-lamp examination, pachymetry (measures thickness of the cornea) and corneal topography.
Patients with PMD typically present with progressive reduction in vision or longstanding poor vision, resulting from large magnitude of irregular, against-the-rule astigmatism. Against-the-rule astigmatism is the condition in which horizontal meridian is steepest and it can be corrected by a minus cylinder in the vertical axis or the plus cylinder in the horizontal axis. There may be sudden reduction in vision and photophobia due to acute hydrops, being produced by breaks in Descemet’s membrane.
PMD is a bilateral condition but unilateral cases have also been described. This condition most commonly involves inferior cornea, but involvement of superior, nasal and temporal quadrants of cornea has been reported as well.
Clinical signs of PMD:

Refraction and keratometry: Refraction and keratometry shows against-the-rule astigmatism.
PMD features: PMD is characterised by a typical narrow, clear band of corneal thinning about 1 to 2mm in width which extends from 4-o’clock position to 8-o’clock position (6 to 8mm in size). The degree of thinning is usually severe and may cause up to 80% loss of stromal tissue. Between limbus and thinned band-like region there is typically a 1 to 2mm wide region of uninvolved normal cornea which is usually clear. The corneal protrusion is most marked just superior to the area of thinning and usually with normal thickness of the central cornea. Descemet’s folds, usually concentric with the inferior limbus, may develop which disappear with pressure on the cornea.

Unlike keratoconus, PMD usually does not show signs of Fleischer’s ring, corneal infiltration, vascularisation, scarring or lipid deposition. Since there is no obvious cone, cornea does not exhibit Munson’s sign (a V-shaped deformation of the lower eyelid when the eye turns downward) or Rizutti’s sign (a sharply focussed beam of light near nasal limbus produced by lateral illumination of the temporal limbus).

Corneal topography or videokeratography: Corneal topography is the gold standard in detecting corneal ectasia. The use of topography allows the detection of early and subclinical ectasia which is important in diagnosis as well as in pre-operative corneal laser refractive surgery assessment. Videokeratography shows low corneal power along the central vertical axis which increases as the inferior cornea is approached, and high corneal power along the inferior oblique meridians. There are various topography devices like TMS-1 which uses pacido rings method, Orbscan II utilises slit-scanning and Placido ring reflection, Oculus Pentacam uses Scheimpflug photography for topography with pachymetry, and Visante Omni combines Placido ring and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for topography with pachymetry. The hallmark of corneal topography in PMD is an obvious flattening of the cornea along the vertical meridian. Inferior-central cornea in PMD shows a ‘beer-belly’ appearance when viewed from the side. Topography shows that this inferior peripheral steepening extends into the mid-peripheral, inferior oblique corneal meridians in a classic ‘crab-claw’, ‘butterfly’ or ‘kissing doves’ appearance.


Classification or stages of PMD:
Being a rare disorder no clearly defined, guidelines have been proposed to categorise the severity of the condition. However, the ectatic process advances over time and it is suggested to have three stages:

Mild.
Moderate.
Advanced.


Histopathology:
Light microscopy may show irregularity in epithelium with oedema, increase in stromal mucopolysaccharides as well as an irregular Bowman’s membrane with ruptures at places. There may be folds in Descemet’s membrane and stromal thinning.
Electron microscopy may show breaks in Bowman’s layer, irregular arrangement of stroma with the presence of extracellular, granular electron-dense deposits. There is absence of inflammatory cells.
Scanning electron microscopy may reveal unusual electron-dense areas of fibrous long-spacing collagen in the peripheral thinned areas, scattered amongst regions of mostly normal collagen.

Differential diagnosis:
PMD is most frequently misdiagnosed as the more common corneal ectatic condition of keratoconus.

Keratoconus: Keratoconus is characterised by para-central corneal thinning and ectasia so that the cornea takes the shape of a cone. Pellucid marginal degeneration may be differentiated from keratoconus in most cases by the inferior band like location of the thinning on slit lamp (bio-microscopy) examination and by the classic butterfly pattern on videokeratography. In contrast to keratoconus, patients with pellucid marginal degeneration have no iron ring, no Vogt striae, and no central corneal thinning or scarring of the protruding cornea, and corneal protrusion is located above rather than in the area of thinning.
Keratoglobus: Keratolobus causes circumferential 360˚ thinning of the cornea, more marked at the limbus, and the entire cornea protrudes compared with regional thinning in keratoconus and inferior paralimbal thinning in pellucid marginal degeneration. Corneas with keratoglobus usually show diffuse thinning, varying from one-third to one-fifth of the normal corneal thickness at the mid-peripheral area. Vogt’s striae, sub-epithelial scarring, Fleischer’s ring, lipid deposition and corneal vascularisation are rarely found in the corneas with keratoglobus. The cornea can also become opaque and oedematous from breaks in Descemet’s membrane.
Terrien’s marginal degeneration: Terrien’s marginal degeneration is a non-inflammatory condition characterised by slowly progressive, bilateral, marginal corneal ectasia typically beginning superiorly which can then progress circumferentially. Terrien’s marginal degeneration most commonly affects males in their mid-twenties. Early signs on slit lamp examination include marginal opacification with peripheral vascularisation. Marginal thinning then begins parallel to the limbus, forming a ‘gutter-like furrow’ in the clear gap between opacification and limbus. Epithelium remains intact and does not ulcerate over the furrow and lipid deposition occurs as the furrow deepens. Pseudo-pterygium may develop near the furrowed area. As the disease continues, the thinning may extend to the inferior cornea, sparing the interpalpebral periphery. There is relative steepening of interpalpebral peripheral cornea, resulting in against-the-rule or oblique astigmatism. Terrien’s marginal degeneration progresses very slowly, frequently taking several years. Vast majority of patients with Terrien’s marginal degeneration complain of mild, intermittent ocular irritation only. Very rarely does it causes acute ocular inflammation with pain.
Furrow degeneration: Furrow degeneration, like pellucid marginal degeneration has an intact epithelium and the area of corneal thinning is not vascularised, at least in the acute phase. The area of thinning in furrow degeneration is much closer to the limbus with virtually no intervening zone of normal cornea. Furrow degeneration may on occasion involve superior part of cornea, and there may be an associated adjacent area of scleritis. The edges of the furrow are steeper than the gradual attenuation seen in pellucid marginal degeneration, and there may be a corneal infiltrate adjacent to the area of thinning. Furrow degeneration may have strong association with rheumatoid arthritis.
Mooren’s ulcer: Mooren’s ulcer, an idiopathic peripheral corneal melting disorder, is characterised by associated severe pain and may be accompanied by an epithelial defect over the area of thinning. It may be accompanied by corneal vascularisation adjacent to the area of thinning in the acute phase. Usually the site of involvement is the inferior limbus, with the ulceration then spreading circumlimbally and then centrally, eventually involving the entire cornea. At the end stages of Mooren’s ulcer, there is vascularisation and scarring of cornea with stromal thinning to less than half of the original corneal thickness.
Rheumatologic disorder affecting cornea: Rheumatologic disorder affecting cornea is also a peripheral melting disorder. It is characterised by pain and may be accompanied by an epithelial defect over the area of thinning. It may also be accompanied by corneal vascularisation adjacent to the area of thinning in the acute phase.
Contact lens-induced warping of cornea: Contact lens-induced warping of cornea may mimic the appearance of pellucid marginal degeneration on corneal topography.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical therapy:
Vast majority of patients with PMD are managed by medical therapy.
Management of PMD is dependent on the severity of the disease.
Mild stage:

Spectacle correction: To begin with in the early mild stages of the disease, spectacle correction is prescribed. Patients with high astigmatism may be prescribed with high refractive index sphero-cylindrical glasses.
Soft (hydro gel) toric contact lenses: Soft toric (lenses for astigmatism) contact lenses may be useful in the early mild stages of the condition only, usually before the progression of irregular astigmatism. Hybrid (rigid gas permeable and hydro gel combined) contact lenses viz. Saturn II lenses, SoftPerm lenses and SynergEyes lenses have also been used.

Moderate stage:

Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses may be required for moderate cases of PMD. Large amount of irregular against-the-rule astigmatism results in unstable lens centration and excessive inferior edge stand-off. Therefore, larger-diameter RGP lenses may provide satisfactory lens stability and tolerance with good visual acuity. ‘Bi-toric’ RGP contact lenses have also been used successfully. Specialised back surface design lenses may correct large amounts of corneal astigmatism and may provide good visual acuity. RGP and soft contact lens with ‘sector management control’ allow peripheral lens geometry to be customised to complement the anterior surface of the ectatic cornea.

Advanced stage:

Rigid gas permeable (RGP) scleral contact lenses: In advanced stages, adequate RGP lens centration may be difficult to achieve as additional corneal steepening increases the possibility of lens dislocation with blinking. Rigid gas permeable (RGP) scleral contact lenses have certain advantages.


Advantages of scleral contact lenses are:
- They are supported by the sclera thus reducing lid sensation.
- They provide good centration, thus high-powered lenses remain static.
- They are unlikely to dislodge upon blinking.
- They vault the area of the cornea affected by the disease making irregular topography less of a problem to fit.
- There is less risk of foreign body entrapment.

Disadvantages of scleral contact lenses are:
- Poor oxygen transfer to cornea.
- Difficulties in application as compared to corneal RGP lenses.
- Complicated manufacturing processes.
- Relatively few practitioners are experienced in fitting such lenses.

Surgical therapy: 

Keratoplasty: Keratoplasty is considered for patients with PMD whose vision is inadequate with contact lenses or for patients who are intolerant to lens.

Penetrating keratoplasty: In general, patients with PMD are usually poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty as the corneal thinning occurs close to the limbus. As a result, large eccentric grafts are required and must be positioned very close to the limbus thus increasing the chances of graft rejection, suture-induced complications and corneal neovascularisation. Penetrating keratoplasty also induces large amounts of post-operative astigmatism which may be difficult to correct due to variation in the graft-host thickness.
Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): In deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), the anterior third to two-thirds of the cornea is replaced with donor tissue.
Lamellar crescentic keratoplasty: In lamellar crescentic keratoplasty, crescent-shaped donor lamellar cornea is used. Lamellar crescentic keratoplasty was used earlier to treat PMD.
Lamellar thermo- keratoplasty (LTK): Lamellar thermo-keratoplasty (LTK) is an adaptation of lamellar crescentic keratoplasty. This involves thermal shrinkage of the host lamellar bed, prior to the placement and suturing of the crescent-shaped donor lamellar cornea.
Lamellar crescentic resection (LCR): Lamellar crescentic resection (LCR) involves excision of the abnormally thinned stroma and then re-approximation of the near-normal thickness edges. The major advantage is that no donor tissue is required.
Corneal wedge excision/resection: Corneal wedge excision/resection is similar to lamellar crescentic resection, except that it involves full thickness corneal tissue removal followed by re-apposition of the remaining normal thickness cornea using sutures.
Epikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty is a rare form of surgery used for PMD. This is a type of on-lay lamellar keratoplasty in which a lens made of human corneal tissue is sutured onto the anterior surface of the cornea to change its anterior curvature and refraction.
‘Tuck-in’ lamellar keratoplasty: ‘Tuck-in’ lamellar keratoplasty refers to a central lamellar keratoplasty with intrastromal tucking of the peripheral flange.

Intra-stromal corneal ring segment inserts (INTACS): Intrastromal corneal ring segment inserts (INTACS) helps in reducing the myopia and astigmatism and improving spectacle- corrected visual acuity. Intrastromal corneal ring segment inserts (INTACS) involves incorporation of two semi-circular plastic rings into the peripheral corneal stroma. In PMD, the ectatic corneal tissue has a thinner structure and is potentially more easily flattened as compared to normal eyes.
Combined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking: Combined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking consists of photo-polymerisation of corneal stroma by combining vitamin B2 (photosensitising substance) with UVA. This process increases rigidity of corneal collagen and thus reduces the likelihood of further ectasia.
Toric phakic intraocular lens (TPIOL): The use of toric phakic intraocular lens (TPIOL) has also been reported.

PMD patients presenting with acute hydrops or corneal perforation may be treated with glue tissue adhesive, bandage soft contact lenses, crescentic lamellar keratoplasty, penetrating keratoplasty or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty.

Prognosis:
Pellucid marginal degeneration progresses slowly over the years and may result in severe visual deterioration. Being rare, no large scale longitudinal studies are reported.
Since pellucid marginal degeneration affects corneal periphery, contact lens fitting and surgical correction is more difficult as compared to keratoconus."
Presbyopia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/presbyopia,"Presbyopia is the gradual age- related loss of accommodative amplitude which begins early in life and culminates in complete loss of accommodation by about 50 years of age. The word presbyopia is derived from the Greek words presbus (meaning old man) and ops (eye).
Accommodation is a dynamic, optical change in the dioptric power of the eye allowing the point of focus of the eye to be changed from distant to near objects. Accommodation is the ability to increase the refractive power of the optical system of eye. It occurs to produce a clear image of near objects. For accommodation, the ciliary body contracts, the lens zonules relax, and the crystalline lens assumes a more spherical shape, which increases its refractive power. Other than presbyopia, disorders that affect accommodation are quite rare. Regardless of the cause, it causes blurred vision for near objects and there is eyestrain with prolonged near work.
In an un-accommodated, emmetropic (with no refractive error) eye, distant objects at or beyond what is considered optical infinity for the eye (6 meters) are focused on the retina. For an object closer to the eye, the eye accommodates for a clearly focused image on the retina. Myopic eyes, being too long for the optical power, are unable to attain a sharply focused image for objects at optical infinity. Myopes can focus clearly on objects closer to the eye than optical infinity without accommodation (i.e. objects at their far point). In contrast, young hypermetropes are only able to focus clearly on objects at optical infinity through an accommodative increase in the optical power, provided their accommodative amplitude exceeds the amount of hypermetropia.
Optical requirements of accommodation: The optical power of the crystalline lens increases (i.e. the focal length of lens decreases) during accommodation. As a result, the eye changes focus from distance to near so that the image of near object focuses on retina. The dioptric change in power of the eye defines accommodation and accommodation is measured in units of dioptres (D). A dioptre is reciprocal of meter and is a measure of the vergence of light. Light rays converging towards a point image are designated to have positive vergence. An object at optical infinity subtends zero vergence at the cornea. Cornea and crystalline lens add positive vergence to bring light towards a focus on the retina. If the eye accommodates from an object at optical infinity to an object 1.0 meters in front of the eye, this represents 1.0 D of accommodation. If the eye accommodates from infinity to 0.5 meters in front of the eye, this is 2 D of accommodation. Thus, the accommodative response is the increase in optical power the eye undergoes, to change focus from an object at optical infinity to the near object.
The accommodative apparatus of the eye consists of ciliary muscle, ciliary body, choroid, anterior and posterior zonular fibers, the lens capsule and the crystalline lens.
Although presbyopia is age related, the age of onset varies around the world. For example, presbyopia develops earlier in people who live closer to the equator. Specifically, the age of onset of presbyopia is noted to be 37 years in India. Further studies show that the important variable is ambient temperature rather than latitude. Higher the ambient temperature, earlier is the onset of presbyopia.
Presbyopia (‘old- age sight’) occurs when the near point of accommodation recedes to a point where it is difficult or impossible to accommodate sufficiently for reading or other close work. For most people, close work becomes difficult when the amplitude of accommodation is less than 5 dioptres (corresponding to a near point of accommodation of 20 cm).
Once presbyopia occurs, it gradually increases over a period of 10 to 12 years and then stabilises. A presbyope usually requires a + 1.00 D (dioptres) of reading addition in the age of early forties, levelling off to about + 2.50 D at about the age of 55 years.","Patients with latent hypermetropia (far- sightedness) use a portion of their accommodative reserve to focus at distance, and may present with premature presbyopia. Mild myopia (short- sightedness), in contrast, may have delayed onset of symptoms of presbyopia.
Most disorders of accommodation are bilateral. Thus, if a patient is corrected to emmetropia, the amount of near blurring should be similar in each eye. Disorders that present as a unilateral loss of accommodation localise to the infra-nuclear third nerve, ciliary ganglion (Adie’s syndrome), effector ciliary body itself (pharmacological cycloplegia or paralysis of accommodation).
Accommodative disorders typically present with symptoms of:

Blurring of vision for near in both eyes.
Eyestrain.
Headache after prolonged focus.
Stinging.
Watering.
Increase in comfortable reading distance.
Trouble in focusing when tired.
Slow response to change in focus distance.
Running of letters and lines.

These symptoms are intensified under inadequate light conditions, poor contrast and are exaggerated at the end of the day.","Presbyopia is caused due to loss of the fine balance of forces that permit the accommodative structures to bring a change in optical power of the lens in the young eye.
With advancing age, there is decline in the ability of the eye to accommodate or change its focus.
Neural pathway for accommodation:
Accommodation is associated with convergence and miosis forming the triad of ‘near reflex’.
The neural pathway for accommodation probably originates in the caudal part of the Edinger- Westphal or third nerve parasympathetic nucleus in the midbrain. These areas receive input from the cerebral cortex and pretectum. Fibers from the third nerve nucleus, responsible for accommodation, then travel to the ciliary ganglion, where they synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic fibers going to ciliary body and iris sphincter. Then via short ciliary nerves, they reach to the intrinsic muscles of the eye.
Parasympathetic control is of much greater clinical importance. However, experiments have shown that the ciliary body receives sympathetic input as well. Since accommodation is mediated almost exclusively via parasympathetic pathways, it is antagonised best with muscarinic receptor (type of acetylcholine receptors) blockers. With muscarinic antagonists, paralysis of accommodation (cycloplegia) is always associated with dilatation of pupil (mydriasis).
Muscarinic antagonists commonly used are:

Tropicamide: Tropicamide has a very short half- life and should not be used to conduct cycloplegic refraction.
Cyclopentolate: Cyclopentolate has sufficient half- life and may be used for cycloplegic refraction, even in children.
Homatropine.
Scopolamine (hyoscine). 
Atropine.

Homatropine, scopolamine (hyoscine) and atropine are generally used for therapeutic (treatment) purposes.
There is great variability in the normal levels of accommodation. Accommodative ability decreases with age. Children have great accommodative capabilities and presbyopia is rare before thirty five years of age.
Mechanism of accommodation:
Helmholtz in 1855 provided the description of accommodative mechanism. When the young eye is un-accommodated and focused for distance, the ciliary muscle is relaxed. Resting tension on anterior zonular fibers inserting around the lens equator, apply an outward directed tension to hold the lens in a relatively flattened and un-accommodated state. For near focus, the ciliary muscle contracts, the inner apex of the ciliary body moves forward and towards the axis of the eye. This stretches the posterior attachment of the ciliary muscle and releases resting tension on all zonular fibers around the lens equator. The lens capsule then moulds and provides the force to cause the lens to become accommodated. The accommodative increase in optical power of the lens comes about from an increase in the lens anterior surface curvature, and to lesser extent, of the posterior surface curvatures.
When accommodative effort is over, the ciliary muscle relaxes and the elasticity of the posterior attachment of the choroid pulls the ciliary muscle back into its flattened and un-accommodated state. The outward movement of the apex of the ciliary body once again increases the tension on the anterior zonular fibers around the lens equator to pull the lens via the capsule into a flattened and un-accommodated form.
Alternative theory of mechanism of accommodation:
Schachar (1993) proposed that zonular tension is increased during accommodation in young subjects in contrast with the classic Helmholtz’s theory. The basic assumptions are:
- During near accommodation, the lens equator moves outward causing an increase in lens diameter.
- The equatorial lens diameter increases with age due to natural growth of the lens.
- Presbyopia is caused by decrease of the distance between lens equator and ciliary muscle leaving not enough space for the lens equator to move outward with accommodation.

Ocular changes resulting in presbyopia:
Changes that occur in the eye resulting in presbyopia are broadly divided into three categories:

Lens and lens capsule- based theories: Lens and lens capsule- based theories consider changes in the elasticity and compliance of the lens and its capsule. There is continued deposition of the lens fibers within the lens as it ages, causing the lens to become compact and stiff. A major factor in the loss of accommodation may be the increased stiffness of the ageing lens with inability to respond to accommodative stimuli. The near point of accommodation gradually recedes from about 7 cm at the age of 10 years to about 20 cm at the age of 40 years and it recedes further to about 40 cm at about the age of 50 years.
Extralenticular theories: Extralenticular theories consider changes in the ciliary muscle and choroid.
Geometric theories: Geometric theories consider changes in the geometry of the zonular attachments to the lens.


Other causes of diminished near vision are:

Uncorrected hypermetropia where all the accommodation is used for clear distant vision.
Use of local or systemic parasympatholytic drugs (e.g.atropine).
Aphakia and pseudo-phakia.
Internal ophthalmoplegia.","Diagnosing presbyopia is straightforward and age of the patient is a major consideration. A simple reading test using well- illuminated text of graded sizes at a standard distance may be helpful both in characterising the degree of near- vision and in determining the appropriate refractive power.
Accommodation may be measured by determining the accommodative amplitude or the accommodative range.
Monocular accommodative amplitude may be measured by following methods:

Subjective push- up method: Subjective push- up method involves a small target (like near letter chart) being brought forward toward the eye until it blurs. It is the near point of accommodation. The reciprocal of the distance at which the target blurs is the accommodative amplitude in dioptres.
Prince rule: Prince rule combines a scaled ruler with a near addition of + 3 D (dioptres), and it puts the far point of an emmetrope (a person with no refractive error) at 33 cm. The target on Prince rule is brought forward until it blurs. Taking account of addition of + 3, this distance is converted into dioptres of accommodative amplitude.
Negative powered trial lenses: The test uses a distance letter chart and lenses of increasing minus spherical power to induce accommodation. More minus sphere is added until the subject can no longer overcome the minus lenses with accommodation. The amount of minus sphere that can be overcome represents the accommodative amplitude.

Accurate objective measurements of accommodation may be done statically or dynamically with auto-refractors, refractometers or aberrometers. Dynamic optometers provide a real-time graphic display of the accommodative response and can provide an indication of how much the accommodative response varies over time. Objective methods provide a true measure of accommodative amplitude of the eye.
Accommodation may also be stimulated by topically applied muscarinic agonists (e.g. pilocarpine) and the resulting accommodative response measured periodically over 30- 45 minutes using a refractometer or an auto-refractor until the maximal accommodative response is attained.
Assessment of accommodative range:

Accommodative range: Accommodative range refers to the range of distances which can be viewed clearly by using accommodation. It is expressed without correction for emmetropia. A + 2 hypermetrope with 4 D of accommodation would have an uncorrected accommodative range from infinity to 50 cm. A minus 2 myope with similar accommodative amplitude would have an accommodative range from 50 cm to about 17 cm.


Differential Diagnosis:
Presbyopia is the most common cause of accommodative dysfunction.
Presbyopia should be differentiated from other conditions with decreased accommodation like:

Trauma along neuro-anatomical pathway: Trauma to the parasympathetic nuclei in the midbrain, to supra-nuclear structures, or to the third nerve may produce symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain).
Adie’s syndrome: Adie’s syndrome is characterised by one eye with a pupil that is larger than normal and constricts slowly in bright light (tonic pupil), along with the absence of deep tendon reflexes, usually in the Achilles tendon. Adie’s syndrome is usually associated with decrease in accommodation.
Pharmacological cycloplegia: Pharmacological cycloplegia also produces temporary accommodative dysfunction.
Systemic medications: Systemic medications may cause decrease in accommodation. These medicines often have anti-cholinergic side effects. Examples include phenothiazines and anti-parkinsonian drugs.

Unlike presbyopia, increased accommodation is rarely seen as in:

Horner Syndrome: Several experiments have shown that ciliary body also receives sympathetic input. This is shown clinically by the increased accommodative amplitude seen in the affected eye of patients with Horner Syndrome.
Miotic agents: Miotic agents such as pilocarpine may cause an abnormally proximal near point.
Accommodative spasm: Accommodative spasm is a functional disorder characterised by blurred vision for distance, diplopia, episodic esotropia (inward turning of eye), miosis (small pupil), and an abnormal near point of accommodation.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
It is important to correct refractive error properly to put the far point at infinity so that ocular system is emmetropic for distance.
Medical therapy:
Management of presbyopia involves use of plus lenses for near work either in a bifocal or as reading glasses only. Most problems with reading addition of plus glasses result from over- correction for the near distance.
Correction to emmetropia and the use of trial frames to determine the proper power give good results.

Spectacle correction: Reading glasses, bifocals, progressive glasses, and even trifocals, are the most common methods of correction for eyes that can no longer focus on near objects, and are the most versatile option.
Contact lenses: Different contact lenses are available for the presbyopes. These are either bifocal or multifocal contact lenses, but these have received a mixed response by the users. An additional alternative is mono-vision contact lenses, where the refractive power of one eye is set for focus at a distance and the other eye for focusing near objects. Although image is clear for each eye, there is concomitant loss of depth perception. A general drawback to the use of contact lens for presbyopia is the decrease in tear production with ageing.

Surgical refractive presbyopia management:
Natural accommodation has both accommodative and pseudo-accommodative components. Accommodation (i.e. real change in optical power) should be distinguished from the ability to see clearly for near. Depth of focus bifocality or multifocality (e.g. multifocal intraocular lens) may provide a variable degree of functional near vision. Such vision is known as pseudo-accommodation.
Treatment may be performed by replacing the crystalline lens with a multifocal lens after cataract surgery. If the crystalline lens is still clear, it may be preferable to treat presbyopia in a way that allows for preserving lens.
I. Pseudo-accommodative procedures:

Mono-vision: Mono-vision refers to correcting dominant one eye to emmetropia and the other to myopia between minus 1 and minus 2 D, which can be achieved by excimer laser surgery. In hypermetropia, a steepening of the cornea with overcorrection of one eye may be performed by laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK). The limitation of mono-vision is the lack of a possibility for correction of intermediate distance vision without simultaneously affecting near and distance vision.
Multifocal excimer laser: Multifocal corneal ablation with laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is currently used almost exclusively in hypermetropic and emmetropic eyes.
Intra-corneal implants: Exact control of the lamellar corneal cut is obtained with microkeratome and femtosecond laser technologies. Benefit of these intra-corneal implants is their reversibility. If the implant is not well tolerated, or cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is to be performed later, it can be removed, thereby restoring the original shape of the cornea.
Multifocal intraocular (IOL) lenses: 

- Refractive multifocal IOLs: Refractive bifocal or multifocal IOLs have on their optic two or more ring- shaped spherical zones of different refraction. The near part is usually located in the center of the lens optic. With accommodative miosis, the near part comes into play when looking at near targets, and the distance part when looking at far points. Efficacy of this depends on the centration of the IOL and diameter of the pupil.
- Diffractive multifocal IOLs: Diffractive multifocal IOLs part away the light to two focus points, one for near and one for distance. They have a diffractive anterior or posterior surface with concentric rings for the diffraction of incoming light rays, which are focused onto a far and a near point. The bifocality is largely independent of pupil diameter and centration.
Some modern multifocal IOLs use a combination of refractive and diffractive principles.
II. Accommodative procedures:

Anterior ciliary sclerotomy and sclera expansion: Anterior ciliary sclerotomy and sclera expansion procedure is based on alternative theory of the mechanism of accommodation, proposed by Schachar. Accordingly, it seems logical to increase this space for the lens equator to move outward.
Potentially accommodating IOLs: Accommodating IOLs are designed to transform the movement of the ciliary muscle into a dynamic change of ocular dioptric power. Accommodative IOLs are based on the principle of optic shift. Haptic (which hold the lens in place) contraction of the ciliary muscle is supposed to shift the IOL optic anteriorly. This allows for only small accommodative amplitude.


Prognosis:
Most patients with symptoms of eye strain do well with plus power glasses for reading. Plus power requirements increase until patients attain the age of early sixties, and then stabilise."
Premenstrual syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/premenstrual-syndrome,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common health problem in women in reproductive age.PMS refers to the changes in female’s mood along with certain physical symptoms relating to her menstrual cycle that are significant enough to affect her quality of life.
PMS can be clinically recognized as chronic disorder that impairs relationships, work productivity, and social activities. In a population based study 91% of the participants reported at least one symptom, 10.3% had PMS and 3.1% fulfilled the criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Both PMS and PMDD were strongly associated with poor physical health and psychological distress*.
A cross-sectional survey in Gujarat, India among college students also showed that 91.4% participants had, at least, one premenstrual symptom of any given severity (mild to severe) in at least more than or equal to half of the menstrual cycles during last 12 months duration.
The most commonly reported symptom was “fatigue/lack of energy” (68.3%), followed by “decrease interest in work” (60.1%) and “anger/irritability” (59.9%)**.
Risk factors for PMS/PMDD include stress, genetic factors, obesity, other health problems, a history of depression or anxiety disorder, or other psychiatric disorders. A healthy life style consisting of healthy diet and proper physical exercise is the first step to preventing and managing PMS.","Symptoms of PMS have been reported to affect as many as 90% of women of reproductive age, sometime during their lives. Symptoms occur during the two weeks before a woman's period starts, known as the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms typically become more intense in the two to three days prior to the period and usually resolve after the first day or two of flow. Symptoms vary from woman to woman. Symptoms may occur in the form of following changes-

Mood: Anxiety, nervousness, mood swings, irritability, forgetfulness, confusion, depression, insomnia.
Behaviour- Cravings for sweets, increased eating, crying, poor concentration, sensitivity to noise, changes in alcohol tolerance.
Physical- Headache, palpitations, fatigue, weight gain, bloating, breast swelling and tenderness, constipation or diarrhea, dizziness.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): This is a more severe condition than PMS. While the mood symptoms are similar to the mood symptoms of PMS, they are worse and cause more problems. The physical symptoms of PMS may or may not be present.","The definitive cause of PMS is unknown, however following etiologies are postulated based on recent research such as-

Serotonin deficiency, because patients who are most affected by PMS have deficient serotonin levels;
Magnesium and calcium deficiencies, as supplementation show improvement in physical and emotional symptoms.
Exaggerated response to normal hormonal changes; although levels of estrogen and progesterone are similar to those of women without PMS.
Abuse (emotional, sexual, or physical) in early life places women at higher risk for PMS in the middle-to-late reproductive years.

Risk factors- Obesity and smoking are the risk factors for PMS. Research reveals that women with a body mass index (BMI) of 30kg/m2 or above are nearly three times as likely to have PMS as women who are not obese. Women who smoke cigarettes are likely to have more severe PMS symptoms.
PMS affects women with ovulatory cycles. Older adolescents tend to have more severe symptoms than younger adolescents do. Women in their fourth decade of life tend to be affected most severely. PMS completely resolves at menopause.","Diagnosis of PMS is done clinically according to symptoms and by ruling out other conditions having similar symptoms such as depression, anxiety, peri-menopause, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, thyroid disease. Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common conditions that overlap with PMS however; in these conditions symptoms are present all month long and may worsen before or during the periods.
Keeping a record of symptoms can help health care provider to decide about PMS. The health care practitioner may ask the patient to keep accurate records or diary of symptoms throughout the next month or two. These records give the patient and health care professional a better understanding of the symptoms and how they relate to the patient's menstrual cycle. Some of the diagnostic signs are-

symptoms are present four–five days before the period for at least three menstrual cycles in a row;
symptoms subside with first day or two after period starts;
symptoms interfere with some of normal activities;
There are no lab tests that can confirm a diagnosis of PMS.","If symptoms of PMS are mild to moderate, they can be relieved by life style changes that mainly include healthy diet and exercise. Behavioral counseling and stress management may help the patients regain control during times of high emotional disturbances.
Healthy diet-Simple changes in diet may help relieve the symptoms of PMS:

Eat a diet rich in whole grains like whole grain bread, pasta, cereals, barley, brown rice and beans and lentils. Whole grains contain complex carbohydrates that reduce mood symptoms and food cravings.
Add fruits, leafy green vegetables and low fat cheese, yogurt and milk to your diet (calcium rich foods).
Reduce intake of fat, salt, and sugar.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol.
Eat six small meals a day rather than three large ones, or eat slightly less at three meals and add three light snacks. These modifications will keep blood sugar level stable and will help with symptoms.
Drink plenty of fluids (water or juice, not soft drinks, alcohol, or other beverages with caffeine).

Exercise- Exercise regularly and not just during the days that symptoms are there. At least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise most days of the week helps in reducing PMS symptoms. Aerobic exercise includes brisk walking, running, cycling, and swimming, increases heart rate and lung function. It may reduce fatigue and depression.
Relaxation techniques- Areas of stress should be identified and finding ways to relax and reduce stress can decrease the PMS symptoms. Relaxation techniques that include breathing exercises, meditation, and yoga may help in managing pre menstrual symptoms.
Getting enough sleep with regular sleeping habits is important in healthy life style modifications. Regular sleeping habits means wake up and go to sleep at the same time every day, including weekends.
Dietary supplements in the form of calcium, magnesium, vitamin E may help reduce symptoms of PMS.
Quit smoking if you smoke.
If symptoms are so intense that interfere with the routine life, consult the doctor. In severe cases medicines may be recommended that include-
(a) Hormonal contraceptives: these are the drugs that prevent ovulation and may be effective in relieving physical symptoms.
(b) Antidepressants- These drugs can help lessen mood symptoms.
(c) Anti-anxiety drugs- If anxiety is a major PMS symptom, these drugs may be used.
(d) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce pain. Long term use of NSAIDs is not recommended.
(e) Diuretics are drugs that help the body to lose excess water through the kidneys. These medicines have been used to reduce weight gain, breast swelling, and bloating associated with PMS."
Pseudophakia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/pseudophakia,"Pseudophakia refers to the presence of an intraocular lens (IOL) implant. The IOL may be inserted at the time of cataract surgery for the removal of crystalline lens or it may be put as a secondary procedure to correct aphakia. The IOL may be placed in the anterior chamber (anterior-chamber IOL) or posterior chamber (posterior-chamber IOL).
Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the crystalline lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.
Emmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.
The term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.
Prevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers.
IOLs are made up of acrylic or quality Perspex i.e. poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA). The lenses are about 4- 6 mm in diameter and are biconvex or plano- convex. Lens power calculations for primary implantation necessitate axial length measurement with ultrasonography, keratometry and the use of standard tables. A stronger lens may be required in children. Lens loops are usually made up of flexible methyl-methacrylate. Foldable IOLs made up of silicone or various polymers of acrylic are also available for insertion through a small incision following cataract surgery by phacoemulsification.
A patient who needs 12.5 D in aphakic spectacles would need about 21 D of an IOL in posterior chamber of eye. The average magnification of an IOL in posterior chamber is about 1.5%, compared with the original crystalline lens. For an anterior chamber IOL the average power is about 18 D, and the magnification is about 2 %. Some patients may detect this disparity by alternately covering each eye. Almost everyone can achieve binocular vision with one eye pseudophakia and other phakic (eye with crystalline lens). An IOL may be implanted at the time of cataract surgery or as secondary implantation at a later date. Advantages of IOL includes
- Minimal after- care of patients.
- Rapid return of binocular vision.
- Minimal aniseikonia (different image size seen by the eyes).
- Normal peripheral vision.","Pseudophakia patients are generally asymptomatic.

Patients with mono-focal IOL implants experience loss of accommodation and can see clearly at one distance only without correction.
Most lenses may cause positive (bright) or negative (dark) visual phenomenon (dysphotopsias) from internal reflections within the IOL that occur in certain lighting conditions.
Edge glare.
Induced ametropia (refractive error).
There may be monocular diplopia (double image) or polyopia (multiple images) or blurred vision if the IOL is decentered or tilted.","Pseudophakia is the condition being produced by implantation of an intraocular lens in the eye.
IOL:

Design: Currently available IOLs are either biconvex, plano- convex or meniscus. Majority of implanted lenses are biconvex. In addition to minimising the effects of tilt, decentration and spherical aberration, a convex posterior surface of a biconvex lens may reduce the migration of lens epithelial cells which produces opacification of the posterior capsule. Positive meniscus lens is rarely used because when it is tilted or decentered, the induced astigmatism and power change is dramatic. A 10˚- 15˚ tilt can induce enough regular and irregular astigmatism to make the spectacle correction intolerable.
Edge design: Reflections, flashes and shimmering peripheral lights are related to the edge design. Most lenses had rounded edges to avoid reflected images.
Optical transmission: After removal of crystalline lens, light with wavelengths of 300- 400 nm reaches to the retina. Ultraviolet light filtration is done in almost all IOLs to reduce blue light hazard to the eye.
Material: IOLs are mainly made up of PMMA, silicone or acrylic. Silicone and acrylic lenses are foldable so that they can be implanted through small incisions (2.2 to 3.5 mm in length). Higher the refractive index, flatter is the curvatures of lens. Due to flatter curvature, acrylic lens is the thinnest of all.
Special lenses: There are three special types of IOL viz. Multifocal, toric and aspheric.

- Multifocal IOLs produce an image that is about 30% reduced in contrast to mono-focal lenses.
- Toric IOL lenses are spherocylindrical glasses similar to spectacles. The magnitude of the cylinder in the IOL should be about 1.4 times the astigmatism in the cornea to neutralise corneal astigmatism completely.
- Aspheric IOL lenses are designed to minimise spherical aberration and to restore asphericity of eyes in young patients.

Calculation of IOL power: 
Prior to cataract surgery, the power of the IOL needed to give desired postoperative refraction is determined by measuring corneal curvature and axial length in a mathematical formula.
Corneal curvature is measured commonly by keratometry. Small variability of the keratometry reading gives an IOL power to within 0.5 D. Variability in the measurement of the axial length tends to be the main source of discrepancy in the calculation of IOL power.
When the cornea is irregular (due to corneal pathology or previous corneal or refractive procedures), a better prediction of the required IOL power may be obtained using corneal topography (photokeratoscopy or videokeratography) rather than keratometry to measure the corneal curvature. Corneal topography generates many more data points to be used in calculation of IOL power. Corneal topography may be used to assess the magnitude, location and regularity of pre- existing astigmatism. Incision in the peripheral part of steep axis produces a central flattening effect and reduces astigmatism. Change in corneal contour is less for the more peripheral incisions in the sclera or limbus.
IOL calculations that require axial length:
Theoretical formulas: These formulas for IOL power calculation has not changed since its original description by Fyoderov et al. in 1967. Several investigators have presented these formulas in different forms. Six variables used in the formula are

Net corneal power.
Axial length.
IOL power.
Effective lens position.
Desired refraction.
Vertex distance.

Several additional measurements of the eye are taken, but only seven preoperative variables (axial length, corneal power, horizontal corneal diameter, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, preoperative refraction, and age) were found to improve significantly the prediction of effective lens position. Third generation formulas Holladay 1, Hoffer Q and SRK/T and newer Holladay 2 are much more accurate than previous formulas. Older formulas such as SRK1, SRK2, and Binkhorst 1do not give desired result if the central corneal power is measured incorrectly.
Refractive lens exchange (RLE) for high myopia and hypermetropia with normal cornea and no previous keratorefractive surgery: 
Since there is loss of accommodation and the patients are relatively young, a small degree of myopia (minus 0.50 D) may be desirable so that dependence on spectacles may be reduced.
For myopia, third- generation theoretical formulas give excellent predictions if the axial length is stable and the measurements are accurate.
For hypermetrpia, the Holladay 2 formula is used. The use of this formula may reduce the prediction error in these cases to less than 1 D. Accurate measurements of axial length and corneal power are especially important in these cases.
Methods to determine axial length: Axial length may be determined by optical methods and ultrasonic methods. Ultrasonic measurement is less dependent on the density of the cataract.
Patients with previous keratorefractive surgery:
The number of patients who had keratorefractive surgery (radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy, or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis) is increasing steadily. These groups of patients present a difficult challenge. Instruments used to measure corneal power make incorrect assumptions for corneas that have irregular astigmatism. Due to this, the calculation method and the trial hard contact lens method are the most accurate, followed by corneal topography, automated keratometry, and manual keratometry.

Calculation method: For this, three parameters must be known viz. Net corneal power, refraction status before keratorefractive procedure, and the stabilised refraction after the keratorefractive procedure. This method usually is most accurate because the preoperative net corneal power values and refraction usually are accurate to ± 0.25 D.
Trial hard contact lens method: The trial hard contact lens method requires a plano hard contact lens with a known base curve and a patient whose cataract does not prevent refraction to about ± 0.50 D. The spheroequivalent refraction is calculated by normal refraction. The refraction is then repeated with hard contact lens. If the spheroequivalent refraction does not change with contact lens, then the power value for cornea of the patient must be same as that of the base curve of the plano contact lens in place.
Corneal topography: Corneal topography measure more than 5000 points over the entire cornea and more than 1000 points within the central 3 mm of cornea. This allows a very accurate determination of the anterior surface of the cornea. However, it does not provide any information about the posterior surface of the cornea. Most IOL calculations use a net index of refraction (1.3333) and the anterior radius of the cornea to calculate the net power of the cornea. Topography provides an excellent overview of central and peripheral corneal shape. Corneal topography does not provide accurate corneal power following keratorefractive surgery (radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy, or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis) with optical zones of 3 mm or less. In radial keratotomy with larger optical zones, the topography becomes more reliable. Calculation method and hard contact lens trial method are always more reliable.
Automated keratometry: Automated keratometers usually are more accurate than manual keratometers for corneas of small optical zone of about 3 mm for radial keratotomy. Automated keratometry measurements following photorefractive keratectomy or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis, yield better values of the front radius of the cornea. Like corneal topography, measurements are still not accurate.
Manual keratometry: Manual keratometers provide the least accurate measure of central corneal power following keratorefractive surgery, because the area that they measure usually is larger than 3.2 mm in diameter. Thus, measurements in this area are extremely unreliable for radial keratotomy corneas that have optical zones less than or equal to 4mm.The manual keratometer has similar problem with photorefractive keratectomy or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis as with topography or automated keratometers and, thus, is less accurate.


IOL calculations using net corneal power values and preoperative refraction: 
In a standard cataract surgery with IOL implantation, the preoperative refraction is not very helpful for calculation of the power of an implant, because as the crystalline lens is removed, so the diopteric power is being removed and then replaced. Cases in which power is not reduced in the eye (such as secondary implant in aphakia, piggy-back IOL in pseudophakia, or a minus IOL in the anterior chamber of a myopic phakic eye), the necessary IOL power for a desired postoperative refraction may be calculated from the corneal power and pre- operative refraction. Measurement of axial length is not necessary.
The formula used for calculation of IOL power uses following variables

Expected lens position in millimetres (distance from corneal vertex to principal plane of IOL).
IOL power in dioptres.
Net corneal power in dioptres.
Preoperative refraction in dioptres.
Desired postoperative refraction in dioptres.
Vertex distance in millimetres of refraction.

Secondary piggy-back IOL in pseudophakia: 
In patients who have significant residual refractive error following primary IOL implant, it is often easier surgically and more predictable optically, to leave the primary implant in place and calculate the secondary piggy-back IOL power to achieve the desired refraction. This method does not require knowledge of the power of the primary implant or of the axial length. This formula works for both plus or minus lenses.
Primary minus IOL in the anterior chamber of a myopic phakic eye:
The calculation for a minus IOL in the anterior chamber is the same as for the aphakic calculation of an anterior chamber lens, with the exception that the power of the lens is negative. In the past, these lenses were reserved for high myopia that could not be corrected by radial keratotomy or photorefractive keratectomy. Because successful laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis procedures have been performed in myopias up to minus 20 D, these lenses may be reserved for myopia that exceeds this power.

Optical refractive state in pseudophakia:
It depends upon the power of the Implanted IOL. Postoperatively, patient may have

Emmetropia: Emmetropia or normal refractive state is produced when the power of IOL matches with the refractive state of the eye. This is the most sought after ideal situation. Patients need correction only for reading or near vision.
Consecutive myopia: This is produced when the implanted IOL overcorrects the refraction of the eye. Such patients require correction with glasses for correction of myopia for distance vision and may or may not require glasses for reading or near vision, depending upon the degree of myopia.
Consecutive hypermetropia: This condition is produced when the IOL implanted has power less than the refractive state of the eye. Such patients require correction with convex glasses for distance and an additional plus correction for reading or near vision.
Astigmatism: Surgically induced astigmatism of varying degree may also be present in pseudophakia.","Diagnosis depends upon
History: It documents whether previous cataract surgery was performed, and whether were there any associated complications or not.
Examination of eyes: Eyes are examined for

Assessment of visual acuity.
Tonometry to measure intraocular pressure.
Corneal examination for any oedema.
Gonioscopy to assess angle of the anterior chamber.
Anterior chamber for cells, flare or presence of vitreous.
Iris for any iridectomy or iritis.
Position and stability of IOL.
Integrity and clarity of posterior capsule.
Ophthalmoscopy to rule out any cystoid macular oedema.


Signs:

Visible surgical wound in the cornea or sclera near the limbus.
Anterior chamber is of normal depth or only slightly deeper than normal.
Iridodonesis (tremulousness) of iris is usually not there.
There are four Purkinje images. Third and fourth Purkinje images from the IOL are very bright.
Pupil appears blackish in colour and shining reflexes are observed when light is flashed in pupillary area.
Presence of an IOL implant, which may be located in anterior chamber, iris plane, capsular bag or ciliary sulcus with or without suture fixation to the iris or sclera.
Peripheral iridectomy (may or may not be present).
Fundus examination on ophthalmoscopy shows normal size of the optic disc.
Visual acuity and refractive state varies, depending upon the power of implanted IOL.
Possible findings may include decentered IOL, iris capture of IOL, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), hyphaema, iridocyclitis, corneal oedema, vitreous in anterior chamber or cystoid macular oedema.","Usually no management is required in pseudophakia.
Pseudophakic patients may require correction of residual refractive power for distance, but only reading glasses may be needed.
Management of any complication as and when required.
Eliminating need for spectacles for both near and distance is an obtainable goal in many patients. Accommodative potential of either a pseudophakic or aphakic eye resulting in the combination of functional distance and near vision is described as pseudo- accommodation or apparent accommodation.
Intraocular lenses designed to improve accommodative amplitude are divided into

Accommodating lenses: These are designed to dynamically move in the antero- posterior visual axis in response to ciliary body contraction and relaxation.
Multifocal static lenses: These are designed to create multiple focal points for distance and near vision.


Prognosis:
Prognosis is usually good.
There may be increased risk of retinal detachment, especially in high myopes and if posterior capsule is not intact."
Pseudostrabismus,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/pseudostrabismus,"Pseudostrabismus gives an appearance of strabismus (squint) when no manifest deviation of the visual axis is actually present. This apparent misalignment of the eyes is created by certain morphological features of the face, although it may be associated with certain ocular or orbital conditions. The most common form of pseudostrabismus is pseudoesotropia where the eyes appear crossed. There may be pseudoexotropia, where eyes appear to be deviated outwards and pseudohypertropia where eyes appear to be misaligned vertically.
Patients with pseudostrabismus require full investigation as the prevalence of strabismus is higher in those diagnosed with pseudostrabismus as compared to general population and especially those with developmental delay.","Usually parents notice squint in the eyes of young child. The deviation is more noticeable when the child turns head and the eyes are in lateral gaze, especially in pseudoesotropia because nasal sclera appears buried in the epicanthal fold.
Parents may bring pictures of the baby with eyes in pseudoeso- or pseudoexodeviation.","I. Pseudoesotropia: Pseudoesotropia is the most common type of pseudostrabismus and may be seen due to

Morphological features: Morphological features such as orientation, shape and size of the orbits, shape and size of globes, and volume of retro-bulbar tissue may create an impression of misaligned eyes. Commonly this is seen in infants who have wide nasal bridge with prominent epicanthal folds (semi-lunar folds of skin near medial canthus).
Interpupillary distance (IPD): Patients with small interpupillary distance (IPD) may also appear to be esotropic.
Negative angle kappa: A negative angle kappa (angle formed between visual axis and pupillary axis at the pupil), where corneal light reflex appears to be on the temporal side of the center of pupil, may simulate esodeviation.
Enophthalmos: Enophthalmos gives the appearance of convergent deviation.

II. Pseudoexotropia: Pseudoexotropia may result due to

Morphological features: Morphological features of the face may result in false appearance of eyes to be divergent. Most commonly hypertelorism (widely set eyes) may result in pseudoexotropia.
Interpupillary distance (IPD): Patients with wide interpupillary distance (IPD) give the appearance of divergent deviation.
Positive angle kappa: Pathologic ectopia of the macula temporally due to traction of retina may produce a positive angle kappa. Positive angle kappa results in nasal displacement of the light reflex on the cornea simulating exotropia. Pseudoexotropia due to positive angle kappa is mostly seen in retinopathy of prematurity, which results in temporal dragging of the macula. It may also be seen in ectopic macula resulting from high myopia, toxocara retinal scars or congenital retinal folds.
Exophthalmos: Exophthalmos gives the appearance of divergent deviation.

III. Pseudohypertropia: Pseudohypertropia may be due to

Facial asymmetry: Facial asymmetry which produces an appearance of vertically misaligned eyes where one eye appears to be higher than the other.
Orbital tumours: Certain orbital tumours of the orbital floor may produce hypoglobus (downward displacement of eyeball) simulating vertical misalignment.
Trauma: Trauma to the orbital floor may also produce hypoglobus simulating vertical misalignment.

IV. Miscellaneous causes:

Ptosis may give appearance of vertical deviation.
Facial asymmetry.
Palpebral fissure asymmetry.
Dermatochalasis (lax eyelid skin and muscle).
Abnormal head posture.
Ill-fitting spectacles.
Heterochromia iridis (a difference in colour of iris of an eye).
Coloboma of iris (a fissure or gap in the iris).
Anisocoria (a difference in size of the pupils).



Risk factors:

Prematurity: Prematurity may cause retinopathy of prematurity which may result in temporal dragging of macula producing positive angle kappa and pseudoexotropia.
Facial morphology: Prominent epicanthal folds in asian children results in pseudoesotropia.
Orbital tumours: Certain orbital tumours may result in pseudohypertropia.
Orbital trauma: It may produce hypoglobus resulting in pseudohypertropia in some patients.
Chorioretinal infections: These may produce chorioretinal scarring with temporal dragging of macula resulting in pseudoexotropia.","Clinical diagnosis of pseudostrabismus requires ruling out the presence of true intermittent or constant strabismus.
Patients with pseudostrabismus require full investigation as the prevalence of strabismus is higher in those diagnosed with pseudostrabismus.
Diagnosis depends upon clinical history, physical examination and certain diagnostic tests.
Detailed history regarding weight at birth, gestational age, health of child, any procedure for retinopathy of prematurity may give diagnostic clues. History of initial presentation aided by photographs of the child may assist in documenting the onset, detecting the stability of the condition and confirming the diagnosis.
A good physical examination comprises of inspection of eye and adnexal morphology.
Both normal and pathologic variations in palpebral fissure may produce the appearance of strabismus, despite normal alignment of the visual axis of two eyes. Diagnosis of pseudoesotropia in infants with large epicanthal folds is probably the most common reason. Family members may believe that strabismus is present because they do not see much of white sclera on the nasal aspect of the eye compared to the temporal aspect. After careful examination, most parents may often be convinced that the position and shape of the eyelids and ocular adnexal structures may produce the appearance of strabismus. Doubting parents may be convinced by tightening the epicanthal fold by pinching the bridge of the nose.
Similarly, abnormalities involving the lateral canthal area may create impression of exotropia.

Diagnostic tests
I. Visual acuity evaluation: Every patient presenting with pseudostrabismus should have complete evaluation of visual acuity.
II. Motor evaluation: It comprises of tests such as

Hirschberg’s light reflex test: This gives a rough objective estimate of the angle of manifest strabismus and is especially useful when fixation in the deviating eye is poor.

- A pen-torch is shown in to the eyes from a distance of about one arm and the patient is asked to fixate the light. The corneal reflection of the light is more or less in the center of pupil of the fixating eye, but will be decentered in the squinting eye, in the direction opposite to that of deviation.
- The distance of the corneal light reflection, if any, is noted. In orthotropic eyes (eyes without squint), there is no decentering of the light reflex.


Cover-uncover test:

Cover test: This is done to detect heterotropia. It is good to begin the near test first by using light and then the accommodative target. Then the test is done for distance as follows
- The patient fixates a straight-ahead target.
- If a right deviation is suspected, the examiner covers the fixing left eye and notes any movement of the right eye to take up fixation.
- No movement indicates orthotropia or left heterotropia.
- Adduction of the right eye to take up fixation indicates right exotropia and abduction indicates right esotropia.
- Vertical movement indicates vertical hyper- or hypotropia.
- The test is repeated in the opposite eye.
Uncover test: It detects heterophoria. It is performed both for near and far.
Most examiners perform cover and uncover test sequentially, hence the term cover-uncover test.

Alternate cover test: It is a dissociation test which reveals the total deviation when fusion is suspended. It is performed after the cover-uncover test. The occluder is shifted quickly back and forth from one eye to other, several times. After the cover is removed, the speed and smoothness of recovery is noted as the eyes return to their pre- dissociated state. A patient with well compensated heterophoria will have straight eyes before and after the test has been performed, whereas a patient with poor control may decompensate to manifest deviation.
Ocular movements: It is necessary to test the function of each extra-ocular muscle by testing uniocular and binocular movements.

III. Sensory evaluation: Complete sensory evaluation may give clue to sensory development. Detection of fixation preference for one eye may be performed by vertical prism test.

Differential diagnosis
True strabismus should be ruled out by conducting thorough examination before reaching to the conclusion of pseudostrabismus.
Patient should be followed-up with re-evaluation every 6 months because true strabismus may sometimes develop in patients with pseudostrabismus.
Factors causing pseudostrabismus may be present when there is a true strabismus and may mask or accentuate its presence. Doubtful cases should be followed up. Certain findings are strong indicators that a child should be observed even though no convincing evidence of strabismus is found. These include
- Family history of strabismus or refractive error.
- Presence of significant heterophoria. Even a small esophoria when present is significant.
- A tendency to squeeze eye in sunlight indicates a possible intermittent childhood exotropia.
Once a pseudostrabismus is diagnosed, the parents should be explained the reason for the apparent deviation and reassured.","Orthoptic investigation establishes the presence of binocular single vision and fusion control in cases of pseudostrabismus.
For the common pseudoesotropia, since the nasal sclera part is being covered by the epicanthus, the orthotropic appearance may be demonstrated by pinching the nasal bridge slightly and revealing the nasal sclera. As the flat nasal bridge develops, this excessive epicanthal skin is raised and the condition corrects by itself. Hence, no treatment is required except for follow-up for disappearance of pseudoesotropia.
However, true manifest squint is treated if it is associated with pseudostrabismus.

Prognosis
The natural course of pseudostrabismus is variable. Most of the cases of pseudoesotropia resolve usually by the age of two to three years, because the epicanthal folds diminish as the bridge of the nose enlarges.
Pseudostrabismus secondary to positive or negative angle kappa typically persists in adulthood."
Puerperal sepsis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/puerperal-sepsis,"Puerperal sepsis
Puerperal sepsis is an infective condition in the mother following childbirth. It is the third most common cause of maternal death worldwide as a result of child birth after haemorrhage and abortion. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates puerperal sepsis accounts for 15% of the 500000 maternal deaths annually. In low and middle income countries puerperal infections are the sixth leading cause of disease burden in women during their reproductive years. Puerperal sepsis can cause long-term health problems such as chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility in females.
Puerperal sepsis was defined as infection of the genital tract occurring at any time between the onset of rupture of membranes or labour, and the 42nd day postpartum in which two or more of the following are present:

Fever (oral temperature 38.5°C/101.3°F or higher on any occasion).
Pelvic pain.
Abnormal vaginal discharge, e.g. presence of pus.
Abnormal smell/foul odour of discharge.
Delay in the rate of reduction of the size of the uterus (involution).

(A puerperal infection is a more general term than puerperal sepsis and includes not only infections due to puerperal sepsis, but also all extra-genital infections and incidental infections-WHO).
Sample Registration System (SRS), India estimated that 16% and 11% maternal deaths in the year 1998 (survey of causes of death) and 2001-03(special survey of deaths) respectively were due to puerperal sepsis. In a population based study in rural Maharashtra puerperal sepsis was the second major cause of maternal mortality (13.2%) after postpartum haemorrhage.
( Maternal mortality-The death of a woman while pregnant, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not from accidental or incidental causes).
Puerperal sepsis is preventable with provision of adequate antenatal care, referral and timely treatment of complications of pregnancy, promoting institutional delivery and postnatal care.","Puerperal sepsis was defined as infection of the genital tract occurring at any time between the onset of rupture of membranes or labour, and the 42nd day postpartum in which two or more of the following symptoms and signs may be present-

fever (temperature of 38°C or more) with chills and general malaise,
lower abdominal pain,
tenderness lower abdomen,
Delay in the rate of reduction of the size of the uterus (involution)(&lt;2cm/day during first eight days)
Purulent foul-smelling lochia,
light vaginal bleeding, shock","Puerperal sepsis is bacterial infection of the genital tract which occurs after the birth of a baby. Some of the most common bacteria causing puerperal sepsis are streptococci, staphylococci, escherichia coli (E.coli), clostridium tetani, clostridium welchii, chlamydia and gonococci (bacteria which cause sexually transmitted diseases). More than one type of bacteria may be involved in puerperal sepsis. Bacteria may be either nosocomial, endogenous or exogenous.
Nosocomial infections are acquired in hospitals or other health facilities and may come from the hospital environment or from the patient's own flora.
Endogenous bacteria- These bacteria are normally present in the vagina and rectum without causing any disease (e.g. some types of streptococci and staphylococci, E.coli, clostridium welchii). Endogenous bacteria can be transmitted from vagina to uterus;

during pelvic examinations and use of instruments,
following obstructed labour due to tissue damage and,
prolonged ruptured of membrane because microorganisms can enter the uterus.

Exogenous bacteria-These bacteria are introduced into the vagina from the outside by unclean hands and unsterile instruments, sexually transmitted infections, foreign substances inserted in to vagina. Tetanus bacilli were particularly prevalent in rural areas. India has eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus by routine immunization coverage and promotion of institutional/clean delivery/clean cord practices and effective surveillance system.
Risk factors-Some women are more vulnerable to puerperal sepsis, including-

Prolonged/obstructed labour,
multiple vaginal examinations in labour (more than five),
premature ruptured membranes,
caesarean section (CS),
obstetrical manoeuvres,
post-partum haemorrhage,
pre-existing sexually transmitted infections,
unrepaired cervical lacerations, or large vaginal lacerations,
unhygienic practices during labour,
prolonged retention of dead fetus, retained fragments of placenta or membranes,
obesity,
low socio-economic status,
poor nutrition,
primiparity,
anaemia, diabetes.

Community factors-

Delivery by an untrained birth attendant,
lack of transportation,
long distance from a woman’s house to the health facility,
cultural factors which may delay care-seeking behaviour,
low status of women which contributes to their poor health in general,
lack of knowledge of symptoms and sings of puerperal sepsis, and
availability of postnatal care.","General history and clinical examination of women after child birth are important steps in assessing the post partum complications. Vital signs such as temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure, and examination of breast, abdomen, perineum, legs; lochia (discharge after child birth) should be examined carefully.
Various diseases causing fever in puerperium (six weeks period after childbirth) should be excluded; such as-

Urinary tract infection (acute pyelonephritis),
wound infection (e.g. scar of caesarean section),
mastitis or breast abscess,
thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis,
respiratory tract infections,
other medical conditions, such as malaria, typhoid fever, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV)

Laboratory investigation- 

Complete blood count,
Urinalysis, with culture and sensitivity tests,
Electrolytes estimation,
Cervical or uterine cultures,
Blood culture, if sepsis is suspected,
Coagulation studies-In pelvic thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or invasive treatment (eg, surgical procedure) is being considered,
Pelvic ultrasonography may be helpful in detecting retained products of conception, pelvic abscess, or infected hematoma,
Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI are useful in establishing the diagnosis of septic pelvic thrombosis","The objective of management in puerperal sepsis is to make an early diagnosis, treat, prevent complications, and consequently to improve quality of life.
Isolation and barrier nursing care-Basic principle of care in puerperal sepsis cases is preventing the spread of infection to other women and their babies by providing isolation and barrier nursing care.
Administration of antibiotics- A combination of antibiotics is given until the woman is fever-free for 48 hours. If fever is still present 72 hours after starting the antibiotic regime, the doctor will re-evaluate the woman and her treatment. Referral to a higher level health facility may be necessary.
Tetanus toxoid- If there is uncertainty about tetanus vaccination, it should be given.
Plenty of fluids- Fluids are given to correct or prevent dehydration and help to lower the fever. In severe cases, it is necessary to give intravenous fluids at first. If the woman is conscious and no operative procedure is required in the next few hours, she may also be given oral fluids.
Ruling out retained placental fragments- Retained placental fragments can be a cause of puerperal sepsis. Digital exploration of the uterus to remove clots and large pieces of placental tissue will be required if retained placental pieces are suspected.
Care of the newborn- Unless the mother is very ill, the newborn can safely stay with her. However, precautions are necessary to prevent the infection passing from the mother to the newborn. Careful observation of the newborn is essential to recognize early signs of infection."
Postpartum haemorrhage,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/postpartum-haemorrhage,"Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a complication of delivery and the most common cause of maternal death, accounting for about 35% of all maternal deaths worldwide. These deaths have a major impact on the lives and health of the families affected.
PPH is commonly defined as a blood loss of 500 ml or more within 24 hours after birth, while severe PPH is defined as a blood loss of 1000 ml or more within the same timeframe according to World Health Organisation (WHO). A small blood loss that makes the woman haemodynamically unstable is also termed as PPH.
PPH is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with in the first 24 hours following delivery and this is regarded as primary PPH; whereas any excessive bleeding from the birth canal occurring between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally (after delivery) is termed as secondary PPH.
In practice, blood loss after delivery is seldom measured and it is not clear whether measuring blood loss improves the care and outcome for the women. In addition, some women may require interventions to manage PPH with less blood loss than others if they are anaemic.
PPH may result from failure of the uterus to contract adequately (atony), genital tract trauma (vaginal or cervical lacerations), uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, or maternal bleeding disorders. Uterine atony is the most common cause and consequently the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide.
The maternal mortality ratio in developing countries in 2015 is 239 per 100000 live births versus 12 per 100000 live births in developed countries. Thus 99% of all maternal deaths occur in developing countries with more than half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and almost one third occur in South Asia. Very small proportion, 1% of maternal deaths occur in the developed world. There are large disparities between countries, but also within countries; maternal deaths are more in low income group and rural areas as compare to high income group and urban areas.
About 830 women die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications around the world every day. 52% of maternal deaths are attributable to three leading preventable causes-haemorrhage, sepsis, and hypertensive disorders. WHO statistics suggest that 25% of maternal deaths are due to PPH. Postpartum bleeding is the quickest of maternal killers; can kill even a healthy woman within two hours, if not treated.
Incidence of PPH is reported as 2% - 4% after vaginal delivery and 6% after cesarean section; with uterine atony being the cause in about 50% cases. Every year about 14 million women around the world suffer from PPH.
In India sample registration scheme (SRS), during survey of causes of death 1998, reported that PPH was a major cause of maternal mortality and responsible for 30 % of maternal deaths and according to SRS 2001-2003, PPH accounts 38 percent of maternal deaths. Estimates of maternal mortality ratio in India done by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in 2003 also showed PPH as a leading cause of maternal mortality in study population. 
A combination of quality antenatal care, skilled care at birth by active management of third stage of labour, the availability of high quality emergency obstetric care (with trained medical personnel and adequate infrastructure) and improved access to these services are essential to save many maternal lives.","The usual presentation of PPH is one of heavy vaginal bleeding that can quickly lead to signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock.

Blood loss is usually visible at the introitus, and this is especially seen when the placenta has delivered. If the placenta remains inside the uterus, then a significant amount of blood can be retained in the uterus behind a partially separated placenta, the membranes, or both.

Even after placental delivery, blood may collect in an atonic uterus. For this reason, the uterine size and tone should be monitored throughout the delivery and following delivery of the placenta. This is done by gently palpating the uterine fundus.

If the cause of bleeding is not uterine atony, then blood loss may be slower and clinical signs and symptoms of hypovolemia may develop over a longer time period. Bleeding from trauma may be concealed in the form of hematomas of the retroperitoneum, broad ligament or lower genital tract, or abdominal cavity.

Signs of hypovolemic shock resulting from blood loss-

Fall in blood pressure (BP), (BP may be normal initially)
Palpitations, tachycardia, dizziness
Weakness, sweating
Restlessness, pallor,
Oliguria (reduced urine volume)","Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) may result from various reasons such as failure of the uterus to contract adequately (atony), genital tract trauma (vaginal or cervical lacerations), uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, or maternal bleeding disorders.
Causes of primary PPH-
a) Uterine atony is failure of the uterus to contract following delivery. It is the most common cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Atonic bleeding occurs from the placental site when the uterus (myometrial muscles) does not contract and retract properly and thus the blood vessels are not compressed and bleeding is not controlled.

Any condition that interferes with uterine contraction, such as a retained placenta, remnants of placental tissue, membranes and blood clot will predispose to atonic bleeding. Full bladder, antepartum haemorrhage due to placenta praevia (low lying attachment of placenta) or placental abruption (separation of placenta from uterus prior to delivery) may also cause PPH.
Overstretched uterus as seen in high parity, multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios (Increased amount of amniotic fluid), large baby, fibroids may be the risk factors for atonic PPH.
Poor myometrial contraction can result from fatigue due to prolonged labor or rapid forceful labor, especially if stimulated. It can also result from the inhibition of contractions by drugs (such as halogenated anesthetic agents, nitrates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnesium sulfate, beta-sympathomimetics, and nifedipine). Anaemia is also a risk factor for PPH.
Intrauterine death with fetus retained in uterus for three to four weeks, severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia may also lead to PPH.

b) Genital trauma: Damage to the genital tract may occur spontaneously or through manipulations used to deliver the baby. Injuries during labour to perineum, vaginal walls, cervix, uterus, episiotomy, caesarean section can also cause PPH. Trauma may occur following very prolonged or vigorous labor, especially if the patient has relative or absolute cephalopelvic disproportion and the uterus has been stimulated with medicines (oxytocin or prostaglandins). Cervical laceration is most commonly associated with forceps delivery. Trauma also may occur following extrauterine or intrauterine manipulation of the fetus.
Uterine rupture is most common in patients with previous cesarean delivery scars.Any uterus that has undergone a procedure resulting in a total or thick or partial disruption of the uterine wall should be considered at risk for rupture in a future pregnancy.
c) Tissue: Uterine contraction and retraction leads to detachment and expulsion of the placenta. Complete detachment and expulsion of the placenta permits continued retraction and optimal occlusion of blood vessels.
Retention of a portion of the placenta and membranes, failure of complete separation of the placenta (placenta accrete) and its variants, placenta previa may cause PPH. The placenta is more likely to be retained at extreme preterm gestations (especially &lt; 24 week) and significant bleeding can occur.
d)Coagulation problems: Women with pre-existing bleeding disorders and women taking therapeutic anticoagulants are at increased risk of PPH. Abnormalities related to bleeding disorder (clotting system) may be preexistent or acquired; such as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) may be related to preexisting disease called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or acquired secondary to HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count)- a complication of preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and sepsis.
An underlying bleeding disorder should be considered in a woman with any of the following: menorrhagia since menarche, family history of bleeding disorders, personal history of notable bruising without known injury, bleeding from the oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract without obvious lesion, or epistaxis (nosebleed) of longer than 10 minutes duration (possibly requiring packing or cautery).
Most cases of PPH have no identifiable risk factors. PPH usually has a single cause, but more than one cause is also possible.
Secondary PPH is the abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally. It is often associated with infection (endometritis).
Factors that prevent women from receiving or seeking care during pregnancy and child birth-

Poverty
Distance
Lack of information
Inadequate services
Cultural practices

These are the barriers that limit access to quality maternal health services; must be identified and addressed at all levels of the health system to improve maternal health.","Diagnosis of PPH is usually performed by closely observing the pregnant women during child birth and afterwards. After childbirth, blood loss and other clinical parameters should be closely monitored. When estimating the percentage of blood loss, consideration should be given to body weight and the original haemoglobin level (PPH may be aggravated by pre-existing anaemia).

Blood volume depends on the body weight. Approximate blood volume (in litres) equals body weight in kilograms divided by 12.
Visually estimating the amount of blood loss may lead to underestimation. There is not enough evidence though to recommend the measurement of blood loss over clinical estimation.
Blood collection drapes for vaginal deliveries and weighing swabs are more accurate than visual blood loss estimation.
Participating in clinical reconstructions may encourage early diagnosis and prompt treatment of postpartum haemorrhage.
Written and pictorial guidelines may help staff working in labour wards to estimate blood loss.

Rapid recognition and diagnosis of PPH is essential to successful management. Resuscitative measures and treatment of the underlying cause must start quickly before sequelae of severe hypovolemia develop.
Investigations-

Complete blood count for diagnosis of anaemia during antenatal period and labour.
Blood typing and antibody screening testsduring antenatal period. 
Cross matching of blood for a patient at high risk of PPH such as previous severe PPH, placenta previa, possible placenta accreta, multiple previous cesarean deliveries, known coagulation disorders, or severe thrombocytopenia. (Notifying the blood bank of the possible need for additional blood products in short order).
Coagulation studies.
Antenatal ultrasound for detecting high-risk patients with predisposing factors for PPH,
All women who have had a caesarean section previously must have their placental site determined by ultrasound near term.

Clinical examination during third stage of labour - 

Assessment of uterine tone and size
Inspection of placenta if delivered
Manual exploration of uterus for placenta and membranes
Palpation and inspection for hematomas
Inspection of cervix and vagina for any injury
Additional investigations for diagnosis of secondary PPH include:

High and low vaginal swabs
Blood cultures if pyrexia (fever)
Full blood count
C-reactive protein
Pelvic ultrasound that might help to exclude the presence of retained products of conception","As the majority of women who experience PPH complications have no identifiable clinical risk factors, it is recommended that active management of the third stage of labour (AMTSL) be offered to all women during childbirth, whenever a skilled provider is assisting with the delivery.
The three components of the active management of third stage of labour (AMTSL):
1. Oxytocic drugs should be offered routinely in the management of the third stage of labour in all women. Prophylactic oxytocic drugs have been found to reduce the risk of PPH by about 60%. If oxytocin is not available, oral misoprostol should be given. Misoprostol can be given by community health worker (ASHA) who may be present in the community during home delivery cases*.
If bleeding is not controlled after use of oxytocin, it is recommended to switch over to the next uterotonic ergot derivatives (methergine) or sublingual misoprostol. (Ergot derivatives (methergine) are contradindicated in hypertensive disorders for the prevention of PPH).
2. Late cord clamping (performed approximately 1 to 3 minutes after birth) is recommended for all births while initiating simultaneously essential new-born care.
3. Controlled cord traction is the recommended method for the removal of the placenta. Uterine massage following the delivery of the placenta is included in AMTSL, where skilled birth attendants are available.
Management of Postpartum haemorrhage-
Initial assessment is performed and basic treatment should be instituted as follows:

Call for help
Assess airway, breathing, circulation (ABC)
Provide supplementary oxygen
Obtain intravenous line
Start fluid replacement with intravenous crystalloid fluid
Monitor blood pressure, pulse and respiration
Catheterize bladder and monitor urinary output
Assess need for blood transfusion
Start intravenous oxytocin infusion
Order laboratory tests-complete blood count, coagulation screen, blood grouping and cross-match

Observe factors related to bleeding and determine cause,
(a) If uterine atony is suspected:

Uterine massage; ((Uterine packing is not recommended for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal delivery);
bimanual uterine compression;
external aortic compression; and
balloon or condom tamponade.

If the woman is not responding to the treatment or a treatment cannot be administered at the facility, she should be transferred to a higher-level facility with on-going intravenous uterotonic infusion, legs elevated to improve blood supply to vital organs and keep the woman worm. Accompanying attendant should rub the woman’s abdomen continuously and, if necessary, apply mechanical compression.
If mechanical and pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage, surgical measures are instituted:

Compression sutures
Bilateral ligation of uterine arteries
Bilateral ligation of internal iliac (hypogastric) arteries
Hysterectomy

(b) If Placenta delivered incomplete

Oxytocin
Manual exploration to remove fragments
Gentle curettage or aspiration
If bleeding continues, manage as uterine atony.

(c) If placenta is not delivered:

Additional oxytocin in combination with controlled cord traction

If whole placenta still retained

Manual removal with prophylactic antibiotics

(d) PPH due to lower genital tract trauma: excessive bleeding or shock with contracted uterus-

Look for lower genital tract trauma with repair of tears; and evacuation and repair of haematoma.
If bleeding continues administer tranexamic acid.

(e) Uterine rupture or dehiscence: excessive bleeding or shock-

Treat for uterine rupture or dehiscence with laparotomy for primary repair of uterus and Hysterectomy if repair fails.
If bleeding continues administer tranexamic acid.

(f) Uterine inversion: uterine fundus not felt abdominally or visible in vagina-
Treat for uterine inversion:

Immediate manual replacement
Hydrostatic correction
Manual reverse inversion (use general anaesthesia or wait for effect of any uterotonic to wear off)
If treatment is not successful, laparotomy is advised to correct inversion.
If laparotomy correction is not successful then hysterectomy is performed.

(g) Clotting disorder: bleeding in the absence of above conditions, Treat for clotting disorder as necessary with blood products.
Secondary PPH is the abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally. It is often associated with infection (endometritis) and conventional treatment involves antibiotics and uterotonics.
Surgical measures should be undertaken if there is excessive or continuing bleeding, irrespective of ultrasound findings."
Photophthalmia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/photophthalmia,"Photophthalmia is produced due to exposure to short wavelength ultraviolet (UV) rays (especially in wavelength range of 311- 290 nanometer). The cornea absorbs ultraviolet radiation. This may be associated with

Exposure of naked eye to arc light: This may be seen in cases exposed to industrial welding. It is also seen in cinema operators.
Snow blindness: It is produced by reflected ultraviolet rays from snow surface.
Short circuiting: This is due to exposure to bright light being produced on short circuiting.

The essential change is the desquamation of corneal epithelium resulting in multiple erosions.","Symptoms of photophthalmia usually manifest with a latent period of about 4- 5 hours after exposure to ultraviolet rays. It includes

Extreme burning pain.
Intense foreign body sensation.
Lacrimation or watering.
Redness.
Marked photophobia (aversion to light).
Blepharospasm (abnormal contraction of eyelid muscles).
Swelling of palpebral conjunctiva.

The symptoms disappear in about 1- 2 days following healing of corneal desquamation.","Photophthalmia may be caused due to exposure to short wavelength

Exposure of naked eye to exposed arc light: This may be seen in cases exposed to industrial welding. It is also seen in cinema studios. It is rarely due to exposure to enclosed arc light since the glass globe absorbs the most deleterious light rays.
Snow blindness: It is produced by reflected ultraviolet rays from snow surface. In snow blindness, the cause is similar, since the ultraviolet rays are reflected from snow surfaces. Snow reflects 85% of ultraviolet radiations, increasing the radiation exposure of cornea. The higher the altitude, more ultraviolet radiation is absorbed because the radiation traverses the thin air easily.
Short circuiting: This is due to exposure to bright light being produced on short circuiting.

The essential pathology is the desquamation of corneal epithelium resulting in multiple erosions.","Diagnosis depends upon the clinical history and signs observed on examination.
The symptoms in eye appear characteristically after a latent period of 4- 5 hours of exposure to ultra-violet light. There is intense burning pain, foreign body sensation, and watering of eyes. There is associated marked photophobia and blepharospasm.
On slit-lamp examination, corneal epithelium shows breach in continuity of epithelium which takes up fluorescein sodium stain. In severe cases, the epithelium of the cornea is detached, which may result in corneal erosion. There is conjunctival erythema (redness). There may be presence of retro-tarsal folds.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
General prophylactic therapy:
Prophylactic therapy consists of wearing dark glasses when exposure is anticipated. Material such as Crookes glass may be used, since it cuts off nearly all the ultraviolet and infrared rays.

Medical therapy:
It comprises of

Cold compresses.
Lubricant eye drops.
Bandaging both eyes for 24 hours after putting antibiotic eye ointment and cycloplegic (which puts ciliary muscle to rest) eye drops may provide relief from the severe pain. It also allows epithelium to regenerate/grow over the eroded areas.

Local surface topical anaesthesia to the eye should be avoided."
Post-herpetic neuralgia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/post-herpetic-neuralgia,"Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is defined as a chronic neuropathic pain that persists for three or more months following acute Herpes zoster (shingles) infection. It is a severe painful secondary phase, which may develop three to six months after the resolution of initial phase of Herpes zoster (HZ) infection. Pain has a dermatomal distribution and is confined to same dermatome as the rash. Herpes zoster infection results from activation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) which remains latent in dorsal root ganglia since the first infection of chickenpox (varicella). Pain frequently precedes Herpes zoster infection (pre-herpetic neuralgia), and outlasts the herpetic rash by some weeks. It is more common in older individuals (develops in up to 75% of patients over 70 years of age) and is less common in individuals younger than fifty years of age.
Post-herpetic neuralgia subsides eventually on its own. However, it may make patients suffer for years and may leave a band of anaesthetic skin. It may lead to muscle weakness as well, if it affects major motor nerve.
Post-herpetic neuralgia is associated with persistent and, very often, refractory neuropathic pain. The neuralgia is excruciating with superimposed lancinating paresthesias. Pain may be constant or intermittent, aggravated by minor stimulus (allodynia) such as heat or touch, and is worse at night. The agony of pain leads to insomnia, anorexia, and changes in mood (severe depression).
Post-herpetic neuralgia may produce multiple types of pain in patient e.g.

Constant aching, deep, or burning pain
Paroxysmal lancinating pain
Hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain)
Allodynia (pain associated with non-painful stimuli)


Post-herpetic neuralgia is a psychosocial condition with a significant impact on the psychological, social, and physical functioning of an individual.","The crusts of Herpes zoster falls away on healing, and leave pink scars in the distribution of rashes. The scars gradually become hypo-pigmented and atrophic.
Symptoms of PHN are

Pain: Post-herpetic neuralgia may produce multiple types of pain in patients such as

1. Constant aching, deep, or burning pain
2. Paroxysmal lancinating pain
3. Hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain)
4. Allodynia (pain associated with non-painful stimuli)

Sensory abnormalities in scarred skin: These may take the form of

1. Hypo-aesthesia: There is hypo-aesthesia or decreased sensations in the scarred region in patients with PHN. Greater the degree of hypo-aesthesia, longer is the time nerve block treatment needs to be given.
2. Allodynia and hyperaesthesia: Allodynia and hyper-aesthesia, are frequently noted in the scarred skin.
Chronic PHN is commonly shows psychiatric co-morbidity such as low mood and tendency to social isolation.
In most of the patients, pain and sensory abnormalities resolve as the skin lesions heal over time. In some, pain may persist in spite of healing.","Risk factors for developing PHN are

Old age
Severity of acute pain of HZ
Greater rash severity
Painful prodrome preceding acute symptoms
Sensory dysfunction in dermatome during HZ
Trigeminal distribution of infection
Fever
Psychosocial stress

PHN is a painful condition, which develops following acute Herpes zoster infection. Pain frequently precedes Herpes zoster (pre-herpetic neuralgia) and usually outlasts the rash of HZ by some weeks.
Acute Herpes zoster infection or shingles results from activation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, which is latent in the dorsal root ganglia since the initial infection (varicella). The virus replicates in the ganglionic neurones, and infects other neighbouring cells and then transmitted down the axon of nerve to infect the skin where it results in blister formation. To a limited extent, virus also travels centrally and causes inflammation of the meninges and spinal cord.","The diagnosis of PHN is by clinical examination in most of the patients.
AHZ is characterised by acute pain lasting for about two to four weeks and it precedes rash by about seven to ten days. The typical rash present as red maculopapular eruption that changes into vesicles, pustules, and finally crust formation. Normally the symptoms of AHZ resolves within two to four weeks, and only about ten percent of patients develop PHN. PHN is the frequent chronic complication of HZ and the most common neuropathic pain resulting from infection.
Testing is, generally done to identify coexisting treatable diseases such as vertebral compression or any underlying disease responsible for immunocompromised state of patient. Immunocompromised state predisposes to the infection with Herpes zoster infection.

Differential diagnosis:

Thoracic radiculopathy in cases with thoracic PHN
Peripheral neuropathy
Intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pathology may mimic pain of PHN affecting thoracic dermatome.
Intracranial pathology, diseases of Eye, and diseases of Ear, Nose and throat may mimic PHN in the distribution of trigeminal nerve.","Management
PHN is an exceptionally complex drug resistant neuropathic pain. It results from changes in central and peripheral nervous system somatosensory processing.
Aim is to treat patient with Post-herpetic neuralgia within first 72 hours of the rash, in order to reduce both acute neuralgia (AN) and PHN.
PHN is one of the most difficult pain syndromes to treat. The reason why PHN occurs in some patients and not in others, is not known. The condition occurs more frequently in older patients, and also following acute Herpes zoster infection of the trigeminal cranial nerve, as compared to acute Herpes zoster involving thoracic region. It is said that aggressive treatment of acute Herpes zoster infection helps in avoiding PHN.

Preventive vaccination: 
A live attenuated vaccine to boost immunity to VZV and reducing the risk of HZ, is recommended for adults older than 60 years of age. It significantly reduces both HZ and PHN.

Medical therapy:

Antiviral drugs: Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir may reduce both acute neuralgia (AN) and PHN. These drugs reduce viral shedding and help in resolution of symptoms.
Anticonvulsant gabapentin: Gabapentin is effective in management of PHN. The mechanism of action of gabapentin is unknown.
Anticonvulsant Pregabalin: Pregabalin reduces release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Treatment with pregabalin results in significant improvement, as is seen in controlled study.
Tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs): Tricyclic anti-depressants block certain receptors and inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and thus block the painful stimulus. Examples are amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine and imipramine. Serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine and duloxetine have given promising results in the treatment of PHN. Recent studies have shown that venlafaxine may be of some benefit in patients who cannot tolerate other anti-depressants. Due to incomplete efficacy and side effects of monotherapy, many trials have been conducted to have a combined drug therapy. For example, combination of nortriptyline and gabapentin have been tried.
Opioids: Opioids such as morphine and tramadol are shown to relieve pain of PHN. Earlier evidence favoured TCAs but latest controlled trials support opioids over TCAs.


Topical therapy:
Due to the associated side effects of systemic therapy, the focus has shifted to topical therapy. It is a convenient and pain-free self-administration by the patient. There is reduced frequency of administration, reduced systemic exposure due to limited absorption from the skin surface, and enhancement of patient compliance.
Local topical therapy includes

Lidocaine: 5% Lidocaine patch is a safe and efficient option of local therapy in case of localised neuropathic pain (LNP). Lidocaine patch is a targeted peripheral analgesic. It has high safety, efficacy, and tolerability and is a chosen treatment in case of local neuropathic pain.
Capsaicin: 8% Capsaicin patch may be used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain either alone or in combination of other medicines. However, capsaicin may cause transient adverse effects such as erythema and pain.
Topical and intranasal analgesic pharmacotherapy: Topical and intranasal analgesic pharmacotherapy may be used in place of systemic therapy. Intranasal 10% ketamine may be combined with topical 6% gabapentin, 10% ketoprofen, 5% lidocaine, or 10% ketamine cream.
Gabapentin: 6% Gabapentin gel patches have been tried. It is a recent advance in the treatment of PHN. Topical gabapentin provided rapid improvement of symptoms.
Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS): Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation is a recent advance in the management of PHN. Patients refractory to medical therapy may be treated with TENS. Patients with TENS report a significant decrease in pain. It is seen that whether use of TENS or antivirals, either alone or in combination, cannot completely prevent PHN. However, TENS is found to be most successful in reducing the incidence of subacute herpetic neuralgia.
Ultrasound-guided musculocutaneous peripheral nerve block: A patient with excruciating pain and not responding to any treatment was selected. Ultrasound-guided musculocutaneous peripheral nerve block helped in control of symptoms due to PHN.


Surgical therapy:
Surgical approaches such as stereotaxic trigeminal tractotomy and dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) treatment procedures have been described in the treatment of PHN."
Postpartum depression/ Perinatal depression,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/psychiatry-psychology/postpartum-depression-perinatal-depression,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is depression that occurs to a mother after a childbirth. PPD is defined as an episode of non-psychotic depression with onset within 1 year of childbirth. PPD can happen any time after childbirth. It often starts within 1 to 3 weeks after a childbirth and may last for weeks or months at a time.
The word ""postpartum"" means ""after birth,"" so ""postpartum depression"" is talking only about depression after the baby is born. For many women, this term is correct: they start feeling depression sometime within the first year after they have the baby. But some women start to feel depression while they're still pregnant and the term ""perinatal depression"" is used to describe this situation. The word ""perinatal"" describes the time during pregnancy or just after birth.Researchers believe that depression is one of the most common problems women experience during and after pregnancy. Perinatal depression affects as many as one in seven women.
This type of depression does not only affect mothers. Sometimes new fathers alsoexperience postpartum or prenatal depression.
Feelings of postpartum depression are more intense and last longer than those of “baby blues”. It is a term used to describe the worry, sadness, and tiredness many women experience after having a baby. “Baby blues” symptoms typically resolve on their own within a few days.
Mothers with postpartum depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that may make it difficult for them to complete daily care activities for themselves or for others.
Postpartum depression is a common complication of childbearing and as such represents a considerable public health problem affecting women and their families and make it an important medical condition to diagnose, treat and prevent.","The patterns of symptoms in women with postpartum depression are similar to those in women who have depression unrelated to childbirth, apart from the fact that the content may focus on the delivery or baby.
Some of the more common symptoms a woman may experience include:

Feeling sad, hopeless, empty, or overwhelmed
Crying more often than usual or for no apparent reason
Worrying or feeling overly anxious
Feeling moody, irritable, or restless
Oversleeping, or being unable to sleep even when her baby is asleep
Having trouble concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions
Experiencing anger or rage
Losing interest in activities that are usually enjoyable
Suffering from physical aches and pains, including frequent headaches, stomach problems, and muscle pain
Eating too little or too much
Withdrawing from or avoiding friends and family
Having trouble bonding or forming an emotional attachment with her baby
Persistently doubting her ability to care for her baby
Thinking about harming herself or her baby.

Postpartum depression is different from the baby blues-

The “baby blues” is a term used to describe the feelings of worry, unhappiness, and fatigue that many women experience after having a baby. Babies require a lot of care, so it’s normal for mothers to be worried about, or tired from, providing that care. Baby blues, which affects up to 80 percent of mothers, includes feelings that are somewhat mild, last a week or two, and go away on their own.
With postpartum depression, feelings of sadness and anxiety can be extreme and might interfere with a woman’s ability to care for herself or her family. Because of the severity of the symptoms, postpartum depression usually requires treatment. The condition may begin shortly before or any time after childbirth, but commonly begins between a week and a month after delivery.","Postpartum depression probably is caused by a combination of factors. These factors include the following:

Changes in hormone levels just after childbirth: levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease just after child birth and these changes may trigger depression in the same way as smaller changes in hormone levels before menstrual periods trigger mood swings and tension.

History of depression: Women who have had depression at any time-before, during, or after pregnancy, or who currently are being treated for depression have an increased risk of developing postpartum depression.

Emotional factors: If the pregnancy is not planned or is not wanted, this can affect the way a woman feels about her pregnancy and her unborn baby. Even when a pregnancy is planned, it can take a long time to adjust for having a new baby. Parents of babies who are sick or who need to stay in the hospital may feel sad, angry, or guilty. These emotions can affect a woman’s self-esteem and how she deals with stress.

Fatigue: Many women feel very tired after giving birth. It can take weeks for a woman to regain her normal strength and energy. For women who have had their babies by cesarean section, it may take a longer time.

Lifestyle factors: Lack of support from family members and stressful life events, such as a recent death of a loved one, a family illness, or moving to a new city, can greatly increase the risk of postpartum depression.

Other risk factors may be-

Family history of depression
A difficult pregnancy or birth experience
Giving birth to twins or other multiples
Experiencing problems in your relationship with your partner
Experiencing financial problems
Being a teen mother
Preterm (before 37 weeks) labor and delivery.
Pregnancy with birth complications.
Smoking, drinking alcohol, and use of harmful drugs
Negative thoughts and feelings about being a mother, these include

Having doubts that you can be a good mother
Putting pressure on yourself to be a perfect mother
Feeling that you’re no longer the person you were before you had your baby
Feeling that you’re less attractive after having your baby
Having no free time for yourself
Feeling tired and moody because you aren’t sleeping well or getting enough sleep","A health care provider can diagnose a woman with postpartum depression. Because symptoms of this condition are broad and may vary between women, a health care provider can help a woman figure out whether the symptoms she is feeling are due to postpartum depression or something else. A woman who experiences any of these symptoms should see a health care provider right away.
Your doctor will usually talk with you about your feelings, thoughts and mental health to distinguish between a short-term case of postpartum baby blues and a more severe form of depression. Don't be embarrassed, share your symptoms with your doctor so that a useful treatment plan can be created for you.
As part of your evaluation, doctor may:

Do a depression screening that may include having to fill out a questionnaire.
Advice blood tests to determine thyroid functions, and
other tests, to rule out other causes for symptoms.","Many options are there for managing PPD during pregnancy or after birth. Some women may participate in counseling (talk therapy); and others may need medication. There is no single treatment that works for everyone.
Treatment can include:
Counseling/Talk Therapy: 
Woman with PPD may have one-on-one therapy with just she and the therapist (a counselor, therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker) or group therapy where she meets with a therapist and other people with problems similar to her.
Another option is family or couple’s therapy, in which she and her family members or her partner may work with a therapist. Sometimes, therapy is needed for only a few weeks, but it may be needed for a few months or longer.
Counseling can be done with two ways:

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps people recognize and change their negative thoughts and behaviors.

Interpersonal therapy (IPT), which helps people understand and work through problematic personal relationships.

Support groups:These are groups of people who meet together or go online to share their feelings and experiences about certain topics. Counselor can suggest the support group to help.
Medicine: PPD often is treated with medicine. Several medications can treat depression effectively and are safe for pregnant women and for breastfeeding mothers and their babies.

Antidepressants.These are medicines used to treat many kinds of depression, including PPD. Some medicines are not safe to take during breastfeeding. Talk to your health care provider to find out about these medicines to decide which one is right for you.

Estrogen.This hormone plays an important role in menstrual cycle and pregnancy. During childbirth, the amount of estrogen in the body drops quickly.

In addition to treatment following things can be advised to new mothers to manage PPD:
Stay healthy and fit:

Do something active every day. Go for a walk or get back to the gym.
Eat healthy foods. These include fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads and lean meats. Try to eat fewer sweets and salty snacks.
Get as much rest as you can. Try to sleep when your baby sleeps.
Don’t drink alcohol. Alcohol is a depressant, and also can interact with the medicine given for PPD. You can pass alcohol to your baby through your breast milk.

Ask for and accept help:

Be with others: Keep in touch with people who care about you and share your feelings.
Make time for yourself: Do something for you, like getting out of the house, if a family member or your partner can look after the baby.
Be realistic: You don't have to do everything. You don't have to have the ""perfect"" home. Just do what you can and leave the rest.
Ask for help: Don't be afraid to ask for help from family and friends, whether it's caring for the baby or doing household chores.
Rest when the baby rests: Sleep is just as important for you as it is for the baby. Sleep when the baby sleeps, during naps and at night.
Reduce your stress:

Do the things that used to make you feel good about yourself before you got pregnant.
Do not make any major changes in your life right after having your baby.

Family members and friends may be the first to recognize symptoms of postpartum depression in a new mother. They can encourage her to talk with a health care provider, offer emotional support, and assist with daily tasks such as caring for the baby or the home.
Without treatment, postpartum depression can last for months or years. In addition to affecting the mother’s health, it can interfere with her ability to connect with and care for her baby and may cause the baby to have problems with sleeping, eating, and behavior as he or she grows."
Q Fever,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/q-fever,"Q fever is a bacterial infection caused by the coxiella burnetii bacteria. It causes flu-like symptoms such as a high temperature, muscle pain and headaches. The infection results from inhalation of a spore-like small cell variant, and from contact with the milk, urine, feces, vaginal mucus, or semen of infected animals. Rarely, the disease is also known as tick borne.
The ‘Q’ in Q fever stands for ‘query’. This is because when the infection was first indentified, its cause was unknown. The cause is now understood but the name has remained the sames.","Incubation period is usually two to three weeks. The most common manifestation is mild flu-like symptoms with:

Onset of fever
Malaise
Profuse perspiration
Severe headache
Myalgia (muscle pain)
Joint pain
Loss of appetite
Upper respiratory problems
Dry cough
Pleuritic pain
Chills
Confusion
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The fever lasts approximately 7 to 14 days.","Q fever is caused by bacteria known as coxiella burnetii (or c. burnetii). This bacteria generally spreads by animals infected by the bacteria.
The most commonly affected animals, and those that pose the biggest risk to humans, are:

Sheep
Cows
Goats
Domesticated pets, such as dogs, cats and guinea pigs","Q fever can be diagnosed using a blood test.
Blood test: If the c. burnetii bacteria that cause Q fever is present in blood, then immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will produce a type of protein called an antibody to kill them.","Antibiotics can be used for Q fever like doxycycline or tetracycline.
In pregnant women asdoxycycline and ciprofloxacin are contraindicated in pregnancy. The preferred treatment is five weeks of co-trimoxazole"
Quinsy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/quinsy,It is also known as peritonsillar abscess. It is collection of pus into tonsils and Peritonsilar space. The abscess (collection of pus) forms between one of tonsils and the wall of throat. This can happen when an infection spreads from an infected tonsil to the surrounding area.,"Symptoms of quinsy can include:

A worsening sore throat (usually on one side)
A high temperature of 100.4F or above
Difficulty in opening mouth
Pain during swallowing
Changes in voice or difficulty speaking
Bad breath
Earache on the affected side
Headache and feeling generally unwell
Swelling around face and neck","Peri Tonsillar Abscess is usually a complication of an untreated or partially treated acute tonsillitis. The infection, in these cases, spreads to the peritonsillar area (peritonsillitis). This region comprises loose connective tissue and is hence susceptible to formation of abscess.",The doctor may ask about symptoms and examine throat and tonsils,"Antibiotics are given to treat the infection. If the person is allergic to penicillin, clindamycin is generally administered.
Surgical incision and drainage of the pus is also done, thereby relieving the pain of the pressed tissues."
Rabies,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/rabies,"Rabies is a fatal viral infection that targets the brain and nervous system. The disease is zoonotic i.e. it can be transmitted from one species to another, such as from dogs to humans, commonly following a bite from an infected animal. For a human, rabies is almost always fatal if post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is not administered immediately following an exposure. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately affecting the brain and resulting in death. The rabies virus travels to the brain through the peripheral nerves. The incubation period of the disease i.e. the time lag between the bite/exposure to rabies and onset of symptoms of the disease, is usually about a few days to few months in humans, depending on the site and severity of exposure, the  distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system and other factors .

Raynaud's Phenomenon,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/raynaud-s-phenomenon,"It is a vasospastic disorder causing discoloration of the fingers, toes and occasionally other areas. It is a condition that leads to brittle nails with longitudinal ridges. Raynaud's phenomenon includes Raynaud's disease (also known as ""Primary Raynaud's phenomenon"") where the phenomenon is idiopathic.
Raynaud's phenomenon is an exaggeration of vasomotor responses to cold or emotional stress. Specifically, it is a hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system causing vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels, leading to tissue hypoxia. Chronic, recurrent cases of Raynaud's phenomenon can result in atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and muscle. In rare cases it can cause ulceration and ischemic gangrene.","The condition can cause pain within the affected extremities, discoloration (paleness), and sensations of cold and numbness. These changes to the skin usually happen in three stages:

Stage one: The affected body part turns white because blood supply is restricted
Stage two: It then turns blue due to lack of oxygen during this phase the body part can feel cold and numb
Stage three: The body part turns red as the blood returns at a higher rate than normal during this stage, there is tingling or throbbing sensation, and there may be some swelling in the affected body part.","Raynaud's phenomenon is the result of over-sensitive blood vessels in the body's extremities. In many cases, no cause is identified, although it is sometimes linked to other health conditions.
Primary Raynaud's: The most common form of Raynaud's phenomenon occurs by itself, without being associated with another health condition.
Secondary Raynaud's: In some cases, there is an underlying reason, associated with a health condition, that causes the blood vessels to overreact. This is called secondary Raynaud's.

Autoimmune conditions
Infections
Cancer
Injury due to overuse","Medical history taking by physician will often reveal whether the condition is primary or secondary. Once it is established, an examination is largely to identify possible secondary causes of Raynaud's phenomenon.

Digital artery pressure: Pressures are measured in the arteries of the fingers before and after the hands have been cooled. A decrease of at least 15 mmHg is diagnostic (positive).
Doppler ultrasound: To assess blood flow.
Full blood count: This reveal a normocytic anemia suggesting the anemia of chronic disease or renal failure.
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test:This blood test checks for antinuclear antibodies in blood. These antibodies are produced by immune system and attack body's own tissues.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate:This blood test measures how fast red blood cells settle to the bottom of a test tube. A faster-than-normal fall rate can indicate an autoimmune disorder.","It is mainly managed by managing the trigger factors in case of primary Raynaud's. Secondary Raynaud's can be treated by treating its underlying courses.
Drug therapy:Treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon may include prescription medicines such as calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) or diltiazem."
Rubella,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/respiratory-tract/rubella,"Rubella (also known as german measles) is a viral infection that used to be common in children. Rubella is usually a mild infection. It can be fatal usually with minimal systemic upset although transient arthropathy may occur in adults. Serious complications such as deterioration of the skin is very rare. Apart from the effects of transplacental infection on the developing fetus, rubella is a relatively trivial infection.
Acquired (i.e. not congenital) rubella is transmitted via airborne droplet emission from the upper respiratory tract of active cases (can be passed along by the breath of people sick from Rubella). The virus may also be present in the urine, feces and on the skin.","Incubation period is for 2-3 weeks. Symptoms include:

Flu like symptoms
Dry red-pink rash
Swollen lymph nodes
High temperature",Rubella is caused by the rubella virus (toga virus). The virus is spread through air by droplets from infected person to uninfected person.,"Blood test:
Blood is tested for antibodies like:

The IgM antibody will be present for new rubella infection.
The IgG antibody will be present for the rubella infection in the past, or have beenimmunizedagainst it.
If neither antibody is present, then there is no rubella infection and there is no immunization against it.",Symptomatic treatment is generally provided. Ibuprofen/ paracetamol are generally administered to relieve pain and fever. Patients are advised to drink plenty of fluids.
Retinopathy of Prematurity,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/retinopathy-of-prematurity,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), previously called retrolental fibroplasia, is a vaso-proliferative retinopathy which affects premature infants exposed to high concentration of oxygen. Retinopathy of prematurity often regresses but has the potential of causing visual impairment or blindness. ROP causes disorganised growth of retinal blood vessels which may lead to retinal scarring or even detachment of retina.
Retina has no blood vessels until fourth month of gestation. Thereafter, vessels emanate from hyaloid vessels at the optic disc and progress towards periphery. These vessels reach nasal periphery after eight months of gestation, but do not reach temporal periphery until about one month after delivery. Incompletely vascularised temporal part of retina is particularly susceptible to damage with oxygen therapy, particularly in premature infants. Pre-term birth affects normal retinal vascular maturation. Exposure to oxygen down-regulate retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), resulting in constriction/obliteration of blood vessels and delays normal retinal vascular development.
Significant ROP can lead to lifelong disability, especially in smallest survivors of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).",No Symptoms.,"Retinopathy of prematurity occurs in pre-term infants born before the normal growth of retinal blood vessels. Like other retinopathies, local ischaemia of retina plays a role in ROP.
Excessive oxygen exposure causes obliteration of blood vessels in immature retina. Oxygen saturation maintained at lower level from birth can reduce the rate of advancement of ROP.
Risk factors for ROP:
- Gestational age (32 weeks or less).
- Low birth weight (Less than 1500 grams).
- Extended use of supplemental oxygen.

Foetus in uterus is in hypoxic state as compared to life after birth. In pre-term infants, growth of retinal vessels is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, on exposure of immature retina to oxygen, the blood vessel constricts and can become obliterated resulting in delay of normal retinal vascular growth. This is the stage of hyperoxia-vasocessation.
Initially, the retina derives oxygen by diffusion from the underlying capillary bed of choroidal layer. The retina continues to grow in thickness and outgrows its vascular supply. But over the time, avascular retina becomes ischaemic and stimulates VEGF leading to hypoxia-vasoproliferation stage and manifest as arterio-venous shunts and neovascularisation.
Infants at risk are screened with appropriate timing of examination and follow up.","Diagnosis depends on the history of development and the clinical features.
Infants with lowest birth weights and youngest gestational ages are at increased risk of ROP.
Prolonged exposure to supplemental oxygen is a risk factor contributing to ROP.
Other predispositions with ROP are use of mechanical ventilation, patent ductus arteriosus, severity of associated illness (respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis or bronchopulmonary dysplasia).
Clinical features:
Active ROP:
The severity of active ROP is assessed according to location, extent, stage and ‘plus’ disease.
Location: Location of ROP is determined based on three zones with optic disc being at the center.
- Zone 1: It includes a circular area bounded by an imaginary circle, radius which is twice the distance from optic disc to macula.
- Zone 2: It includes an area extending from edge of zone 1 to a point tangential to Ora serrata (anterior limit of retina) and round to an area near equatorial temporal retina.
- Zone 3: This is the area consisting of residual temporal crescent lying anterior to zone 2.
Extent: This refers to the number of clock hours affected.
Stages: It refers to the clinical features according to the severity of ROP.
- Stage 1 (Demarcation line): The earliest sign of ROP is formation of a thin, tortuous, grey-white line running almost parallel to Ora serrata. This line is more prominent in peripheral part of temporal retina. It separates vascular posterior retina from avascular immature peripheral retina. Abnormal and branching blood vessels may form reaching up to the demarcation line.
- Stage 2 (Ridge formation): Demarcation line develops into a raised ridge of tissue which represents shunt joining veins with arteries. Isolated neovascular tufts may be seen posterior to it.
- Stage 3 (Ridge with extraretinal fibrovascular proliferation): There is fibrovascular proliferation over retina and into vitreous. The ridge becomes pink in colour.There is dilatation and tortuosity of the retinal blood vessels posterior to the equator. There may be retinal or vitreous haemorrhage.
- Stage 4 (Partial retinal detachment): The contraction of fibrovascular tissue leads to tractional retinal detachment which starts in extreme periphery and spreads towards the center.
- Stage 5 (Total retinal detachment): There is total detachment of retina.
‘Plus disease’: There is venous dilatation and tortuosity of arterioles in the posterior fundus (interior of the eyeball). When these vascular changes are present, a ‘Plus’ sign is added to the stage of disease.
Screening for ROP:
All infants born at less than 36 weeks or weighing less than 1500 grams, who have received oxygen therapy, should be screened for ROP.
The most useful time for screening is between post-conceptual ages of 32 to 36 weeks. This is because retinal detachment seldom develops before that and ROP rarely appears for the first time after 36 weeks. Before post-conceptual age of 31 weeks, screening is of limited value, because it is difficult to dilate pupils and there is vitreous haze due to the presence of tunica vasculosa lentis (capillary vasculature on posterior surface of lens which disappears after birth).

Cicatricial ROP:
Few patients with active ROP develop cicatricial complications. More advanced proliferative disease leads to more serious cicatricial sequlae. Various stages are:-
- Stage 1: This shows myopia with associated retinal pigmentary disturbance and haze at the base of vitreous.
- Stage 2: There is temporal vitreoretinal fibrosis with dragging of posterior retina.
- Stage 3: There is more severe peripheral fibrosis with contracture and falciform (sickle shaped) retinal fold.
- Stage 4: This shows partial ring of retrolental-fibrovascular tissue with partial retinal detachment.
- Stage 5: There is complete ring of retrolental fibrovascular tissue with total retinal detachment. Total retinal detachment may lead to secondary angle-closure glaucoma.

ROP should be differentiated from:-
- Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy: Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is a genetic disorder which occurs in full term infants.
- Persistent foetal vasculature: Persistent foetal vasculature, previously called persistent hyper-plastic primary vitreous (PHPV) is typically unilateral and is not related to prematurity. It can cause tractional retinal detachment.","The infant should be managed under medical supervision.
Ablative surgery is the mainstay of treatment. It is recommended for:-
- Zone 1 ROP: Any of the stage with ‘Plus’ disease.
- Zone 1 ROP: Stage 3 with no ‘Plus’ disease.
- Zone 2 ROP: Stage 2 or 3 with ‘Plus’ disease.
Ablation of avascular immature retina:
- Cryotherapy (use of low temperatures): Cryotherapy produces a reduction in unfavourable outcomes in threshold disease. Threshold disease is defined as five contiguous clock hours or eight non-contiguous clock hours of extra-retinal neovascularisation i.e. stage 3 disease in zone 1 or zone 2, associated with ‘Plus’ disease. It reduces the incidence of retinal detachment in many patients but some progress to retinal detachment in spite of treatment.
- Laser photocoagulation: Argon or Diode laser may be used to photocoagulate avascular areas of retina to reduce the incidence of complications. In spite of treatment, some patients still progress to develop complications like posterior pole macular fold or retinal detachment.
Vitreoretinal surgery:
Patients not responding to cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation may require vitreoretinal surgery to treat complications like retinal detachment.
Scleral Buckling:
Scleral buckling with or without pars plana vitrectomy may be done for cases with tractional retinal detachment. Visual outcome is usually not very good.
Role of vitamin E as antioxidant is controversial. Administration of vitamin E may produce undesirable side effects.
Follow up:
Yearly ophthalmologic follow-up evaluation is required. Depending upon the severity of disease, more frequent evaluations may be done.
Prognosis:
Visual prognosis is not good in infants developing retinal detachment. Retinal detachments commonly occur at 38-42 weeks postmenstrual age, in untreated patients.
Treatment of ROP reduces the risk and incidence of unfavourable outcome."
Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/recurrent-corneal-erosion-syndrome,"Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome (RCES), a corneal epithelial adhesion disorder, is a painful, often frightening, and sometimes incapacitating condition of the cornea. Corneal epithelial cells undergo erosions and results in denuded areas on the corneal surface. These areas then re-epithelise, the process recurs and the epithelial cells slough again. With many patients, erosions are characteristically episodic in nature.
Hansen in 1872, first described a set of symptoms consistent with RCES, and referred to the disorder as ‘intermittent neuralgic vesicular keratitis’. Von Szily in the year 1900, described principal features of RCES. Paul Chandler in 1945, divided the syndrome into a macroform and a microform type, with the macroform being associated more frequently with trauma. However, later observations confirmed that the two forms may occur simultaneously and there is no sharp distinction between them.
RCES may be diagnosed at almost any age and affects men and women equally. Even though the majority of patients give history of trauma, an underlying factor should be suspected when there is no history of trauma or surgery. Patients with RCES usually present with unilateral involvement, and the most commonly affected part is central part of the cornea just below the pupil. When the underlying cause is corneal dystrophy, symptoms are more often bilateral, localisation of the loosely adherent epithelium is more variable, and the management of symptoms often complicated. Trauma to the epithelium may be caused by a fingernail, plant material, sharp domestic objects, or the edge of a piece of paper. Salzmann’s nodular degeneration is another common acquired disorder that may be associated with recurrent corneal erosion syndrome. Rarely, cases may occur spontaneously without any obvious predisposing factor.
Most corneal erosions occur during the night or early morning hours and are described as an abrupt ripping sensation generally followed immediately by sharp pain, a marked foreign body sensation, watering, photophobia, visual disturbances, and often lid swelling. Some patients have mild symptoms every few months or years, and some experience severe, incapacitating, frequent erosions causing pain and other symptoms lasting for hours or days at a time.
In some patients with recurrent erosion, the epithelial defects never fully heal, and loose sheets of epithelium slide over the surface of the eye with each blink. These patients experience constant pain and may be some of the most distressed individuals. The unpredictable nature of recurrent erosions often heightens anxiety in patients. Patients may experience acute pain suddenly and would be unable to work or participate in normal activities for hours or days at a time.
Patients may be relatively free of symptoms, except for perhaps a mild ocular foreign body sensation or vague ‘awareness’ of the affected eye between episodes of erosions. This sensation of awareness can be most noticeable in dry, cold or windy environments.
It is not uncommon for patients with severe erosions to display signs of depression and anxiety. Since most of the erosions occur during sleep or on awakening, some patients fear falling asleep and experience varying degrees of insomnia. Disruption in normal sleep patterns may exacerbate psychological stress as well as the experience of the symptoms. Anxiety may even make erosions more frequent by causing patients to open their eyes more quickly on awakening and by inducing more rapid eye movements (REMs) as well as interfering with normal blinking and tear production.","Patients with RCES may experience ocular (eye) symptoms (may be triggered by a trivial mechanical trauma), typically on awakening, such as:

Mild to severe pain.
Discomfort.
Watering
Redness.
Photophobia.
Foreign body sensation.
Slightly blurred vision, if the visual axis is affected.
Diminution of vision.
Monocular (one eye) diplopia.
Astigmatism.
Epithelial blebs.
Lid swelling.","RCES may be associated with trauma or anterior corneal dystrophies.
In case of trauma, the initial insult causing corneal abrasion is commonly a slicing type injury, caused by a fingernail, brush, edge of a paper or even branch of a tree. The trauma to the eye is usually minor. Injuries induced by fingernails to the cornea are particularly at high risk of progressing to RCES. Old literature refers to RCES as ‘fingernail keratitis’. Injuries with fingernails, paper, or tree branches are more likely to induce RCES as compared to injuries with objects such as glass, rock or metal. Corneal trauma involving penetration into deeper stroma is less likely to induce RCES.
Causes of RCES are either primary or secondary depending on whether the basement membrane complex abnormalities are intrinsic or acquired. Secondary erosive disorders encompass all the conditions except corneal dystrophies. RCES is classified as (Das et al, 2008):
I Primary (Intrinsic):

Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy

- Cogan’s micro-cystic (map-dot-fingerprint) dystrophy (most common dystrophy causing RCES).

Dystrophy involving Bowman’s membrane

- Reis- Bϋcklers dystrophy.
- Thiel- Behnke dystrophy.

Stromal dystrophy

- Lattice dystrophy.
- Macular dystrophy.
II Secondary (Acquired):

Degeneration

- Band shaped keratopathy.
- Salzmann’s nodular degeneration.

Trauma     

            - Traumatic epithelial abrasions.
            - Chemical and thermal injury.

Eyelid pathology

- Ectropion.
- Entropion.
- Floppy eyelid syndrome.
- Lagophthalmos.
- Meibomian gland dysfunction.
- Blepharitis.

Following ocular (eye) infection

- Bacterial keratitis.
- Viral keratitis.

Following refractive surgery

- Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).
- Photorefractive keratectomy (RCES is rare).

Systemic causes such as

- Diabetes mellitus.
- Epidermolysis bullosa (a mucocutaneous autoimmune disease).


Pathophysiology:
The pathophysiology of RCES is only partially understood. Normal adhesion of the corneal epithelium depends primarily on structures known as attachment complexes, which are composed of elements from the basal epithelial cell, basement membrane, Bowman’s membrane and corneal stroma.
Electron microscopic examination and immunohistochemical staining methods shows that these elements possibly include hemidesmosomes, basal lamina, lamina densa, lamina lucida, anchoring fibrils, laminin, fibronectin, and Types IV and VII collagen. Abnormalities of epithelial adhesion resulting in recurrent erosions may be associated with previous traumatic abrasions or with corneal dystrophies.
Following injury, corneal epithelial defect is filled rapidly by epithelial cells sliding from adjacent epithelial basal layers. After this, epithelial cells begin mitosis and produce supra-basal epithelial cell layers. Sliding of basal epithelial cells can take place over either pre-existing basement membrane or bare stromal collagen. If the basement membrane remains intact after trauma, the new epithelial cell layer becomes firmly attached within a week. However, if the basement membrane is removed due to injury, some corneas appear unable to re-form normal attachment complexes, resulting in recurrent erosions occurring up to many years after the original injury.","Patients of RCES develop pain, watering, redness and photophobia that may vary from mild to severe. Some present with disease every day, but others have recurrences that may vary from every week or month to longer periods of time without any symptoms. Typically, pain is more severe at night or upon waking in the morning and may be related to REM during sleep or on opening of the eyelid. Patients are usually aware of this and they try to open the eyes gently every morning, but others refer that they are awakened in the middle of the night because of the pain. In acute phase of the disease, corneal erosion is always present, commonly in the lower half of the cornea, irrespective of the aetiology. This area of the cornea is in permanent contact with the tear film and lower lid and is most exposed to the evaporative dry eye disease.
The combination of a previous history of minor trauma to the involved eye, episodes of pain on awakening, and a rough irregular area of healing epithelium, is diagnostic of RCES.
Comparing patients following trauma with patients who had RCES secondary to epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, patients with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy were significantly more likely to be symptomatic.
Clinical signs: 
Careful slit lamp examination is needed to find the subtle signs of this syndrome, since the epithelium in many cases had already healed. The appearance of the cornea on slit lamp examination between the episodes of clinical symptoms may be normal. Sometimes, however, various degrees of epithelial or sub-epithelial oedema, located in the area of former erosion, may be seen during the asymptomatic intervals. This oedema may be subtle (minimal bedewing), discernible only with retro-illumination on slit lamp. Alternatively, a fine linear sub-epithelial opacity of fine bubbles or a distinct sub-epithelial bulla may be visible.
Clinical signs at slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) may show:

Delicate signs of basement membrane dystrophy.
Sites of previous erosion.
Clusters of small epithelial micro-cysts.
Gentle pressure applied to the cornea through the eyelid may demonstrate wrinkling of loosely adherent epithelium.

In many cases, no signs are found, and then the patient is instructed to return immediately after the next episode of pain, without allowing time for the epithelium to heal and cover the erosion. This will facilitate proper diagnosis and correct location of the lesion for the purpose of treatment.
Features of acute attack or during the first few days following the attack, in corneal epithelium: 

Loosely adherent and elevated epithelium.
Epithelial micro-cysts.
Corneal epithelial defects.
Stromal infiltrates and opacities may also develop at the site of the erosions.
Meibomian gland dysfunction.
Features of corneal dystrophy.
Tear film break up time (BUT) is often diminished on the affected areas.
Retro-illumination against red reflex (with dilated pupils) shows subtle changes of erosion in corneal epithelium.
Fluorescein stain may be negative. Corneal erosions are stained mainly by fluorescein, whereas devitalised but intact epithelium is stained exclusively by rose bengal.

The midline below the horizontal meridian is usually the last area to re-epithelise, and the closure lines at this area are predisposed to frequent breakdown. In addition, this is the area of maximal exposure, since it opposes the line of lids closure.
When no obvious signs of RCE are evident on the slit lamp examination, the presence of impaired epithelial adhesion is detected by:
Test for epithelial adherence: Epithelial adherence may be tested with a dry cellulose sponge, which is gently rubbed over the area of suspected epithelial erosion. If the intact epithelial sheet is moveable by the sponge, then the lack of adequate epithelial-stromal adhesion is suspected. Loosely adherent epithelium folds or break down, when touched with the tip of the sponge under local anaesthesia. Explore the inferior and central cornea, but any part may be affected.
Corneal topography (using computerised videokeratography): Corneal topography often reveals focal areas of corneal flattening (called corneal topographic lagoons) in eyes with RCES. This finding is important in those patients having frank symptoms but do not show epithelial abnormalities. Corneal topography may show an irregular ocular surface, which may explain visual symptoms such as diminution of vision or monocular diplopia.
Histology: The ultra-structural changes associated with RCES include:

Abnormal basal epithelial cell layer.
Prominent basal cell oedema of the epithelium.
Abnormal epithelial basement membrane.
Separation of the cells from their basement membrane.
Absent or abnormal hemidesmosomes.
Loss of anchoring fibrils.
Binucleated cells and multinucleated giant cells have been found in the corneal epithelium. Tonofibrils, prominent in the abnormal epithelial cells, are probably responsible for forming binucleated cells.
All layers of the epithelium are infiltrated with neutrophils.

Confocal microscopy: Confocal microscopy in patients with RCES associated with anterior corneal dystrophies, discloses structural changes in the basal epithelium, basement membrane, Bowman’s membrane, anterior stroma, and corneal neurons.
Electron microscopy: Electron microscopy shows absence of hemidesmosomes and in some cases the absence of entire thickness of basement membrane. Thinning and splitting of basement membrane may also be present. Epithelial cells may be responsible for abnormal production and attachment of the basement membrane. The presence of high number of mitochondria with abnormal shape in the basal epithelial cells, seen as intracellular vacuoles, suggests an abnormal metabolic activity.

Differential Diagnosis:
Recurrent breakdown of corneal epithelium may be seen in:

Exposure keratopathy.
Neurotrophic keratopathy with painless corneal erosions.
Recurrence of herpes simplex stromal keratitis and may show an epithelial defect. Past history of dendritic corneal ulceration, gradual onset of pain and deep stromal infiltration in herpes simplex stromal keratitis distinguishes this from true recurrent corneal erosion.
Hard and roughened tarsal plate.
Foreign body under the tarsal plate.
Self- inflicted corneal injury (rare).","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Till date, no single therapy is found to be definitive and sufficiently effective. The therapy of RCES is palliative rather than curative. The disease may be annoying, but is not vision threatening.
Goals of management:

Primary goals of management: The primary goals of management of RCES during the acute attacks include pain relief and promotion of fast and prolonged epithelialisation.
Long-term goals of management: Long-term goals of RCES management are stabilisation of the healed epithelium and prevention of subsequent erosion episodes.

These goals are not easily achieved, and the chronic course of resistant cases of RCES may be frustrating for both patient and physician. Typically, a stepladder approach, beginning with conservative measures and moving on to invasive intervention, is followed. Adjuvant therapy e.g. cycloplegics, offer additional relief in symptoms.
Over the years, multiple treatment strategies were developed, including topical conservative treatments, such as hypertonic lubricants, soft bandage contact lenses and various aggressive surgical modalities, such as anterior stromal puncture and phototherapeutic refractive keratectomy, which aim at creating a new basement membrane-epithelial interface.
Tailoring the proper treatment strategy to each patient is the key to a successful control of RCES.
Medical therapy:
Medical therapy includes:

Slow eye movements on awakening and gradual lid opening.
Patching and a topical antibiotic ointment: Patching and a topical antibiotic ointment may be applied in acute episodes of RCES.
Topical artificial tears (lubricants): To prevent the disease, the most widely used therapies include topical lubricants. Topical lubricants can be administered as drops, gels or ointment. The bed time application of an ointment will reduce the amount of friction between the tarsal conjunctiva and corneal epithelium overnight, during the REM, and will protect corneal epithelium from the shearing action of the eyelids upon awakening, which is the major trigger of recurrence.
Hyper-osmotic agents: Hyper-osmotic agents are also routinely used in RCES. During sleep there is a relative hypo-tonicity of the tear film as a result of decreased tear fluid evaporation. The reduced tear osmolarity at night will cause a shift of water from the tear film into the cornea, resulting in a relative corneal epithelial oedema and decreased epithelial adhesion. Hypertonic (5%) sodium chloride, either drops or ointment, will promote epithelial adherence by increasing the tear osmolarity, thereby, decreasing epithelial oedema and promoting epithelial adherence. These agents should be continued for few months after the last attack, as it takes a few months for the adhesion complexes to build up.


The majority of cases are mild and do well with these conservative treatments (topical lubricants and hyper-osmotic agents), which are effective in relieving pain and promoting initial epithelial growth. However, these modalities will not reduce the likelihood of recurrences.
Useful advice for patients is to move their eyes slowly to the left and right before opening them, and to gradually retract the lower lid, to facilitate gradual separation between the tarsal conjunctiva and the corneal epithelium. This slower separation of the cornea from the tarsal conjunctiva will prevent the shearing force created on the corneal epithelium during abrupt lid opening, and will prevent the erosion.
Other medical therapy includes:

Osmotic colloidal solutions.
Temporary soft bandage contact lenses: Temporary soft bandage contact lenses promote epithelial migration and regeneration of basement membrane by protecting the corneal epithelium from the friction by the upper tarsal conjunctiva. To be effective, a bandage contact lens should be worn for few weeks to several months replacing it every two weeks. This may enable the formation of stable adhesion complexes between the corneal epithelium and the basement membrane.

These contact lenses should be used under close medical supervision, since long-term continuous use of contact lenses may lead to bacterial keratitis and neovascularisation. However, silicone hydro-gel extended wear contact lenses, in recent years, have significantly increased the safety of long-term use of bandage contact lenses.
Soft bandage contact lenses are often not effective in preventing further erosions except in cases where abnormalities in lid anatomy play a significant causative role in the erosions.

Autologous serum: Autologous serum has been used effectively in RCES, significantly reducing the incidence of recurrence. It is composed of substances that are essential for epithelial healing, such as vitamin A, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta, and fibronectin (FN). FN promotes epithelial cell migration and participates in the adhesion process. The lipids in the serum may act as a substitute for the lipids produced by the meibomian glands. Autologous serum is safe and no adverse effects have been reported with its use.
Umbilical cord serum: Umbilical cord serum contains a higher concentration of growth factors and may be shown to be more effective in decreasing symptoms and keratoepitheliopathy in dry eyes and Sjögren syndrome. In a small study of patients treated with artificial tears alone compared with artificial tears along with umbilical cord serum drops, there was a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence, in later group. A large amount of serum can be obtained from the umbilical cord vein at one time and as a result, many patients can benefit from one sample. Also, the lack of major histocompatibility complex (HCC) class II expression and the low expression of major HCC class I on umbilical cord tissue-derived cells may result in reduced immunogenicity. The possibility of transmission of blood-borne diseases, storage requirements, risk of allergies, and the potential risk of bacterial contamination may be problematic issues. The use of umbilical cord serum for RCES may be found to be effective in reducing the number of recurrences.
Trophic growth factors (TGFs): Numerous investigational trophic growth factors (TGFs) are demonstrated to be effective in treating some patients with erosion, especially in patients with more severe types of epitheliopathy, such as those associated with long-term diabetes mellitus or neurotrophic keratopathy.
Treatment of lid disease: Certain diseases like meibomian gland disease (MGD) and chronic blepharitis are associated with RCES. The tear film in MGD may have increased levels of bacterial lipases, fatty acids, interleukins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which may interfere with corneal epithelial healing. Therefore, the usual therapeutic measures of MGD should be used in RCES as well. These include lid hygiene and oral tetracyclines. Oral tetracyclines decreases episodes of RCES by reducing free fatty acids in the tear film of MGD, by inactivating the MMPs, and by reducing the numbers of colony forming units (CFUs) from lid cultures. Low doses of tetracyclines may be continued for a few months.
Botulinum toxin induced ptosis (drooping of eyelid): Botulinum toxin induced ptosis (drooping of eyelid) may be done to cover the corneal erosions in RCES resistant to simple measures.
Oral matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors: MMP enzymes (MMP- 2 and MMP-9), produced by corneal epithelium as well, have roles in the wound healing process, and are part of the inflammatory activity in many ocular surface disorders. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2, may be responsible for the degradation of anchoring molecules in the adhesion complexes of the basement membrane during epithelial healing. MMP inhibitors may be used in the treatment of resistant RCES. A combination of oral doxycycline and topical steroid has been used in recalcitrant cases of RCES. The combination of topical steroids and doxycycline can inhibit the inflammatory cytokines and MMPs and promote rapid resolution, and prevent further recurrence in RCES. The use of topical steroids in the treatment of RCES must, however, be weighed against the potential risks of infection, cataract and intraocular pressure elevation.


Surgical therapy:
In patients where consistent, aggressive medical management fails to resolve the erosions, surgical therapy may be required.
Indications of surgery: 

Aggressive medical management does not improve signs and symptoms of erosions.
Patients continued pain and presence of epithelial defects, interfering with normal activities.
Presence of recurring epithelial defects may result in infectious keratitis.

Choice of surgical approach is determined by: 

Frequency and severity of erosions.
Presence of concomitant dystrophy or other diseases.
Aetiology and location of erosions.
Patients need and desires.

Surgical therapy may be highly effective. Over the years, a series of surgical procedures have been described for RCES, including diamond burr polishing of Bowman’s membrane, anterior stromal puncture with an insulin needle or with neodymium- doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, and excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). As these procedures result in high success rates and carry low risks, it is advisable not to defer the surgical options if the medical therapy fails. Historically, debridement and then superficial keratectomy were the first surgical approaches to the treatment of RCES, and these procedures are still in use today.

Debridement of loose epithelium: Epithelial debridement is indicated when a large area of the epithelium is loose and mobile with lid movements. Debridement of this large area of loose epithelium is necessary for pain relief, and can promote healing from the healthy adherent edges of the intact epithelium. Preoperatively, topical non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as eyedrops (bromefenac, ketorolac tromethamine or diclofenac) helps in pain management in patients for debridement. Epithelial debridement may be performed under topical anaesthesia using slit lamp, by removing the loose epithelium with a sterile sponge. Postoperatively, these drops are continued and therapeutic bandage contact lens may be prescribed if the epithelial defect is large. Topical antibiotics and cycloplegic eye drops may be required. Epithelial debridement alone cannot reduce the recurrences of epithelial erosions.

The suboptimal efficacy and limitations of this procedure derive from the fact that no significant modifications to enhance epithelial adhesions are made in Bowman’s membrane or other deeper corneal structures.
A technique known as alcohol delamination of the corneal epithelium has been proposed to improve the efficacy of debridement in the treatment of recurrent erosions. Debridement and removal of abnormal or reduplicated epithelium are most effective in cases where localised areas of such epithelium interfere with visual acuity by inducing refractive changes.

Large superficial epithelial keratectomy: Large superficial epithelial keratectomy is a more aggressive approach, generally requires the use of an operating microscope. This technique is much more likely to benefit patients with recurrent erosions. Like debridement, preoperative topical non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as eyedrops (bromefenac, ketorolac tromethamine or diclofenac) helps in pain management in patients for superficial epithelial keratectomy procedures. Postoperatively, these drops are continued and therapeutic bandage contact lens may be prescribed.

The optimum candidate for this procedure is one having:
- Spontaneous multiple erosions in different areas of cornea.
- No history of trauma.
- Severe basement dystrophy, resulting in poor vision.
- Large areas of loosely adherent irregular epithelium.

Anterior stromal puncture using needle: Anterior stromal puncture is a highly effective and widely used technique, involving the use of a needle to make multiple shallow penetrations through the epithelium into anterior corneal stroma, thus, improving epithelial adhesion. When discussing with patients, the term epithelial reinforcement may be substituted for stromal puncture to allay patient anxiety. Epithelial reinforcement may be performed either between erosive episodes or through loose, irregular epithelium during an active erosive phase without the need for debridement. This procedure incites reactive fibrosis/ scarring, and production of extra cellular matrix proteins that are responsible for proper adhesion of the epithelium to its substrate. The procedure is performed under topical anaesthesia. Preoperative NSAIDS (ketorolac or diclofenac) and antibiotic cover (fluoroquinolone or other antibiotic) is given for management of pain and infection, respectively. Fluorescein sodium may be instilled topically before the treatment to define the affected area. Perpendicular multiple superficial punctures are placed about 0.5mm apart in the affected area. Treatment is extended to 1-2 mm into the normal epithelium bordering the lesion, because the loose epithelium usually extends beyond the visible limits of the erosion. Treatment within the pupil area should be minimised, if possible. Since anterior stromal puncture may result in sub epithelial scars, its use is not advisable if the erosion directly involves the visual axis, since a central scar may result in glare and a reduction in visual acuity. Immediately after the treatment, a bandage contact lens is placed and antibiotics are given for about one week.

Once re-epithelialisation has occurred, hyper-osmotic ointments are used to lubricate and protect the delicate healed epithelial tissue.
Failure of anterior stromal puncture treatment in few patients is due to small treatment area, and erosions then develop outside of the treated area. A second, larger treatment can often resolve erosions in patients in whom the initial procedure is unsuccessful.
Anterior stromal puncture has also been tried/ used in patients with corneal erosions associated with bullous keratopathy. Although corneal stromal oedema is generally well tolerated, rupture of epithelial bullae and the resulting corneal erosions in these patients can be very painful. For some of these bullous keratopathy patients with erosions, who are poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty because of poor visual potential or medical contraindications, anterior stromal puncture has been shown to be a useful treatment. Anterior stromal puncture can also be used to control painful erosions in patients with bullous keratopathy who are awaiting corneal transplantation. The optimum patients for this type of treatment are those whose bullae are localised and not diffusely distributed throughout the cornea.

Anterior stromal puncture using neodymium- doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser: Anterior stromal puncture may also be performed with a short-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The advantage of laser puncture over needle puncture is that the laser puncture is more reproducible, shallow, and translucent.
Neodymium- doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser keratectomy.
Microdiathermy.
Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Partial ablation of Bowman’s layer, with excimer laser PTK, provides smooth bed for migrating epithelium, and results in new hemidesmosomal adhesion complexes. The basal epithelial layer forms hemidesmosomes and new basement membrane within two weeks of laser photo-ablation. Thus, new hemidesmosomes, anchoring fibrils, and epithelial basement membrane are synthesised rapidly and in increasing amounts after PTK. In addition, removing the basement membrane allows the epithelium to come into direct contact with stromal elements, stimulating the synthesis of new anchoring fibrils and hemidesmosomes.

The aim is to remove a 6.0-mm diameter of thick anterior stromal layer. The eye is patched after putting cycloplegic and antibiotic drops. Bandage contact lens may be required during the postoperative period.
PTK results in a higher rate of success for RCES following trauma than corneal dystrophies.
 Advantages of PTK are:
- Removal of corneal tissue with extreme precision.
- Precision helps in preventing damage to the non-ablated area.
- Simultaneous treatment of wider areas.
 Disadvantages of PTK are:
- Postoperative discomfort.
- Hypermetropic (hyperopic) shift is caused by the central flattening of the cornea. More advanced PTK, based on flying spot beam profiles, is associated with fewer undesirable refractive changes, compared to those with older, broader beam lasers.


Diamond burr superficial keratectomy (DBSK): Epithelial debridement and diamond burr polishing of Bowman’s membrane is another, less commonly used option in the treatment of RCES. This procedure includes the debridement of loose sheets of epithelium from the cornea using a combination of peeling with forceps and gentle wiping with a cellulose sponge. If the erosion is within the visual axis, the entire corneal surface is polished with a fine diamond burr. The limbal epithelium is left intact in 1-2 mm circumferential periphery. Treatment is limited to the anterior part of Bowman’s layer. A bandage contact lens is applied and antibiotics are given following treatment.

 Advantages of diamond burr polishing are:
- The results of diamond burr polishing are comparable to those of PTK.
- A subtle granular sub-epithelial deposit is initially noticed which clears in about three months postoperatively. A study on RCES and anterior basement membrane dystrophy showed significantly less haze after diamond burr polishing as compared to PTK.
- Diamond burr polishing is a simple, less expensive procedure with fewer recurrences as compared to PTK.
- Diamond burr polishing can be used to treat RCES involving the visual axis.

Prognosis:

Overall, the prognosis is very good to excellent with proper care. Unless there is an ongoing underlying corneal disease, most patients ultimately have healed cornea and do not have any more episodes. However, the healing process itself may take many years.
While most patients respond well to conservative medical therapy, surgical means in the form of epithelial debridement, anterior stromal puncture, excimer laser PTK, or diamond burr polishing of the Bowman’s membrane have excellent success rates. As these procedures result in high success rates and carry low risks, it is advisable not to defer the surgical options if the medical therapy fails."
Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/rheumatic-fever-and-rheumatic-heart-disease,"Rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are major public health problems among children and young adults in developing countries; though RF/RHD has declined in developed countries. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an illness caused by an immunological reaction to infection with the bacterium group A streptococcus (GAS). RF affects connective tissues, and may result in rheumatic heart disease which may progress to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and embolic stroke.
RF and RHD are nonsuppurative complications of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis (sore throat) due to a delayed immune response. Group A streptococcal infection is endemic throughout the world, but epidemics are common, particularly among schoolchildren, in residential facilities for the elderly, and in other unique populations such as military personnel. ARF, considered as a classical disease of poverty, commonly appears in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years in developing countries. It occurs 1–3 weeks after an untreated GAS pharyngitis and is an inflammatory disease, with marked tendency to recur.
The consequences of RF and RHD include continuing damage to the heart, increasing disability, repeated hospitalization, and premature death.
World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005 estimated that there are about 15.6 million cases of RHD world-wide. A vast majority of cases are in developing countries. About 2, 82,000 new cases of RHD and over 4, 70,000 new cases of RF occur every year, and 2, 33,000 people die due to RHD each year.
In India population based study indicates prevalence of RHD to be about 2/1000 population, however survey conducted in school children in the age group of 5-16 years by ICMR gives overall prevalence of 6/1000(range 1.8 to 11/1000).
Rheumatic fever is endemic in India and remains one of the major causes of cardiovascular disease, accounting for nearly 25-45% of the acquired heart disease.
The burden of ARF in industrialized countries declined dramatically during the 20th century, due to improved living conditions and increased hygiene standards, along with better access to appropriate health services and increased access to penicillin-based medications. In many developing countries, lack of awareness of these measures, coupled with shortages of money and resources, are important barriers to the control of the disease.
Early treatment of streptococcal sore throat can prevent the development of rheumatic fever. Regular long term penicillin treatment can prevent rheumatic fever becoming rheumatic heart disease, and can halt disease progression in people whose heart valves are already damaged by the disease. RF/RHD is a neglected public health problem in India. If treated, 75% of people with rheumatic fever recover completely. RHD is one of the preventable chronic disorders of heart.","Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is preceded by sore throat. Sore throats are caused by a variety of bacteria and viruses and commonly affect all age groups; however, important symptoms and signs of Streptococcus sore throat are- 

High Temperature,
Tender cervical lymph nodes,
Redness of pharynx,
Pus like exudates on pharynx &amp; throat,
Bleeding spots in the throat,
Pain while swallowing,

Signs of common cold, conjunctivitis, running nose, hoarseness of voice are not by themselves suggestive of this infection. Special tests such as culture of the throat are needed for laboratory confirmation. If group A Streptococcal pharyngitis is not treated then some children can get affected by Rheumatic fever (RF).
In RF typically, the child may complain of fever, accompanied by following symptoms-
Arthritis- Pain and swelling of joints is the common symptom of the ARF, occurring in up to 75% of patients in the first attack of RF. Larger joints such as knees, ankles, elbows and wrists on both sides of body are usually affected. There is sequential involvement of joints, with each completing a cycle of inflammation and resolution. There is excruciating pain on touch. Symptoms of arthritis pass within four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage.
Carditis (inflammation of heart) occurs in an estimated 30-60% of people with rheumatic fever. Symptoms may be seen in the form of shortness of breath, persistent cough, rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), chest pain, and feeling of tiredness all the time.
Subcutaneous nodules- Round, firm, freely movable, painless nodules varying in size from 0.5–2.0cm are found over bony prominences or extensor tendons.
Rheumatic chorea- About 1 in four children with rheumatic fever can develop involuntary and uncontrolled jerking and twitching of the body, mostly hands and feet, difficulty in performing task requiring fine hand movements such as writing, problem with balance, unusual emotional outbursts, such as crying or laughing for no apparent reason. These symptoms pass within few months.
Skin rash- About one in ten children of rheumatic fever skin rash develops known as erythema marginatum. The rash is painless, non-itchy and subsides usually within few weeks or months.
Less common symptoms of ARF include high temperature, abdominal pain, bleeding nose.","Rheumatic fever is caused by the immune system overreacting to the presence of group A streptococcus bacteria. During infection theimmune systemfights the infection by producing antibodies to proteins on the surface of the bacteria. In certain strains of group A streptococcal bacteria, the proteins on the bacteria appear similar to proteins in the human cells and the immune system begins to attack human cells with similar proteins such as heart, joints, skin. 
RF and RHD are epidemiologically associated with Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis. Streptococci are a large group of gram-positive, nonmotile, non–spore-forming cocci about 0.5-1.2 µm in size.
Streptococcus pyogenes causes a wide variety of diseases in humans. It is one of the most common causes of acute bacterial pharyngitis that leads to RF/RHD. Impetigo, a common skin infection, is also caused by S. pyogenes and is associated with acute glomerulonephritis (AGN). In rare cases, S. pyogenes causes invasive diseases such as cellulitis, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome (TSS).
The risk of an attack of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) following GAS pharyngitis has been reported to be 0.3% under endemic conditions to 3% during epidemic conditions. During the winter and spring seasons in temperate climates, up to 20% of the school-aged children may be GAS carriers. The commonest age group involved is 5-15 years with no sex predisposition.
RF is linked to overcrowding in poor housing conditions (due to increased GAS infection). It declines sharply when the standard of living improves.","There is currently no single test to diagnose acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and the identification of a number of signs and symptoms that are associated with the illness. Signs and symptoms of ARF are divided into two categories: major and minor.
Major signs and symptoms are strongly associated with ARF and include carditis (swelling of the heart), arthritis (pain, redness and swelling of one or more joints), Sydenham’s chorea (strange movements of the body and face), erythema marginatum (painless skin pigmentation), and subcutaneous nodules (small lumps under the skin).
Minor signs and symptoms are used to help support the diagnosis. These include fever, arthralgia (generalised joint aches), blood tests that suggest general illness (elevated ESR), and changes seen on electrocardiogram (Increased P-R interval).
Jones criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever-The Jones criteria were introduced in 1944 as a set of clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever (RF). According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of RF can be made when two of the major criteria or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of Streptococcal infection (Streptococcal serum antibody tests).
Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is most accurately diagnosed using ultrasound. Ultrasound of the heart is referred to as echocardiography.","Management of Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is based on treating infection and relieving symptoms. This includes:

antibiotics to treat the streptococcal infection,
medication to reduce arthritis and fever,
rest, and
a healthy diet.

Following ARF diagnosis regular secondary prevention in the form of prophylaxis with antibiotic is started to prevent recurrent ARF and heart damage. The regular intramuscular injection of repository penicillin (benzathine benzylpenicillin) is given every three to four weeks interval.
For patients for whom the regular and repeated injections of benzathine benzylpenicillin are not given, daily oral phenoxymethylpenicillin may be used. An oral sulfonamide is recommended for secondary prophylaxis to patients known to be allergic to penicillin. For individuals who cannot take either penicillin or sulfadiazine, erythromycin may be used. The duration of secondary prophylaxis is managed by the physician for each patient individually."
Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/ramsay-hunt-syndrome,"Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome or Herpes zoster oticus is a syndrome characterised by acute otalgia, herpetic vesicular rash associated with facial palsy. This is the second most common cause of facial paralysis and is due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that remains dormant/latent in the geniculate ganglion after primary infection with chickenpox. Characteristic presentation is severe acute otalgia with unilateral facial paralysis. Vesicular eruptions if not present initially, may appear usually within three to five days. The vesicles may appear on post-auricular skin, pinna, concha, ear canal, and tympanic membrane. Occasionally it may affect neck, shoulder or oral cavity. Besides facial nerve, it may affect other cranial nerves as well.
Ramsay-Hunt in 1907 first described Herpes zoster oticus in a patient with otalgia associated with cutaneous and mucosal rashes, which was ascribed to geniculate ganglion infection with varicella zoster virus (human herpes virus type 3). This syndrome is also known by the names geniculate neuralgia or nervus intermedius neuralgia.
As compared to Bell’s palsy, the symptoms are more severe and carries worse prognosis in Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The risk and frequency of complete facial nerve degeneration is substantially higher than the Bell’s palsy. Patients with vestibular and auditory dysfunction in addition to facial paralysis generally also have worse prognosis. Patients with diabetes, hypertension and advanced age have poorer prognosis.
Bilateral Ramsay Hunt syndrome has also been reported in diabetic patients or immunocompromised patients.
Other cranial nerve neuropathies e.g. neuropathy of V,VI,VIII,IX, and X, may be associated with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.","Commonly, Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a disease affecting elderly people or someone with immune deficiency. However, it may be seen in younger patients under conditions of stress.
Symptoms may include

Paroxysmal pain deep within the ear, which precedes rashes
Herpetiform eruptions
Impaired hearing
Vertigo
Facial nerve palsy
Loss of sensation of taste in anterior two third of tongue
Nystagmus","Ramsay Hunt syndrome iscauseddue to reactivation ofVaricella zoster virus (VZV) lying dormant in geniculate ganglion.
Primary infection with Varicella zoster virus (VZV), known as varicella or chickenpox is a common erythematous infection of the paediatric age group. VZV remains dormant in cranial nerve neurons and dorsal root ganglia. Subsequent reactivation, more so during periods of stress, may result in prodromal period of severe pain followed by localised vesicular rash, known as herpes zoster infection.
In Ramsay Hunt syndrome, patient develop otalgia associated with mucosal and cutaneous lesions, due to reactivation of infection in geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve with varicella zoster virus (human herpes virus type 3).","Diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is based upon the clinical history of otalgia associated with vesicular lesions or eschars, and facial paralysis.
Prodromal symptoms of fatigue for one to two weeks is followed by phase of vesicular eruptions. Erythematous macules/papules develop around ear (commonly affecting concha or external auditory canal). Soon it turns into vesicles which may ulcerate.
The clinical presentation varies in severity from case to case. General features include periauricular pain, herpetiform eruptions and neural dysfunction, involving VII and VIII cranial nerve predominantly.

Histology:
There is swelling and inflammation of the ganglion of affected cranial nerve with VZV. Inflammation is predominantly lymphocytic in nature. Some cells of the ganglion show swelling and others may be degenerated.

Investigations:

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Magnetic Resonance Imaging shows enhancement of a large portion of facial nerve. Often the vestibular and cochlear nerve, labyrinth, and dura lining internal auditory canal may also show enhancement.
Brainstem auditory evoked response: Brainstem auditory evoked response shows significant increase in latencies of certain waves, and also inter-peak latencies in others.

Saliva: VZV DNA level in saliva helps to understand viral reactivation in facial nerve and oropharyngeal epithelium.
Cerebrospinal fluid: Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of CSF may be done to diagnose this virus.

Routine imaging is unnecessary. Even electro-diagnostic studies are unreliable in Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

Differential diagnosis
Primary initial differentiation is between facial neuropathy and a diagnosis of stroke. Once it is ascertained that the diagnosis is not stroke, than the differentiation is between Bell’s palsy and secondary causes of facial neuropathy. Bell’s palsy accounts for up to 70% of facial neuropathies. Clue to secondary causes include involvement of other cranial nerves or neurologic diseases. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is the second most common cause. The external auditory canal, mouth and tongue should be examined for vesicles to distinguish this condition from Bell’s palsy.
Other conditions to be distinguished are

Lyme disease
Guillain-Barré syndrome
Meningitis
HIV infection.","Management includes
Medical therapy
Combination of steroids and antiviral agents: Use of Combination of steroids and antiviral agents have shown a higher recovery rate. In one study, it was clearly shown that patients treated within three days of the onset showed complete recovery in seventy five present of patients, whereas, only thirty percent showed complete recovery when treated after seven days. Patients show rapid reduction of pain, and occasionally experience return of facial movement.
Due to diffuse neuritis with intervening ‘skip’ regions of facial nerve, surgical decompression of nerve in Ramsay Hunt syndrome is not recommended.

Prognosis
With early onset of medical therapy within three days, almost or complete resolution is seen in most of the cases. Cases missing indicative cutaneous symptoms (zoster sine herpete), but showing combination of otalgia, sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo or any kind of facial paresis, raises suspicion of Ramsay Hunt syndrome."
Sarcoidosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/lungs/sarcoidosis,"Sarcoidosis is characterized by the presence of collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas). The disease primarily affects the lungs, but granulomas can also form in the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, and skin, and less often in the spleen, bones, joints, sinuses, skeletal muscles, kidneys, heart, reproductive organs, salivary glands, and nervous system. The granulomas may eventually disappear completely or become scar tissue.","Symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending upon the organ affected:

Generalized symptoms:

Fever

Abnormal breathing sounds (such as rales)
Enlarged liver
Enlarged lymph glands
Enlarged spleen
Rash

Different imaging tests may help diagnose sarcoidosis:

Chest x-ray to see if the lungs are involved or lymph nodes are enlarged
CT scan of the chest
Lung gallium scan","Medicinal: Steroids are generally prescribed to keep inflammation under control.
Surgery: Organ transplant may be considered if sarcoidosis has severely damaged lungs or liver."
Sarcoma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/sarcoma,"Sarcoma is a cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin . Malignant tumors made of cancellous bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, vascular, or hematopoietic tissues are considered sarcomas. There are three main types of sarcoma:soft tissue sarcoma,bone arcomaandgastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) and 100 sub types of sarcoma.
The four common types of bone sarcomas are:
Osteosarcoma:It is the most common type of bone cancer. Most cases develop in children and young people who are between the ages of 5 and 20, making it the third most common cancer in young people (afterleukemiaand brain tumors). Osteosarcoma usually develops in the larger bones, such as the thigh bone (femur) or the shin bone (tibia).
Ewing's sarcoma:Ewing's sarcoma usually develops inpelvis, thigh bone or shin bone and mostcommonlyoccurs inchildren and young people aged between 10 and 20 years.
Chondrosarcoma:This type of bone cancer usually develops in adults who are between the ages of 40 and 50. The most common sites for chondrosarcoma to develop are pelvis, thigh bone, upper arm bone, shoulder blade (scapula) and the ribs.
Cordoma: The majority of cordoma arise in the sacrum, base of the skull and spines, but it affects older adults aged 40 or over.","The most common symptom of bone cancer is bone pain. It generally begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone, and then gradually progresses to a persistent ache that often feels worse during the night or while using the affected bone. Others symptoms of bone cancer include:

A high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
Unexplained weight loss
Sweating usually at night",Cancer generally begins with the change in the DNA structure known as mutations.,"X-rays: X-rays can often detect damage to the bones that is caused by cancer or any new bone that's growing because of cancer.
MRI scan: An MRI scan is an effective way of assessing the size and spread of any cancerous tumor inside the bones.
Biopsy: The other most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. This is known as a biopsy.","Chemotherapy:Itis generally done to shrink the size of tumor and to treat any cancerous cells that may have spread.
Surgery:Following chemotherapy, surgery may be carried out to remove the section of cancerous bone. In many cases, it is possible to reconstruct the bone that has been removed. This is known as limb-sparing surgery. Following surgery, further chemotherapy treatment may be given to destroy any remaining cancerous cells.
Radiotherapy:It isalso used for treatment and is particularly helpful for some types of cancer (such as Ewing’s sarcoma)."
Schizophrenia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms.

Hallucinations - Hearing or seeing things that do not exist
Delusions - Unusual beliefs not based on reality which often contradict the evidence
Confused thoughts based on the hallucinations or delusions
Changes in behaviour

People with schizophrenia are likely to have additional conditions, including major depression and anxiety disorders.","Changes in thinking and behavior are the most characteristic signs of schizophrenia. These include:
1) Hallucinations: A hallucination is when a person experiences a sensation but there is nothing or nobody there to account for it.
2) Delusions: A delusion is a belief held with complete conviction, even though it is based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view.
3) Confused thoughts (thought disorder): People experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations.
4) Changes in behavior and thoughts: Behavior may become more disorganized and unpredictable, and appearance or dress may seem unusual to others.","The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. It is suggested that a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can make people more likely to develop the condition.
Risks factors:
Genetics: Schizophrenia tends to run in families, but no individual gene is found responsible.
Neurotransmitters: These are chemicals that carry messages between brain cells. There is a connection between neurotransmitters and schizophrenia because drugs that alter the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain are known to relieve some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.
Pregnancy and birth complications

Bleeding during pregnancy, gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia
Abnormal growth of a baby while in the womb, including low birth weight or reduced head circumference
Exposure to a virus while in the womb
Complications during birth, such as a lack of oxygen (asphyxia) and emergency caesarean section

Stress: The main psychological triggers of schizophrenia are stressful life events, such as bereavement, losing your job or home, a divorce or the end of a relationship, or physical, sexual, emotional or racial abuse.
Drug abuse: Certain drugs, particularly cannabis, cocaine, LSD or amphetamines, may trigger some symptoms of schizophrenia, especially in people who are susceptible.",No tests are available.Generally diagnosis is based on presenting symptoms .,"The treatment of schizophrenia is with antipsychotic medications, often combined with psychological and social support .
Medication: The first-line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which can reduce the symptoms in about 7–14 days.

Family therapy
Assertive community treatment
Supported employment
Cognitive remediation"
Scurvy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/scurvy,"Scurvy is a medical condition that can develops due to deficiency of vitamin C in diet. Vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid) is vital for the body as it is needed to make collagen. Collagen is a type of protein found in many different types of tissue, such as skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage (which covers the surface of joints). Without vitamin C, collagen can't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down.
Scurvy was common in sailors, pirates and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored (subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains) and some soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods which led to deficiency of vitamin C in the body.",No Symptoms.,"Scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C in diet. There are usually other contributing factors, such as:

Swine Flu,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/respiratory-tract/swine-flu,"Swine flu also known as swine influenza or Pandemic Influenza is a respiratory disease. It is caused by virus called H1N1 virus (introduced in 2009). This virus infects the wind pipe (respiratory tract) of pigs and later it gets transmitted to human beings. It results in nasal secretions,cough, decreased appetite, and restless behavior.
Swine flu was a relatively new strain of influenza virus (flu) that was responsible for a flu pandemic during 2009-2010. Swine flu viruses may mutate (change) so that they are easily transmissible among humans.
On 10 August 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the swine flu pandemic was officially over. However, this does not mean that swine flu has been completely eliminated. The H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic is now a regular flu virus and continues to circulate seasonally worldwide.","Swine flu has an incubation period (the time taken for the symptoms to appear) of 1-4 days.

Swine flu can spread to others up to about 6 feet away. The flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouth or nose of people who are nearby, which can be possibly inhaled into the lungs. In some cases, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it.",Swine flu can be diagnosed clinically by the patient's history and their symptoms. The diagnosis may further confirmed in the laboratory through a technique called RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction).,"Two antiviral agents are helpful in preventing or reducing the effects of swine flu. They are zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Both are also used to prevent or reduce influenza A and B symptoms.

Syphilis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/syphilis,"Syphilis is sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. This disease can be passed to another person through kissing or close physical contact. The infected person is often unaware of the disease and unknowingly passes it on to his or her sexual partner.
The sexual behaviour that spreads syphilis can also spread other Sexually transmitted diseases(STD's) likegonorrhea, HIVs. 

Stages of disease
The symptoms of syphilis develop in three stages, described below.

Stage 1 (Primary syphilis) – Symptoms of syphilis begin with a painless but highly infectious sore on the genitals or sometimes around the mouth. If somebody else comes into close contact with the sore, typically during sexual contact, they can also become infected. The sore lasts two to six weeks before disappearing.
Stage 2 (Secondary syphilis) – Secondary symptoms, such as a skin rash and sore throat develop. These symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, after which person may experience a latent (hidden) phase with no symptoms, which can last for years. After this, syphilis can progress to its third, most dangerous stage.
Stage 3 (Tertiary syphilis) – Around a third of people who are not treated for syphilis will develop tertiary syphilis. At this stage, it can cause serious damage to the body.","The symptoms of syphilis are the same for men and women. Also symptoms are mild and thus can be difficult to recognize.
The symptoms develop in three stages:

Primary syphilis
Secondary syphilis
Tertiary syphilis

Primary syphilis
The initial symptoms of syphilis can appear any time from 10 days to three months after one have been exposed to the infection.
The most common symptom is the appearance of a small, painless sore or ulcer (calledchancre). The sore will appear on the part of body where the infection was transmitted, typically the penis, vagina, anus, rectum, tongue or lips. Most people only have one sore, but some people can have more.
The sores are painless and may be overlooked, so the condition can be spread without realizing that have an infection.
The sore will then disappear within two to six weeks and, if the condition is not treated, syphilis will move into its second stage.
Secondary syphilis
The symptoms of secondary syphilis will begin a few weeks after the disappearance of the sore.
Common symptoms include:

A non-itchy skin rash appearing anywhere on the body, but commonly on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet
Tiredness
Headaches
Swollen lymph glands

Less common symptoms include:

Fever
Weight loss
Patchy hair loss
Joint pains

These symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, or come and go over a period of months.
Latent phase
Syphilis will then move into its latent (hidden) phase, where one will experience no symptoms, even though person remains infected. Latent syphilis can still be passed on during the first year of this stage of the condition, usually through sexual or close physical contact. However, after a couple of years, one cannot pass the infection to others, even though he/she remain infected.
The latent stage can continue for many years (even decades) after person has first become infected.
Without treatment, there is a risk that latent syphilis will move on to the most dangerous stage – tertiary syphilis.
Tertiary syphilis
The symptoms of tertiary syphilis can begin years or even decades after initial infection. Around a third of people who are not treated for syphilis develop serious symptoms at this stage.
The symptoms of tertiary syphilis will depend on what part of the body the infection spreads to. For example, it may affect the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, bones, skin or blood vessels, potentially causing any of the following symptoms:

Stroke
Dementia
Loss of co-ordination
Numbness
Paralysis
Blindness
Deafness
Heart disease
Skin rashes
At this stage, syphilis can be dangerous enough to cause death.","Syphilis is caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum.
The bacteria can enter one's body if he/she have close contact with an infected sore, normally during vaginal, anal or oral sex or by sharing sex toys.","Physical examination:
The doctor will examine genitals. For men, it involves examining the penis, foreskin and urethra (the hole at the end of the penis where urine comes out). For women, it involves an internal examination of the vagina. Both men and women may also have their anus examined.
Blood tests:
If one is infected with syphilis, then his/ her body produces antibodies (proteins released as part of immune response) against the syphilis bacteria.
Therefore, one way to determine whether one have syphilis is to have a sample of blood tested for the presence of these antibodies.
A positive result (antibodies present) indicates that one can either have the infection or used to have it (because the antibodies can remain in the body for years, even after a previous infection was successfully treated).
A negative result does not necessarily mean that one does not have syphilis as the antibodies may not be detectable for three months after infection. Person may be advised to repeat the test in three months time.
Every pregnant woman should have a blood test for syphilis as the infection can kill unborn or newborn babies. The blood test is usually done during an antenatal appointment at weeks 11–20 of pregnancy. If the test is positive, treatment for both the mother and baby can begin.
Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL):
The VDRL test is a screening test for syphilis. It measures substances, called antibodies, that body may produce if a person comes in contact with the bacteria that causes syphilis. This bacteria is called Treponema pallidum.
Swab test
If sores are present, a swab (like a cotton bud) will be used to take a small sample of fluid from the sore. This is then either looked at under a microscope in the clinic or sent to a laboratory for examination.","Penicillin, an antibiotic, injected into the muscle, is the best treatment for syphilis. If someone is allergic to penicillin, then healthcare provider may give another antibiotic to take by mouth.
In a later stage of disease, more doses of antibiotics will be needed."
Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/superior-limbic-keratoconjunctivitis,"Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is relatively an uncommon chronic disease of superior limbus/cornea, and superior bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva. It affects one or both eyes of middle-aged people, about half the patients have abnormal thyroid function (usually hyperthyroidism). About three percent of patients with thyroid eye disease develop SLK. Women are more commonly affected than men.
Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is believed to be due to blink-related trauma between the upper lid and the superior bulbar conjunctiva, precipitated in many cases by tear film insufficiency, and an excess of lax conjunctival tissue. With increased conjunctival movement, there is mechanical damage to the tarsal and bulbar conjunctival surfaces. It results in inflammatory response, leading to increased conjunctival oedema and redundancy, with the creation of a self-perpetuating cycle. It may be analogous to conjunctivochalasis (redundant excess fold of conjunctiva) affecting the lower bulbar conjunctiva.
Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis has similarities to mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis and a comparable clinical picture may be seen in:

Contact lens wearers.
Trauma to upper lid.
Upper eyelid surgery.

Between 1954 and 1963, reports by Braley and Alexander (Braley AE, Alexander RC. Superficial punctate keratitis. Arch Ophthalmol, 1953; 50(2):147-154), Thygesson and Kimura (Thygesson P, Kimura SJ: Chronic conjunctivitis. Trans Am Acad Ophthalmol Otolaryngol 1963; 67: 494-517) presented information about a new clinical entity associated with filamentary keratopathy.
Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis was first fully described by Frederick Theodore in 1963. (Theodore FH. Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis. Eye Ear Nose Throat Mon 1963; 42: 25-28.). He suggested the term Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis to describe a series of patients with the following presenting signs:

Inflammation of the superior tarsal conjunctiva,
Inflammation of the superior bulbar conjunctiva,
Fine punctate staining of the superior cornea, limbus, and the adjacent conjunctiva, and
Filaments on the superior limbus or upper fourth of the cornea.

SLK is probably under-diagnosed because symptoms are typically more severe than signs. The course can be prolonged over years although remission eventually occurs spontaneously.","The characteristic feature of the symptoms of SLK is its variability with intermittent remissions and exacerbations.
Patients may have ocular (eye) symptoms such as:

Burning sensation.
Redness.
Irritation (may be more prominent when patient looks upward).
Foreign body sensation.
Pain.
Itching.
Dry eye sensation.
Mild photophobia.
Frequent blinking.
Blepharospasm.
Mucoid discharge (less common).
Diminution of vision (rare).

      The symptoms are often intermittent.","Soft contact lens wear may be associated with features like SLK. It may be attributable to preservatives especially thiomersal. Removal of lens or preservatives is usually curative.
There have been many theories about the aetiology of SLK, but still some uncertainty remains till date.
Possible aetiological theories:
Mechanical trauma:
Mechanical trauma is the most popularly assumed theory as aetiology of SLK.
There is constant abnormal movement of the superior bulbar conjunctiva during blinking due to abnormal interaction of the superior tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva. The laxity of bulbar conjunctiva because of congenital origin or due to ageing, predisposes it to get repeatedly traumatised by upper lid as the lid is opened or closed. This abnormality may be due to tight apposition of tarsal conjunctiva against the globe in the setting of:

Thyroid eye disease e.g. endocrine exophthalmos (Some believe that when thyroid exophthalmos leads to SLK, it is of mechanical aetiology, since SLK disappears on control of endocrine exophthalmos. The upper eyelid is tensely applied against the upper bulbar conjunctiva and cornea because of thyroid abnormality,
Scarring of the superior tarsal conjunctiva,
Inflammation (Patients with chronic ocular inflammatory disease can develop a picture of SLK because of increased friction between the superior palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva. The chronically inflamed palpebral conjunctival surface could lead to a change in viscosity that prevents the normal maturation and replacement of bulbar conjunctival epithelium), or
Dryness of the eyes (patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca may have a drying effect between upper lid and bulbar conjunctiva and it increases the friction between the two).

This theory is supported by strong association of SLK with both thyroid dysfunction and dry eye disease.
There is high expression of transforming growth factor-beta 2 and tenascin, both are known to be affected by mechanical stress and injury.
The mechanical irritation induces abnormal mucous production and this abnormal mucous production is responsible for filament formation.
Biochemical abnormalities:
Alteration in expression of certain cytokeratins (CKs) is found in patients with SLK. There is decreased expression of a marker for non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium, CK13 along with increased expression of CK10, a marker for keratinisation, which correlates with disease severity. These suggest that an abnormality of differentiation in conjunctival epithelium plays a role in the disease.
Viral aetiology:
Some have suggested a viral cause, but cultures are found to be universally negative.
Bacterial aetiology:
In some studies, bacterial cultures have been shown to be positive, but mostly for normal ocular flora.
Autoimmune aetiology:
An autoimmune aetiology has also been proposed but this is also less likely due to:

The lack of immunoglobulin deposition (seen on direct immune-fluorescence),
Lack of increase in eosinophils, and
Variable response to topical steroids.

Hyperparathyroidism has also been reported in association with SLK.
A familial association has rarely been reported but is not the norm.","History of contact lens wear, and previous eyelid surgery or trauma should be obtained from the patient.
Even in untreated patients, the natural course of disease is one of episodic intermittent relapses and gradual improvement over several years, with eventual resolution. Most patients have bilateral affection, but asymmetric and unilateral disease does occur. The disease is roughly twice more common in females. It typically presents in fourth or fifth decades of life.
Patients with SLK present with non-specific ocular complaints. Symptoms are usually much more severe if the patient has corneal filaments. Often irritation is mild in the morning but it worsens thereafter. The symptoms can be vague and intermittent and often are mistaken for other ocular surface disease, such as dry eye or blepharitis. SLK patients are often misdiagnosed or are not diagnosed for many years, because superior conjunctiva is frequently not examined or clinical findings are often missed.
A diagnosis of SLK should only be made after a thorough patient history is obtained and physical examination is performed, since diagnosis is based primarily on the clinical findings.
Clinical examination:
It requires slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) examination by an eye-specialist.
Conjunctiva/Limbus:
It is advisable in suspected SLK patient to simultaneously elevate both upper lids and look at the superior conjunctiva. 


Conjunctival injection: Conjunctival injection is best examined with un-aided eye. The classical finding associated with SLK is superior bulbar conjunctival injection. The superior bulbar and limbal conjunctiva shows sectoral congestion in the form of radial band. Vital stains, such as rose Bengal or lissamine green are the most effective way to highlight abnormal conjunctiva. These stains are especially useful in cases where the conjunctival injection may be subtle. It is important to note that vital staining of the superior bulbar conjunctiva does not guarantee a diagnosis of SLK.
Limbal papillary hypertrophy: There may be limbal papillary hypertrophy.
Loss of superior limbal palisades: Normally present limbal palisades of Vogt may be lost superiorly.
Redundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva: Light downward pressure on the upper lid results in a fold of redundant conjunctiva crossing the upper limbus.


The thickening and hyperaemia of bulbar conjunctiva extends from upper limbus towards the insertion of the superior rectus muscle.

Superior conjunctival filaments.
Papillary reaction on superior tarsal conjunctiva: The papillae on superior tarsal conjunctiva are fine, small and numerous and often have a diffuse velvety appearance.
Petechial haemorrhages: Petechial haemorrhages may be present.
Keratinisation: Keratinisation may be demonstrated on biopsy or impression cytology of conjunctiva.


The inferior tarsal conjunctiva is typically normal.

Cornea:

Punctate epithelial keratitis: The superior cornea is involved in one-fourth to one-third cases and shows fine epithelial staining as punctate epithelial keratitis with fluorescein sodium or rose Bengal dye. Lesions of punctate epithelial keratitis are often separated from the limbus by a zone of normal epithelium.
Micropannus: Mild superior micropannus (superficial fibrovascular proliferation that extends 1-2 mm beyond normal vascular arcade) may be present in patients with long-standing disease.
Superior corneal filaments: The presence of filaments on the superior cornea should alert to the diagnosis of SLK, as this is the most common cause of the finding.
Corneal hypoesthesia: Corneal hypoesthesia is also sometimes present.
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca may be present in about half the cases of SLK.

Pseudoptosis: 

Inflammatory pseudoptosis: Inflammatory pseudoptosis (drooping of upper eyelid) may be seen in advanced cases.


Key to the diagnosis: 
Key to the diagnosis of SLK is the examination of superior bulbar conjunctiva by:

Elevation of upper lid: Elevate upper lid to examine superior bulbar conjunctiva. It is prudent to include lid elevation as part of the eye examination. The diagnosis of SLK is missed if the upper lid is not elevated.
Assessment of superior bulbar conjunctival injection: Superior bulbar conjunctival injection may be subtle. Subtle findings may go unrecognised, if superior conjunctiva is examined with the bio-microscope on high magnification only.

Histopathology:
Biopsy of superior bulbar conjunctiva generally shows keratinised epithelium as well as cellular infiltration (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). Along with this, it shows acanthosis, dyskeratosis and balloon degeneration of some nuclei. The demonstration of these features on diagnostic scrapings of the superior bulbar conjunctiva stained with Giemsa, helps in diagnosis of doubtful cases.
Electron microscopy shows abnormal distribution and aggregation of nuclear chromatin, filaments in nuclei, dense accumulations of cytoplasmic filaments that surround nuclei, and formation of multi-lobed nuclei or multi-nucleated inflammatory cells.
Palpebral conjunctiva is normal but polymorphonuclear cells are often present.
Wright (Wright P: Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis. Trans Ophthalmol Soc UK 92: 555, 1972) has stressed on the goblet cell population in SLK. Superior palpebral conjunctiva shows goblet cell hypertrophy, while bulbar conjunctiva which is thickened and keratinised shows very few goblet cells.
Diagnostic procedures:

Test for redundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva: The redundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva can be demonstrated by using a cotton-tipped applicator to pull the conjunctiva down over the superior cornea, under local anaesthesia. This is not possible with normal conjunctiva.
Impression cytology: Impressions of superior bulbar conjunctiva show severe squamous metaplasia, with a relative absence of goblet cells. Impressions of the superior tarsal conjunctiva show mild squamous metaplasia with inflammatory cells, while impressions of the inferior tarsal conjunctiva are essentially normal. Impression cytology aid in diagnosis, but is rarely necessary.
Confocal microscopy: Confocal microscopy is used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool when SLK is suspected clinically. Two variables studied were mean individual epithelial cell area (MIECA) and nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio. As compared to normal controls, SLK patients showed a significantly increased MIECA and a decreased N/C ratio. In addition, inflammatory cell density in SLK patients was increased, compared to controls.


Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis should be differentiated from the conditions such as:

Contact lens wearers: It is believed that contact lens preservative thiomersal exposure is responsible for contact lens induced changes like SLK. Only a small percentage of contact lens wearer shows keratinisation and filaments and a good number of patients had decreased vision and had more diffuse inflammation of the bulbar conjunctiva than is seen with SLK. The punctate epithelial keratitis is also more than what is observed in SLK. Contact lens-related change soon disappears with the cessation of their usage. SLK has got a very chronic course with periods of remissions and recurrences.
Allergic conjunctivitis.
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.
Trachoma.
Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy.
Episcleritis.
Floppy eyelid syndrome.
Viral conjunctivitis.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Medical therapy:
Initially, topical medical treatment should be attempted.

Artificial tears: Aggressive lubrication with artificial tears (preservative-free may be preferred) of the ocular surface may be done, either alone or in conjunction with occlusion of lacrimal punctum. It reduces friction between the tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva.
Acetylcysteine: Acetylcysteine breaks down filaments and provide lubrication to the ocular surface.
Rebamipide: Rebamipide, a mucin-inducing and secretion-promotive eye drop has shown promising results.
Autologous serum tears: Autologous serum tears may be more beneficial than artificial tears, providing objective and subjective improvement, but it requires more frequent instillation during the day.
Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids may produce symptomatic improvement in some cases, but the overall results have been variable. Corticosteroids may be best used in short intensive courses with rapid tapering, and should be reserved for severe cases.
Topical cyclosporine A: Topical cyclosporine A, an immune-modulator, may have very good success with resolution of symptoms in patients. It may be used as primary or adjunctive therapy, particularly in the presence of co-existing keratoconjunctivitis sicca. However, maintenance therapy is required for continued benefit.
Retinoic acid: Retinoic acid retards keratinisation.
Topical mast cell stabilisers: Topical mast cell stabilisers inhibit type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions and are used for long-term inhibition of inflammation (e.g. lodoxamide tromethamine and sodium cromoglycate).
Topical ketotifen fumarate: Topical ketotifen fumarate , a mast cell stabiliser and selective H1-blocking antihistamine (dual acting drug), addresses any inflammatory component and help in resolution of symptoms; but objective signs do not always improve.
Topical vitamin A: Topical vitamin A also helps in resolution of symptoms.
Supra-tarsal triamcinolone injection: When topical treatment is unsuccessful, injection of medication may break the inflammatory cycle. Supra-tarsal triamcinolone injection decrease symptoms and corneal/ conjunctival staining.
Large-diameter contact lenses: Chun and Kim used large-diameter contact lenses to decrease trauma to the superior bulbar conjunctiva, and hence, improved symptoms. In addition, injection of botulinum toxin A in pre-tarsal orbicularis muscle further improved results (Chun YS, Kim JC. Treatment of superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis with a large-diameter contact lens and botulium toxin A. Cornea 2009; 28: 752-758).

Surgical therapy:
Hallmark of SLK is redundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva. Different methods have been employed to attempt to tighten the redundant superior bulbar conjunctiva.
Tightening procedures for redundant superior bulbar conjunctiva:

Silver nitrate: Initial attempts with silver nitrate were effective, but severe ocular burns may result, especially when using a solid applicator. Silver nitrate application usually results in relief of symptoms for 4 to 6 weeks. Any residual remnant of silver nitrate is irrigated after a minute. It may be reapplied in cases with recurrence of disease.
Cryotherapy: Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy as a single application or repeated for recalcitrant cases is a safe and effective therapy, using the double freeze-thaw technique under topical anaesthesia.
Thermocautery: Use of thermocautery to tighten the superior bulbar conjunctiva may result in resolution of symptoms with increase in density of goblet cells.
Conjunctival fixation sutures: Conjunctival fixation sutures placed in superior fornix, results in complete resolution of symptoms as well.

Resection of the superior bulbar conjunctiva: Resection of the superior bulbar conjunctiva is used in cases where medical treatment and/or conjunctival tightening are not successful. This technique has been most successful, predictable and usually gives immediate as well as permanent relief of symptoms. This is the preferred and initial surgical treatment. Conjunctival resection alleviates symptoms and results in resolution of squamous metaplasia of conjunctiva. In rare cases, redundant conjunctiva can recur, necessitating further conjunctival resection or application of silver nitrate.
Temporary superior and/or inferior punctal occlusion: Temporary superior and/or inferior punctal occlusion may be done for concomitant lacrimal insufficiency, and it may be combined with instillation of artificial tears.
Management of associated thyroid dysfunction may improve SLK.

Prognosis:
In general, prognosis for superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is excellent. With increasing age, exacerbations tend to diminish in frequency with eventual total resolution, though symptoms may last for years."
Stroke,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/cardio-vascular/heart/stroke,"Stroke (also known as Brain Attack) occurs when blood supply to the brain is affected due to either blockage or leakage (or both blockage and leakage) of a blood vessel responsible for supplying or draining blood to and from the brain, thereby, causing brain damage leading to difficulty in movements, sensation, speaking, vision etc. or at times to death.
Types of stroke
Ischemic Stroke:In India about 70-75% of all strokes are ischemic, in which blood flow to the brain is blocked by blood clots or fatty deposits (also known as plaque) in blood vessel linings.
Hemorrhagic Stroke:It occurs when a blood vessel leaks in the brain. Blood accumulates and compresses the surrounding brain tissue. This is also called ‘Brain hemorrhage.
Intracerebral hemorrhage: It is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It occurs when an artery in the brain leaks, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage: It is bleeding in the area between the brain and its covering consisting of layers of tissue.
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a ""warning stroke"" or a ""mini-stroke"" that results in no lasting damage. Recognizing and treating TIAs immediately can reduce your risk of a major stroke.","Stroke can affect any movement, senses, speech, behavior, thoughts, memory, and emotions. The body may become paralyzed or weak.
The five most common symptoms of stroke are

Weakness or Numbness of the face, arm, or leg.
Confusion or trouble speaking or understanding others.
Difficulty in vision
Difficulty in walking or loss of balance or coordination.
Severe headache with unknown cause.","Presence of following risk factors place people at increased risk for developing stroke.
A.Non-modifiable

Family history
Old age
Male sex

B.Modifiable

High blood pressure
Diabetes
High cholesterol
Heart disease
Smoking (as it injures the blood vessels and speeds up the hardening of the arteries)
Consuming excessive alcohol (as it increases the blood pressure)
Low socioeconomic status","Strokes is primarily a clinical diagnosis, supported by brain imaging.
CT scans and MRI
Two common methods used for brain imaging are a computer tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.
A CT scan is like an X-ray, but uses multiple images to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional (3D) picture of the brain.
An MRI scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a detailed picture of the inside of the body.
Swallowing test:
A swallow test is essential for a person who has had a stroke. When a person cannot swallow properly, there is a risk that food and drink may get into the windpipe and then into the lungs (called aspiration), which can lead to chest infections and pneumonia.
Certain other tests carried out generally to diagnose stroke are as follows: Ultrasound (carotid ultrasonography)
An ultrasound scan uses high frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of the body. Doctor may use a wand-like probe (transducer) to send high-frequency sound waves into neck. These pass through the tissue, creating images on a screen that will show if there is any narrowing or clotting in the arteries leading to brain.
This type of ultrasound scan is sometimes also known as a ""Doppler Scan"" or a ""Duplex Scan"".
Brain Angiography
This is done to take images of the blood vessels of the brain. This can be done using CT (CT angiography), MRA (MR angiography) or injecting dye called catheter angiography.
This gives a more detailed view of arteries than can be obtained using ultrasound, CT angiography or MR angiography.
Echocardiogram
In some cases an echocardiogram may be used to produce images of the heart using an ultrasound probe placed on the chest (transthoracic echocardiogram). In addition, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) may also be used. This involves an ultrasonic probe which is passed down the food pipe (esophagus), usually under sedation. Because it's directly behind the heart, it produces a clear image of blood clots and other abnormalities that may not get picked up by the transthoracic echocardiogram.","All patients need good supportive care in a stroke unit, looked after by physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, Speech therapists, Occupational therapists with help from Radiologists, Neurosurgeons and others with interest in stroke.
Ischemic stroke
Blockage of a blood vessel, the root cause of ischemic stroke, can be cleared by injection of ‘clot-busters’ like t-PA into the patient’s forearm veins, but this is successful only in one third of patients who receive this injection within three hours of start of stroke. ‘Blood thinner’ (like aspirin) and treatment in stroke unit can be used in most patients. Some patients develop life-threatening swelling of the brain, and require surgery (called hemi craniectomy) to save their lives. In well equipped centres, clots can be mechanically removed with a device from inside of the arteries after angiography. Besides these, risk factors, fever, high blood pressure and high pressure within the head need to be brought under control.
Brain Haemorrhage Intra-cerebral haemorrhage
Leakage of the vessels stops soon on its own because blood clot seals the puncture site, but in one-third patients some leakage continues for 24 hours. Control of blood pressure is important to prevent continued leakage. Many patients require surgery for removal of the large blood clot causing life-threatening increase in pressure inside the skull. Rest of the treatment is similar to that of ischemic stroke.
Subarachnoid haemorrhage
Often, this is due to a sac like bulge from a blood vessel (called an aneurysm), which has a tendency of life-threatening re-bleeding, which requires surgery or angiography with coiling to prevent re-bleeding.

Patient should be closely monitored for signs of increased pressure on the brain, such as restlessness, confusion, difficulty in following commands, and headache. Other measures should be taken to keep the patient away from straining due to excessive coughing, vomiting, lifting weights and straining at stool.
In some cases, medicines may be given to control blood pressure, brain swelling, blood sugar levels, fever and seizures.
Surgery, if needed, may include surgical removal of blood clot, also aneurysm clipping, coil embolization and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) repair."
Scrub Typhus,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/scrub-typhus,"Scrub typhus
Introduction-
Scrub typhus is an acute, febrile, infectious illness that is caused by Orientia (formerly Rickettsia) tsutsugamushi. It is also known as tsutsugamushi disease or Chigger borne typhus. It is a zoonotic disease, transmitted by arthropod vector trombiculid mite. Humans are accidental hosts in this disease.
Scrub typhus is prevalent in many parts of India. There have been outbreaks in areas located in the sub-Himalayan belt, from Jammu to Nagaland. Outbreaks were also reported from Rajasthan. There were reports of scrub typhus outbreaks in Himanchal Pradesh, Sikkim and Darjeeling (West Bengal) during 2003-2004 and 2007. Outbreak occurs more frequently during the rainy season however in southern India outbreaks are reported during the cooler months of the year. Scrub typhus is a reemerging infectious disease in India.","A Papule develops at the site of bite. Bites are often found on the groin, axillae, genitalia or neck. The papule ulcerates and eventually heals with development of a black eschar.
Onset is acute with chills and fever (1040-1050 F), severe headache, infection of the mucous membrane lining the eyes (the conjunctiva), and swelling of the lymph nodes.
Approximately one week later, a spotted and then maculopapular rash appears first on the trunk and then on the extremities and blenches within a few days.
Symptoms generally disappear after two weeks even without treatment.
Complications are interstitial pneumonia (30 to 65% of cases), meningoencephalitis and myocarditis. In severe cases with pneumonia and myocarditis, the mortality rate may reach 30%.","Scrub typhus is caused by a bacterium called Orientia tsutsugamushi. Infection is transmitted by the mite Leptotrombidium deliense.
Human beings are infected when they walk into the mite islands (areas in the soil where the microecosystem is favourable for mites) and are bitten by the mite larvae (chiggers). The mite feeds on the serum of warm blooded animals only once during its cycle of development, and adult mites do not feed on man. The microbes are transmitted through ovarian transmission (certain arthropod vectors transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod) in mites.
The larval stage serves both as a reservoir and vector for infecting humans and rodents.
The incubation period of scrub typhus is about 5 to 20 days (mean, 10-12 days) after the initial bite.","Scrub typhus commonly presents as an undifferentiated fever that requires laboratory confirmation for the diagnosis,
Blood test- may reveal early lymphopenia with late lymphocytosis and Thrombocytopenia
Urine test- Albuminuria
Scrub typhus may be diagnosed in the laboratory by:
(i) Isolation of the organism
(ii) Serology
(iii) Molecular diagnosis (PCR)
Several serological tests available for the diagnosis are Weil-Felix Test (WFT), Indirect Immunoflourescent test (IIF), Enzyme linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA)","Scrub typhus is treated with antibiotics. Treatment to be given will depend on the age of patient, pregnancy status of female patient.
For further details consult the physician."
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/reproductive-system/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that spread primarily through person-to-person sexual contact. STIs are of public health concern not only because of their high prevalence worldwide, but also because of their potential to cause serious and permanent complications in infected people who are not treated in a timely and effective way. These complications and sequelae include infertility, fetal wastage, ectopic pregnancy, anogenital cancer and premature death, as well as neonatal and infant infections. In addition STIs are known to facilitate human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).
There are more than 30 different sexually transmissible bacteria, viruses and parasites. The most common conditions they cause are gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, trichomoniasis, chancroid, genital herpes, genital warts, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis B infection.
Several STIs, particularly HIV and syphilis, can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth, and through blood products and tissue transfer.
According to World Health Organization (WHO) more than 1 million people acquire a sexually transmitted infection (STI) every day globally. WHO estimates that 500 million new cases of one of four curable STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis) occur each year worldwide.
STIs/RTIs (reproductive tract infections) are an important public health problem in India. A community based STI/RTI prevalence study conducted during 2002-03 by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has shown that 6% of the adult population in India has one or more STI/RTI. This amounts to occurrence of about 30-35 million episodes of STI/RTI every year in the country.
A large proportion of new STIs occur amongst adolescents and young adults who may not be aware that they are infected, which can have a negative impact upon their future sexual and reproductive health.","The majority of STIs are present without symptoms. A person can have an STI without having obvious symptoms of disease. Therefore, the term “sexually transmitted infection” a broader term than “sexually transmitted disease” (STD) is preferred.
Common symptoms of STDs include –

Unusual discharge from the penis or vagina
Sores or warts on the genital area
Painful or frequent urination
Itching and redness in the genital area
Blisters or sores in or around the mouth
Abnormal vaginal odour
Anal itching, soreness, or bleeding
Dysparuenia
Abdominal pain
Fever","STIs are caused by more than 30 different bacteria, viruses and parasites. The major STIs and their causes are:

Bacteria-Chlamydia trachomatis (disease-Chlamydia), neisseria gonorrhoeae (disease-Gonorrhea) and Treponema pallidum (disease-Syphilis)
Viruses-Human immunodeficiency virus(HIV/AIDS), herpes simplex virus (HSV) (disease- Genital herpes), human papilloma virus (HPV)(disease- Genital warts), hepatitis B virus (disease-Hepatitis), and cytomegalovirus
yeasts and protozoan parasites-Trichomonas vaginalis (disease-Trichomoniasis) , pubic lice (disease- Pediculosis pubis), Sarcoptes scabiei (disease-scabies)

Transmission of STIs-

STIs spread predominantly by sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex.
Some STIs may spread via skin-to-skin sexual contact and through non-sexual means such as blood products and tissue transfer.
Many STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, hepatitis B, HIV, HPV, HSV-2 and syphilis) can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth.

Factors which increase the risk of transmission-
Occurrence of STI depends on many factors, both biological and behavioural.
Biological factors- Certain biological factors influence the transmission of STIs. They are age, sex, immune status of the host and the virulence of the organism.
Age- women become infected at a younger age than men.
Sex- women can be more easily infected than men.
Immune status- The immune status of the host and virulence of the infective agent affect transmission of STIs. Certain STIs increase the risk of transmission of HIV and which in turn increases the transmission of some STIs and complications of STIs by weakening the immune system.
Behavioural factors: Many behavioural factors may affect the chance of getting an STI. Such behaviours are known as ""risky behaviours”, include the following-

changing sexual partners frequently;
having more than one sexual partner;
having sex with casual partners, sex workers or their clients;
having unprotected sex when either partner has an infection;
having had an STI in the last year

Social factors: A number of social factors link sex and behavioural issues and may affect a person’s risk of getting an STI.
Other personal behaviours including skin piercing, use of unsterile needles to give injections or tattoos, use of alcohol may be associated with increased risk of STIs,
Population groups which are particularly vulnerable:

sexually active teenage girls;
sex workers and their clients;
men or women who have multiple sexual partners;
men or women whose jobs separate them from their regular sex partners for long periods of time, such as long-distance drivers, soldiers and migrant workers;
Men having sex with men including transgender;
Street children, prison inmates.","Accurate diagnostic tests for STIs are widely used in high-income countries. These are especially useful for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infections.
However, in low- and middle-income countries, diagnostic tests are largely unavailable. Where testing is available, it is often expensive and geographically inaccessible; and patients often need to wait a long time (or need to return) to receive results. As a result, follow up can be difficult and care or treatment can be incomplete.
The only inexpensive, rapid blood test currently available for an STI is for syphilis. This test is already used in testing of syphilis in pregnant women during antenatal care.
Several rapid tests for other STIs are under development and have the potential to improve STI diagnosis and treatment, especially in resource-limited settings.","STI case management is the care of a person with an STI-related syndrome or with a positive test for one or more STIs.
The components of case management include: history taking, clinical examination, correct diagnosis, early and effective treatment, advice on sexual behaviour, promotion and/or provision of condoms, partner notification and treatment, case reporting and clinical follow-up as appropriate. Thus, effective case management consists not only of antimicrobial therapy to obtain cure and reduce infectivity, but also comprehensive consideration and care of the patient’s reproductive health.STI case management consists of:
(a) Syndromic Management-WHO has recommended syndromic management, which is based on the identification of consistent groups of symptoms and easily recognized signs (syndromes) to guide treatment, without the use of laboratory tests.
This approach allows health workers to diagnose a specific infection on the basis of observed syndromes. Syndromic management is simple, assures rapid, same-day treatment, and avoids expensive or unavailable diagnostic tests. However, this approach misses the majority of STIs that do not demonstrate any syndromes. Flowcharts are used for the management of each syndrome provided as “National Guidelines on Prevention, Management and Control of Reproductive Tract Infections and Sexually Transmitted Infections” 2014 by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India*. These national standardized treatment protocols for STIs help to ensure that all patients receive adequate treatment at all levels of health care services.
Effective treatment is currently available for several STIs.
• Three bacterial STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis) and one parasitic STI (trichomoniasis) are generally curable with existing, effective single dose regimens of antibiotics.
• For herpes and HIV, antiviral drugs are available that can modulate the course of the disease, though they cannot cure the disease.
• For hepatitis B, immune system modulators (interferon) and antiviral medications can help to fight the virus and slow damage to the liver.
(b) Education and Counselling- Counselling is defined here as an interactive confidential process in which a care provider helps a patient to discuss on issues associated with STIs and to explore possible lines of action. Issues that should be addressed in a counselling session include:

Educate the patient on his/her present STI and how it was acquired. Inform the patient that bacterial STIs are curable, viral STIs may recur, and the effects of not taking treatment properly. (Patients with recurrent genital herpes and recurrent vulvovaginitis are usually very distressed and need repeated counselling sessions).
Inform the partner(s) or spouse about the STI diagnosis.
Assess the patient’s risk for HIV and deciding whether or not to undergo testing for HIV.
Help the patient to learn about complications of STIs, such as infertility and congenital syphilis. 
Inform the patient on how to deal with an incurable STI, such as herpes genitalis or genital warts, which may be transmitted to the partner (s) or spouse.
Educate the patient on how to prevent future infections, including strategies for discussing and introducing condom use with the partner (s) or spouse.
Tell the patient about confidentiality, disclosure and the risk of violence or stigmatizing reactions from spouse, partner(s), family or friends and ways to overcome these.
Enable patients to take control of their own life and their responsibilities for disease prevention.

(c) Manage and treat partner -Management of sexual partners is based on knowledge of the index patient’s diagnosis (syndromic or specific). The following three strategies can be adopted for the treatment of partners:

Offer immediate epidemiological treatment (treatment based solely on the diagnosis of the index patient) without any laboratory investigation.
Offer immediate epidemiological treatment, but obtain specimens for subsequent laboratory confirmation.
Delay treatment until the results of definitive laboratory tests are available.

WHO recommends that epidemiological treatment (with the same treatment regimen used for the index patient) should be given to all sexual partners.
(d) Offer HIV Counselling and testing- A consultation for an STI is a unique opportunity to provide education on the prevention of HIV and STIs to people who, by definition, are at risk for these infections.
(e) Follow up-Appropriate clinical follow up is a part of comprehensive case management of STI. The follow up schedules are prescribed for each syndrome in the respective flow charts (as provided by GOI*). Patients should be advised to return if their symptoms get worse or persist after the prescribed period of therapy."
Shaken Baby Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/shaken-baby-syndrome,"Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is a violent act of one form of child abuse, a non-accidental traumatic brain injury, which can cause neurologic, cognitive and other functional deficits. Retinal findings may be the only manifestation of SBS and then an eye specialist may initially recognise it. Cases should be thoroughly reviewed and prevention strategies developed to prevent further incidents. SBS has important medico-legal implications since the safety of child may be at stake.
Maltreatment of children, including non-accidental trauma, is problematic for children, families and care providers. Death may result in most serious cases due to maltreatment. SBS victims can present with wide range of symptoms, from generalised flu- like symptoms to unresponsiveness with risk of imminent death.
Signs of maltreatment may not be obvious. Detecting maltreatment requires careful attention of health care providers to ensure safety and care of victim, appropriate counselling of family, reporting of incidents to law enforcing agencies and prevention of repeat occurrences.
In 1946, Caffey described ‘whiplash shaken-baby syndrome’, a cluster of infantile subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhage, traction-type metaphyseal (wide portion or growth plate between epiphysis and narrow diaphysis) fracture, and retinal haemorrhage. This cluster of injuries was noted in many infants despite the lack of any external surface injury. Injuries were attributed to the developmental differences in infants head as compared with adults. Head comprises 25% of the total body weight in infants as compared to about 10% of total body weight in adults. In addition, infants have weak neck muscles, higher water content in brain matter and poor motor control rendering them more susceptible to injury through violent shaking.","SBS victims may present with a wide variety of symptoms ranging from very mild to most critical of states.
Less severe cases:
Infant may present with parents or caretaker giving history of:-
- Poor feeding.
- Vomiting.
- Lethargy.
- Irritability.
- Hypothermia or chills.
- Generalised failure to thrive.
- Increased sleeping.
- Failure to smile.

Symptoms may persist for days to weeks and are apparent to parent or caretaker as problematic and abnormal. However, care may or may not be sought. These fairly nonspecific features may be attributed to other causes of origin such as viral illness or colic and may resolve without the root-cause being even discovered.
More severe cases:
Infant may exhibit more life-threatening signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment. Following a violent shaking, immediate medical attention may or may not be sought. Parent or caretaker may put infant to bed anticipating that the child will recover. This may lead to missed opportunity for an early intervention.
Infant on presentation may show:-
- Difficulty in breathing including apnoea.
- Decreased level of consciousness.
- Seizures.
- Bradycardia.
- Bulging fontanelles (space where two sutures join to form a membrane covered soft spot in incompletely ossified skull) suggestive of raised intracranial pressure.
- Possible complete cardiovascular collapse requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).","Head injuries are the chief cause of traumatic death and leading cause of fatalities due to child abuse. Serious injuries in infants, notably those causing death, are rarely accidental unless there is a clear cause for the injuries, such as road traffic accident due to motor vehicle.
The majority of all cases of SBS are limited to children under three years of age. Shaking is generally attributed to the perpetrators level of tension and frustration, often generated by infants crying or irritability.
Risk factors for non-accidental injuries include:
- Young parents.
- Unstable family environment.
- Low socioeconomic status.
- Unrealistic child-rearing expectations.
- Infant prematurity or disability.
- Rigid attitudes and impulsivity.
- Feelings of inadequacy, isolation or depression.
- Negative childhood experiences including neglect or abuse.
- Crying of the infant or child may also play a role.

Additionally, parents or caretakers who have been involved in substance abuse and/or domestic violence may be at a higher risk for inflicting SBS. General demonstration of violence on television, radio and video games may also have a strong correlation with child abuse.

Parents may not be aware of the basic needs and normal development of their infant. Parents may have unrealistic expectations of the infant and a poor understanding of infant’s developmental level and abilities. According to Fulton, infants can spend up to 20% of their waking time crying. To the parents and caretakers, infant may seem inconsolable, and frustration can quickly build up. This may lead to physical shaking of infant in an attempt to calm the baby. Episodes of shaking are directly proportional to the degree of frustration felt by the parent or caretaker, and they become the perpetrators of abuse resulting in child fatality.

Risk factors of caretakers including babysitters, contributing to SBS, include their immaturity, young age and lack of life experience.

Situations suggesting possibility of abuse are:
- Infant presenting with a history that is not plausible or consistent.
- Presence of new adult partner in home.
- Delay in seeking medical attention.
- Absence of primary caretaker at the onset of injury or illness.
- Previous history or suspicion of abuse.
- Unexplained changes in neurological status.
- Unexplained shock and/ or cardiovascular collapse.
- Physical evidence of multiple injuries at varying stages of healing.
During shaking episode, rotational forces and differential movement of the brain in relation to surrounding tissues can tear the bridging vessels resulting in subdural haematoma. In addition, rotational forces lead to strains on the nerve axons in brain resulting in diffuse axonal injury. Head trauma seems to trigger a chain of events that result in cerebral hypoxia, cerebral oedema, raised intracranial pressure and vaso-occlusion. Displacing effect of subdural haematoma may lead to further ischaemia. In general, intracranial injury in absence of any significant accidental trauma is a significant indicator of inflicted injury.
Cervical spine epidural haematoma may take place in a significant proportion of abused infants, in addition to focal axonal injury of lower brainstem, superior spinal cord and spinal nerve roots. It is also thought that the effect of stretching at cranio-cervical junction during violent shaking may lead to apnoea, which causes diffuse hypoxia.
Mechanism of injury resulting in retinal haemorrhage is not conclusively known. Several mechanisms for retinal haemorrhages have been postulated such as acceleration-deceleration forces which cause damage via vitreo-macular traction. Other possible mechanisms include blunt head trauma, increased intracranial pressure due to trauma, sudden rise in intraocular pressure, hypoxia, extravasation of subarachnoid blood or coagulopathies.
The number, location, size and character of retinal haemorrhages varies from case to case, however, more severe haemorrhage may be associated with more serious brain injury.","The onset of symptoms is useful both in understanding prognosis as well as determining a cause. Timing can best be established by the history, clinical course and results of diagnostic imaging studies. When accurate, the clinical history is the most precise means for establishing a timeline. Elapsed time from the onset of injury can be estimated through the breakdown of intracranial haemoglobin as seen on diagnostic radiological studies.
The basis for the diagnosis of inflicted injury is a physical examination that conflicts with the history provided.
Three categories are identified for parent or caretaker explanations of infant injuries:-
- First category: First category include explanations of the child not being well including general malaise, fever, nausea, vomiting, having a fall or being dropped.
- Second category: Second category include explanations such as dangerous use of household objects, including appliances and toys, rough play, or no explanation of the events leading to injury. Over the time, parent or caretaker may or may not offer an explanation and may have used the time to construct a fictitious reason.
- Third category: Third category admits of shaking the infant. Very few caretakers do admit shaking, however, when they do, they often cite a history of attempting to console the child or prevent from choking on an object. Two to three explanations or stories are not uncommon.
One of the hallmark presentations of SBS is lack of external injuries. This may lead to a missed diagnosis even in most severe of the cases. Lack of obvious trauma may falsely minimise healthcare provider suspicion of possible maltreatment. In the event, any external injury is noted, it should be fully documented.
Repeated physical examinations may reveal further signs of trauma.
Evidence of other injuries including non-specific bruises, rib fractures, fractures of long bones, abdominal injuries and retinal haemorrhages should be assessed and documented. Forensic photography can aid in clear and accurate documentation of injuries.
An accurate diagnosis of retinal haemorrhage is crucial for appropriate medical care and for legal reasons.
Clinical features:
- Ocular (eye) manifestations: A child with classic features of physical abuse should have detailed examination of eyes by an eye-specialist. A child may have signs such as:-
Periorbital trauma: Periorbital trauma like ecchymosis, lid oedema or orbital fractures.
Anterior segment trauma: Anterior segment trauma may show hyphaema (blood in anterior chamber of eye), iris prolapse, corneal laceration or cataract.
Posterior segment trauma: Posterior segment trauma may show vitreous haemorrhage, retinal haemorrhage, retinal detachment or avulsion of optic nerve. Macular retinoschisis (splitting of retina) may also occur.

It is somewhat controversial whether retinal haemorrhage in a child is a definitive sign of SBS. It is seen that large retinal haemorrhages are unusual in other forms of head injuries and are found in about 1% of cases with serious head trauma.

Retinal haemorrhages can be seen as early as 48 hours before any intracranial lesions can be found on CT scan or MRI of the brain.

Retinal haemorrhages are the cardinal manifestations of SBS which may be seen in 75-90% of cases. Classically, children have multilayered retinal haemorrhages i.e. pre-retinal, intra-retinal and sub-retinal. Retinal haemorrhages are too numerous to count and extend from posterior pole to the retinal periphery.

Shaking can lead to permanent vision impairment and may be even blindness in more severe cases.

There may be associated brain injury which may result in nystagmus (persistent, involuntary and repetitive to-and-fro movement of eyes), cortical (cortex of brain) blindness or cranial nerve palsies.

- Intracranial injury: The important diagnostic feature of SBS is the presence of intracranial injury in an infant. The most common injury is subdural haematoma. Other injuries may be epidural haematoma or subarachnoid haemorrhage.
- Traumatic brain injury (TBI): TBI occur when a sudden trauma, such as violent shaking, causes shearing injuries of the brain parenchyma. Clinical features of TBI can range from mild to severe, depending upon the extent of injury to the brain.
Mild signs are:-
-Headache.
-Lethargy.
-Dizziness.
-Confusion.
-Blurred vision.
-Changes in mood and memory.

Severe signs are:-
-Nausea and vomiting.
-Inability to arouse from sleep.
-Seizures.
-Dilatation of one or both pupils.
-Loss of coordination.
-Persistent crying.
-Refusal to nurse or eat.

- Bone fractures: Bone fractures can be found in half of all SBS cases, in spite of no apparent external injury. These fractures may take place anywhere in the body. Most common type of bony injury in SBS is the metaphyseal chip fracture. These fractures occur at the growth plate of bone due to uncontrolled swinging of extremities during shaking period. There may be rib fractures as well. In fatal cases, ribs are the most common site for fractures. In addition, whenever an infant presents with rib fractures, it is most often as a result of physical abuse. Posterior rib fractures are often due to antero-posterior thoracic compression such as that associated with a shaking episode.
Diagnostic procedures:
- Radiological examination: Skeletal survey should include radiographs of hands, feet, long bones, skull, spine and ribs. This should be performed as soon as general condition of the child permits. Diagnostic yield of radiographs is further enhanced by follow-up skeletal survey conducted after two weeks.

- Scintigraphy: Scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine test which detects areas of increased or decreased bone metabolism, thus increase sensitivity of detecting rib fractures. Scintigraphy is of particular use if the child has to be discharged to a potentially unsafe environment, prior to two week follow up skeletal survey.

- Computed tomography (CT scan): CT scan has primary role in imaging evaluation of a child with TBI. CT scan can detect injuries requiring immediate attention. Initial CT scan should be performed without contrast and is the procedure of choice for demonstrating acute haemorrhage, including that involving subarachnoid space. CT scan should be repeated after a period of time or if there is rapid change in neurologic signs.


- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI optimizes detection and assessment of intracranial injury including parenchymal haemorrhage, contusions, oedema and shearing injuries. MRI is also sensitive for detecting significant spinal injury and any parenchymal haemorrhage. A posterior, intra-hemispheric subdural haematoma, in the absence of significant accidental trauma, is indicative of inflicted injury.

Elapsed time from the onset of injury can be estimated through the breakdown of intracranial haemoglobin as seen on diagnostic radiological studies such as CT scan and MRI.
(http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/344973-overview#a2).

- Spinal tap: If a spinal tap yields bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a fluid which is xanthochromic (yellowish appearance of CSF) should arouse suspicion that the cerebral trauma may be several hours old and the blood in CSF is not from traumatic spinal tap.

Laboratory studies for SBS are nonspecific and are not diagnostic. Leukocytosis is seen in about 50% of cases. Serum chemistry findings are usually normal, but it may reveal evidence of acidosis.

SBS should be distinguished from conditions like:
- Accidental head trauma.
- Blunt ocular trauma.
- Purtscher’s retinopathy: Purtscher’s retinopathy is a haemorrhagic and vaso-occlusive vasculopathy which shows multiple white retinal patches and retinal haemorrhages associated with severe visual loss. It may be associated with traumatic injury, primarily blunt thoracic trauma and head trauma, and numerous non-traumatic diseases.
- Terson syndrome: Terson syndrome is the association of intra-retinal haemorrhage with subarachnoid haemorrhage.
- Anaemia.
- Coagulopathy.
- Normal birth of baby: After normal vaginal delivery, retinal haemorrhages are occasionally seen without any intracranial lesions. Haemorrhages appear to be related to obstetrical and perinatal changes. These can occur with any type of delivery but are more common with normal vaginal or vacuum assisted deliveries.","Management should be strictly under medical supervision.
The identification, investigation, management and prevention of SBS require a multidisciplinary approach. There is a need for united effort among healthcare, child welfare, law enforcement, social services, education professionals and community at large.
All individuals and groups involved with detection, management and prevention should be provided knowledge of SBS. Creative preventive interventions, education regarding hazards of shaking and the development of appropriate coping skills can be disseminated to the community. The future well-being of children who have been victim to, or have the potential to become a victim of SBS, rests with the ability to work collectively.
Final outcome from inflicted injury is generally worse than accidental injury. Therefore, one must have a heightened index of suspicion for recognising patterns of injury of SBS. Although cause of injury may vary greatly, there are no differences in actual management of non-accidental versus accidental cases.
In suspected SBS, health providers should notify child protective services and law enforcement officials. Prompt notification facilitates a thorough investigation before the medical history becomes blurred by time. Early involvement of child protective services is also important for protection of other children under the custody of same caretakers.
Medical care:
In addition to diagnostic team having specialists from various disciplines, treatment team should have health care practitioners who can resuscitate and stabilise the victim immediately. Follow-up examination should also be carried out by the same treatment team.
Supportive medical care is the mainstay of management in SBS:
- Blood pressure and vital signs should be maintained.
- Resuscitate the child, if required.
- Manage raised intracranial pressure, if present.
- Some children require treatment for amblyopia or strabismus due to visual defect developing after SBS.
- Antiepileptic medication may be indicated for seizures.
- Physiotherapy and occupational therapy may be helpful after neurological injury.
- Speech therapy might be of use for patients in whom speech and/or language is affected.

Surgical care:
- Surgical vitrectomy may be needed rarely for non resolving vitreous haemorrhage.
- Surgery may be needed for subdural haematoma or retinal detachment."
Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/seasonal-allergic-conjunctivitis,"Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) or ‘hay fever eyes’ is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to seasonal allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. Intermittent (less than 4 weeks in duration) seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and persistent (more than 4 weeks in duration) perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), makes up a large number of ocular (eye) allergy cases. Most cases of SAC occur during the spring and autumn when the level of seasonal allergens (i.e. pollens) is high. In contrast, PAC generally occurs in response to environmental allergens (dust mites and animal dander) that are present throughout the year and is generally chronic. Majority of PAC and SAC affect both young and middle-aged people of both sexes.
SAC and PAC are the common and sub-acute forms of ocular allergy, usually accompanied by seasonal allergic rhinitis. Although SAC and PAC are relatively mild conditions, rarely causing permanent visual impairment, their effects on the quality of life can be profound, with significant morbidity.
The seasonal incidence of SAC is closely related to the cycles of released plant-derived airborne allergens, or aeroallergens. The allergens that produce SAC vary from one geographic area to another, but tree, grass and ragweed pollens are the most common encountered allergens.
Atopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction) is a genetically determined predisposition to hypersensitivity reactions upon exposure to specific environmental allergens/antigens. It includes allergic conjunctivitis, as well as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma and eczema. Allergic conjunctivitis is a type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction, being mediated by degranulation of mast cells (MCs) in response to the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE). There is evidence suggestive of an element of type IV hypersensitivity in some form.
Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). In seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement is rare. In contrast, AKC and VKC are severe inflammatory diseases, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment.
SAC and PAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis, while AKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively.","Ocular symptoms associated with SAC may be:
- Ocular pruritus (itching).
- Redness of eyes.
- Watering or tearing (epiphora).
- Mucoid discharge.
- Burning.
- Stinging or pricking.
- Watery discharge.
- Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva).
- Photophobia (sensitivity to light).
- Swollen eyes.
-    Dryness of eyes.","Acute allergy is caused by IgE-mediated MC degranulation, whereas chronic allergies are also associated with continuous activation of MC but with predominance of mediators, such as eosinophils and T- helper2 (Th2) lymphocyte-generated cytokines.
Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is worse during spring and summer. The most frequent allergens are pollens from trees, weeds and grass, although the specific allergen varies in different geographic locations. Individuals with SAC have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time. In spring, the predominant airborne allergen is tree pollen; in summer, it is grass pollen; and in fall, it is weed pollen. Typically, persons with SAC are symptom-free in winter/cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of these allergens. In contrast, PAC causes symptoms throughout the year, generally worse in the autumn when exposure to animal dander, house dust mites and fungal allergens is highest. PAC is less common and tends to be milder than the seasonal form.
Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis can manifest itself through tear-film instability and symptoms of eye discomfort during the pollen season.
Pathophysiology:
Both SAC and PAC are type I (immediate) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, due to environmental airborne allergens, with the mast cell (MC) playing a central role. A reaction occurs when a sensitised individual is exposed to a particular antigen. IgE has strong affinity for MCs triggering its degranulation. The number of MCs present within conjunctival stroma may be increased up to 60% in patients with SAC as compared to normal.
An allergen reacts with specific IgE antibodies bound to a sensitised MC, triggering cross-linkage of the IgE molecules and an influx of calcium ions into the MC. This causes the MC to degranulate and release preformed inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, which causes the signs and symptoms associated with the early-phase response in sensitised individuals.
There are two components of MC activation. The first is the release of pre-formed mediators, including histamine. The second is the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the subsequent metabolic cascade, resulting in production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
Histamine binds to Histamine1(H1) receptors and results in primary allergic symptoms of itching, burning, and stinging sensation and tearing, while binding to the Histamine2(H2) receptor releases leukotrienes and prostaglandins, stimulating mucus production and also increasing vascular permeability. This early phase response is immediate and lasts clinically for about 20-30 minutes. (http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/histamine/jm/receptors.htm).
MC degranulation also initiates a series of cellular and extracellular events, which lead to the late-phase response (production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes). MCs also release cytokines and chemotactic factors which induce the production of IgE from B lymphocytes (B cells), enhance the production of T helper lymphocytes, attract eosinophils and activate vascular endothelial corneal and conjunctival cells to release chemokines and adhesion molecules. Chemokines and adhesion molecules mediate the infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and T helper lymphocytes to the site of inflammation.
Degranulating eosinophils release toxic proteins which have cytotoxic effects and further enhance MC degranulation. These products of eosinophils are toxic to the corneal epithelium and, if present chronically, may result in ulceration. The late phase response is characterised by an influx of multiple inflammatory cells.","Diagnosis of SAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist.
Important features of the history include a personal or family history of atopic disease such as:
- Allergic rhinitis.
- Bronchial asthma.
- Atopic dermatitis.
Signs and symptoms of SAC and PAC are essentially the same and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen. The difference relies on specific allergens to which patients are sensitive and the chronicity of exposure.
SAC remains self-limited without compromising cornea or ocular surface damage. SAC is usually bilateral, although it may be asymmetrical. If the allergic insult occurs with a particular allergen entering only one eye, ocular changes may exceptionally be unilateral. The symptoms and signs are recurrent, occurring rapidly following the exposure to seasonal allergens.
Individuals with SAC typically have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time, usually of short duration, that is, when the predominant airborne allergen is present. Typically, person with SAC are symptom-free during the winter months in cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of some allergens, such as pollen. The severity of symptoms varies depending on the type of allergen, its concentration, and time of exposure.
Dry eye facilitates allergen contact with the ocular surface since the capability of tears to ‘wash away’ the allergen is usually compromised.
The most significant symptom in SAC is itching. Patients usually complain of intense itching of the eyes, sometimes along with a burning sensation and tearing. Discharge is usually serous, clear and watery, but with a ropy characteristic.
Without itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is suspect. With intense itching, the diagnosis of SAC is very likely, but one should also consider ocular conditions like dry eye, toxic conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, blepharitis, and other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. In these other disorders, itching is usually mild and occasional.
Ocular symptoms of SAC may be associated with features of allergic rhinitis such as sneezing and nasal discharge.
Signs of SAC: 
Signs on slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) examination may be:
- Lid oedema.
- Mucoid discharge.
- Mild papillary reaction.
- Conjunctival hyperaemia.
- Chemosis may be apparent in the bulbar and lower tarsal conjunctiva, giving to it a ‘milky’ or pale pink appearance.
- Dramatic unilateral bulging of the conjunctiva, frequently described as the acute formation of a ‘bubble’ in the eye, mainly when patients rub their eyes. Conjunctiva balloons, due to intense and acute infiltration of cells and fluids, causing chemosis.
- Dellen (shallow saucer-shaped excavations in periphery of cornea) of cornea may form due to intense conjunctival chemosis and unstable tear film. Dellen may resolve with the resolution of chemosis.
- Punctate keratitis may be present rarely.
Diagnostic procedures:
Investigations are generally not required.
- Intra-dermal skin test: Intra-dermal skin test is the standard clinical test for the diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Cutaneous tests, such as the scratch, prick or patch, and more rarely, the intra-cutaneous injections, may be utilised to determine the antigens causing hypersensitivity. The prick test is the preferred method because it is more sensitive, less variable, and more comfortable to patients than the intra-cutaneous test.
    Normally, skin test for particular allergens is rarely needed.
- Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. However, eosinophils are observed in the most severe cases, but are generally present in the deep layers of the substantia propria of the conjunctiva. For this reason, the absence of eosinophils on conjunctival scrapings does not rule out the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Even the presence of one eosinophil or eosinophilic granules is consistent with a diagnosis of allergy. 
- Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Elevated IgE levels in serum (RAST, ELISA) and in tear fluid are present in almost all patients with SAC. Tear and serum levels of IgE may be helpful in diagnosis, monitoring the level of allergic activity and the response to therapeutic measures.
- Conjunctival provocation test (CPT): Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending pollen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of SAC. Conjunctival provocation tests are rarely necessary for the diagnosis of SAC and it has rather proven to be a reliable method to evaluate ocular therapeutics.
- Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as SAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features.
- Tear film mediators: Quantitative analysis of tear film inflammatory mediators is used as a disease marker and to understand immune mechanisms.

SAC should be differentiated from conditions like:
- Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or Dry eye syndrome: KCS may present with conjunctival congestion and ocular irritation but no chemosis and itching is mild. In KCS, conjunctival congestion and punctate keratopathy are seen typically in inter-palpebral area.
- Contact dermatitis.
- Toxic conjunctivitis.
- Blepharitis.
- Other forms of allergic conjunctivitis.
- Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.
- Bacterial conjunctivitis.
- Viral conjunctivitis: Early viral conjunctivitis may be differentiated from allergic conjunctivitis by history of chronicity and presence of pre-auricular lymphadenopathy.
- Occult foreign body: An occult foreign body beneath the upper lid may cause symptoms similar to allergic conjunctivitis. There is linear staining of cornea due to abrasion produced by foreign body.

Itching is a significant feature of SAC, but it is usually mild and occasional in other conditions.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
One important goal of treatment is to prevent transformation of SAC to a chronic inflammatory process.
General measures:
Management of SAC includes reducing the amount of allergen exposure.
- Avoid outside activities: Because SAC usually involves allergens, patient should avoid outside activities until late afternoon or after a heavy rain, when pollen levels are lower. SAC tends to be worse in warm, dry weather and to lessen with rain and cool temperatures. Patients should also keep windows in their home and car closed to lessen exposure to pollen.
    Pollen can also be transported indoors on people and pets. Hair and clothes should be washed after being outdoors.
- Wearing glasses or goggles: Wearing glasses or goggles can also serve as a barrier to allergens.
- Air purifiers: Air purifiers that use high-efficiency particulate arrestance or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration are more effective and safer (remove up to 99% of the material like dust mite faeces, all allergens, such as animal dander, dust, pollen, or cockroach faeces).
Supportive measures:
Supportive measures include:
- Cold compresses: Cold compresses decrease ocular inflammation.
- Saline solutions: Irrigation of ocular surface with saline solution facilitates removal of allergens, and thus achieves the primary principle of allergy management by minimising exposure of the ocular surface to allergens.
- Artificial tears: Preservative-free artificial tears may be used to wash or dilute allergens and inflammatory mediators away from the ocular surface. In addition, some types of artificial tears provide relief through the lubrication of the ocular surface. Ointments or time-released tear replacements, used at night, provide a longer-lasting measure, delivering ocular surface lubrication during sleep. These agents are used for mild SAC only since they neither treat the underlying allergic response nor modify the activity of any of the mediators of inflammation. Artificial tear solutions should be kept in refrigerator, since the use of cold drops produces vasoconstriction, ameliorating symptoms and signs.
- Avoidance of eye rubbing. 
Medical therapy:
It is important to note that in the treatment of acute or chronic forms of allergic eye diseases, patient compliance may not be ideal, giving the false impression of poor efficacy of medical therapy.
Medical therapy includes:
- Topical vasoconstrictors: Topical vasoconstrictors may provide short-term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. There is also some amelioration of ocular itching with the use of topical vasoconstrictors. Like artificial tears, topical vasoconstrictors do not reduce the allergic response, because they do not antagonise any of the mediators of allergic inflammation. However, prolonged use of vasoconstrictors may cause rebound conjunctival redness and inflammation (‘conjunctivitis medicamentosa’) (Spector S &amp; Raizman M (1994): Conjunctivitis medicamentosa. J Allergy Clin Immunol 94: 134–136.), and they are ineffective in severe ocular allergy. To minimise this potential side-effect, exposure to medicine should be limited through less frequent dosing or shorter treatment durations. Examples include naphazoline, and oxymetazoline.
- Topical antihistamine: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of SAC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. These medications do not affect other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which remain uninhibited. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.
- Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor), may provide short term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus.
- Systemic antihistamines: Systemic antihistamines may also relieve signs and symptoms of allergy. Oral antihistamines may be indicated for severe symptoms of allergy involving eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. Some, such as diphenhydramine, cause significant drowsiness and may be useful in aiding sleep.
- Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of SAC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.
- Topical mast cell stabilisers: Topical mast cell stabilisers decrease the degranulation of conjunctival MCs, preventing the release of histamine and other chemotactic factors. However, the drug does not relieve existing symptoms and has no role in the treatment of the acute phase of SAC; mast cell stabilisers should be used on a prophylactic basis. They need to be used long term (treatment effect usually requires continued use over 5-7 days) or in conjunction with other classes of medications, such as antihistamines. Examples are cromolyn sodium, Iodoxamide, nedocromil, and pemirolast.
- H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (Dual-acting agents): Dual-acting agents exert multiple pharmacological effects, such as histamine receptor antagonist action, stabilisation of MC degranulation and, subsequently, suppression of activation and infiltration of eosinophils. Examples are oloptadine, azelastine, epinastine and ketotifen. Drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines. 
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit production of prostaglandins (thus relieves itching) and have no role in blocking mediator such as leukotrienes. Example is ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac.
- Topical corticosteroids: Corticosteroid eye drops are very effective in treating SAC, but the numerous adverse effects, such as secondary infections, elevated intraocular pressure, and formation of cataract, make their use selective. Patients using corticosteroids should be closely monitored. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are broad and non-specific. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.
- Immuno-modulators: Immuno-modulators such as cyclosporine drops and tacrolimus ointment have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ocular allergy. Cyclosporine A is an immunosuppressant that acts by inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration by interfering with type IV allergic reactions in the conjunctiva. Tacrolimus acts mainly by inhibiting the action of T cells. Both agents are associated with fewer side effects and are preferred over chronic use of corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Immuno-modulatory agents are reserved for more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis (such as VKC and AKC) and have limited indications in cases of SAC.
- Allergen-specific immunotherapy: Allergen-specific immunotherapy is an effective treatment used to induce immunologic tolerance when the allergen is well known. The primary objectives of allergen-specific immunotherapy are to decrease the symptoms triggered by allergens and to prevent recurrence of the disease in the long term. It is indicated in patients who have evidence of specific IgE antibodies to clinically relevant allergens. Skin prick testing is the preferred method of testing for specific IgE antibodies and identification of allergen for the immunotherapy. Candidates for immunotherapy include those who:
(1) Have symptoms that are not well controlled by pharmacological therapy or avoidance measures.
(2) Require high doses of medication, multiple medications, or both to maintain control of their disease.
(3) Experience adverse effects of medications, or
(4) Wish to avoid the long-term use of pharmacological therapy.

Prognosis:
Prognosis of SAC is good despite significant discomfort and undesirable cosmetic appearance. Allergic conjunctivitis generally clears up readily. Although, allergic conjunctivitis may commonly reoccur, it rarely causes complications or visual loss."
Spheroidal Degeneration,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/spheroidal-degeneration,"Spheroidal degeneration (climatic droplet keratopathy, Bietti’s band-shaped nodular dystrophy, chronic actinic keratopathy or Labrador keratopathy) is a nonhereditary acquired degenerative condition of the eye. Spheroidal degeneration is characterised by sub-epithelial accumulation of spherical opalescent droplets that coalesce to form bands or nodules with elevated corneal epithelium. The degenerative process is mainly seen in the inter-palpebral part of the cornea.
Spheroidal degeneration may have a distribution in the cornea similar to that of band shaped keratopathy, and it also occurs in the conjunctiva.
Bietti et al in 1955, made his initial clinical observation of an unusual degenerative corneal condition characterised by deposition of yellowish globules in the superficial layers of the cornea. Bietti’s description of corneal degeneration, although it has been described by various names, is most commonly referred to as spheroidal degeneration. Fraunfelder and colleagues divided this condition into three basic forms viz.

Type I or Primary corneal type occurring bilaterally associated with increasing age and without any prior ocular (eye) disease.
Type II or Secondary corneal type associated with pre-existing ocular pathology or trauma.
Type III or Conjunctival type wherein conjunctival deposits are prominent with or without corneal involvement. Conjunctival form is found more commonly after the age of sixty years and may be associated with pinguecula.

Frequency of spheroidal degeneration varies with geographic location and increases with age. It occurs most often in areas that have high sunlight exposure and sunlight reflection off snow or sand, in combination with wind-driven corneal damage by snow and sand. Probably it is caused due to micro-trauma from wind and sand or by solar radiations. This degenerative disease occurs due to excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. Males are more prone to develop spheroidal degeneration, especially those working outdoors, as compared to females.","Spheroidal degeneration is asymptomatic in majority of the cases. Visual acuity may be affected if the deposits extend towards the center of the cornea, thereby, blocking the visual axis.
Ocular (eye) symptoms in advanced cases may be:

Irritation.
Discomfort.
Foreign body sensation.
Diminution of vision.","The exact cause of spheroidal degeneration is not known. It is hypothesized to be due to:

Drying of the cornea.
Repeated corneal trauma.
Wind driven corneal damage by snow (e.g. Arctic or Labrador region in Canada) and sand (e.g. in deserts). The specialised type of trauma related to ice and sand produces band shaped corneal spheroids arranged across the horizontal meridian.
Ultraviolet light exposure (confirmed also in the welding population). It may also be associated with blue light exposure. It occurs most often in areas that have high sunlight exposure and sunlight reflection off snow or sand.
Low humidity.
Spontaneous in the conjunctiva and cornea of the aged.
Associated ocular conditions viz.

- Traumatic corneal scars.
- Herpetic keratitis.
- Chronic corneal oedema.
- Lattice corneal dystrophy.
- Glaucoma.
- Pinguecula.
- Pterygium.
Although no definitive gene defect or inheritance pattern is established, it is thought that genetic predisposition to this condition, may play a role in its development along with environmental factors. Familial occurrence is very rare.
Although spheroidal degeneration is classically associated with ageing and ultraviolet exposure, it has also been described in childhood with much less frequency.","Diagnosis depends upon:
Clinical features:
Since spheroidal degeneration is associated with UV light exposure, patients may have other systemic findings of exposure to the elements such as history of skin cancer, pigmentary changes, or other actinic disorders.
Examination should be carried out under slit lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist.
Spheroidal degeneration is characterised by:

Fine droplets or globules: The presence of fine droplets or globules, yellow or golden in colour, beneath the conjunctival or corneal epithelium. The globules appear oily, although they are not of lipid origin. These may be clear but often become cloudy or opaque over the time. The accumulation of the globules primarily involves Bowman’s layer, however, it may occur in the sub-epithelial area and superficial layers of the stroma once Bowman’s layer is disrupted. The deposits in the epithelium may damage the corneal epithelium and the band-shaped configuration may extend to the center, leading to decrease in vision. The deposition of slight golden-yellow globules is variable from few globules to aggregate or diffuse globules occupying central portion of the cornea.
Lattice lines: Lattice lines may be seen in some patients. Lattice lines are short, fine, discrete, and measure about 1-3 mm in length. These appear clinically exactly like lattice lines in lattice corneal dystrophy. Some of the lattice lines are even seen deep in the corneal stroma. The lattice lines may be central, peripheral or bilateral. Lattice lines are seen among elderly patients and are observed in both primary and secondary corneal type. Lattice lines, unlike lines in lattice corneal dystrophy, occur late in life in the absence of family history and may be superficial and deep in the cornea. The lattice lines are usually non-arborising and lack orientation. The lines are thin, glossy and randomly placed, generally occupying the superficial layers of the cornea and close to the spherules. The lattice lines are not associated with painful recurrent corneal erosions and do not interfere with vision in patients with primary corneal type.
Fine greyish fleck like opacities: Fine greyish fleck like opacities are sometimes dispersed in between the lattice lines and beside the globules.
Amyloidosis: Amyloidosis of the cornea in spheroidal degeneration may be non-specific and is not well understood. It is believed that a decrease in the serum amyloid degrading activity may precede the accumulation of amyloid in the tissues. Amyloidosis of the cornea may be the result of multiple micro-traumas by sand, dust, UV rays and other factors.
Cataract and pseudo-exfoliation of lens: Cataract and pseudo-exfoliation of lens are common among patients of spheroidal degeneration.
Iris atrophy: Iris atrophy has also been observed.
Decrease in corneal sensitivity: Decrease in corneal sensitivity or hypoesthesia has been noted in one study.

A clear zone may exist early on between peripheral edge of lesion and limbus, but is lost later on.

Type I or Primary corneal type: Primary type is characterised by corneal lesions that occur without other ocular or corneal disorders. The lesions are usually symmetrical and bilateral. In the primary form, degeneration begins peripherally and advances toward the center in the palpebral fissure area. As the condition advances, the droplets become larger and more nodular and lift the central corneal epithelium. The conjunctiva may be involved in patients with primary degeneration, especially nasally.
There are three grades of severity of primary form:

Grade 1: Mild spherule deposition near the limbus. Fine shiny droplets are present peripherally only, without producing any symptoms.
Grade 2: Moderate spherule deposition with band shaped haziness. The central part of cornea is involved with some diminution of vision.
Grade 3: Large yellow aggregates of sub-epithelial droplets spherules reaching the central part of the cornea. There are large corneal nodules and vision is no better than 6/60 on Snellen’s vision test types. Disease may be rapidly progressive, followed by ulceration of involved areas of cornea, with secondary bacterial infection.

Alternative grading of the condition depending on the severity is:

Trace: Trace is characterised by small number of deposits in one eye, or only at the end of the interpalpebral strip in each eye (if bilateral).
Grade 1: In grade 1, there is sparing of central cornea with involvement of medial and lateral interpalpebral strips.
Grade 2: Grade 2 affects central cornea but there is no effect on visual acuity.
Grade 3: In grade 3, central cornea is affected with reduced vision.
Grade 4: Grade 4 shows elevated nodules in addition to the findings of Grade 3.


Type II or Secondary corneal type: Secondary corneal type is associated with other ocular disorders, corneal vascularisation and scarring. Secondary corneal type may occur along the edge of corneal scars.
Secondary corneal type is characterised by the presence of corneal scars and vascularisation with large and small yellow globules invading the epithelium, basement membrane, Bowman’s layer and superficial stroma. There may be scarring within the adjacent layers of the cornea. The location of the globules depends on the degree of Bowman’s layer disruption and the location of the corneal scars. Scars may be peripheral or central. The deposition is not always in a band-shaped configuration and can occupy the areas of the corneal scar. The disease may be either unilateral or bilateral. In cases with unilateral vascularized corneal scars, the degeneration occurs in the eye with corneal scars and may not occur in the other eye with clear cornea.
Recurrence of degeneration may occur in patients undergoing penetrating keratoplasty. Globular aggregates may occur in the corneal graft and usually in the center of the graft.

Type III or Conjunctival type: Conjunctival type may also show similar deposits on conjunctiva as are seen in corneal type. The conjunctival lesions may have engorged blood vessels.

Primary spheroidal degeneration:

Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections: Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections of the cornea show evidence of homogeneous proteinaceous globular deposits of variable sizes in the superficial layers. The globules are mainly seen along Bowman’s layer which may show disintegration being produced by the globular deposits. The spherules are then seen in the sub-epithelial space disrupting the basement membrane and the superficial stroma. The sub-epithelial aggregates of spherules may cause elevation and thinning of the corneal epithelium.
Masson trichrome stain: Masson trichrome stain reveals reddish-grey colour of spherules.
Verhoeff Van Gieson stain: Most aggregates of spherules stain positively with Verhoeff Van Gieson stain for elastic tissue.
Congo red stain: Congo red stain is positive in the areas of amyloid deposits which show birefringence with polarising light in some specimens with degeneration.

Staining for fat with oil red O and for calcium with Von Kossa stain is usually negative. Von Kossa stain may show positive staining for calcium in any associated calcification, but is rare.
Secondary spheroidal degeneration:
Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections of cornea: Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections of cornea show evidence of corneal scarring and vascularisation with homogeneous sub-epithelial globular deposits of variable sizes. Spherules may reach the superficial and even deeper layers of the stroma.
Electron microscopic study: 
Electron microscopic study of the globules in patients with spheroidal degeneration reveals aggregates of extracellular electron dense round to oval globules among the collagen fibrils of the superficial stroma. The globules are of different sizes and cause disruption of Bowman’s layer and the basement membrane of the epithelium.

Proteomic analysis and Pathogenesis:
Approximately 105 different proteins have been identified using proteomic analysis. Primary degeneration shows irregular collagen from abnormal fibroblasts. Secondary degeneration shows protein deposits from the interaction of UV light and plasma proteins (diffusing through the cornea from limbal vessels under normal conditions).
Spheroidal degeneration may be caused by an aggregation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and modified proteins resulting from UV radiation and ageing.
Corneal globular deposits show protein deposits having amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, cysteine and cystine, which are not normally found in the corneal stroma.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs): One study detected an up-regulation and increase in the level of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the tear fluids in patients with spheroidal degeneration. TIMPs (inhibitors of MMP), where found as part of complexes in the TIMP-1, were significantly lower in patients. This study demonstrated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 tear levels were significantly elevated and may have resulted in delay in corneal re-epithelialisation and corneal scarring. The reduced expression of TIMP-1 in spheroidal degeneration, such as deficient anti-proteolytic shield, which may lead to rendering the corneas of patients vulnerable to enhanced MMP activity.
Annexin and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): Annexin and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are the proteins identified in patients with spheroidal degeneration using monoclonal antibodies. Annexin is found in the periphery but not in the center of cornea, while in spheroidal degeneration, it is found in abundance in the central portion of the cornea. Annexin and GAPDH are known for membrane fusion and allows cells to adhere to the collagen. The increased accumulation of Annexin and GAPDH in spheroidal degeneration as compared to normal cornea requires further investigation.

Spheroidal degeneration may be differentiated from:
There do not appear to be other corneal conditions that resemble spheroidal degeneration of the cornea. However, conditions which may be considered are:

Band shaped keratopathy: Band shaped keratopathy shows deposition of calcium with ‘Swiss cheese’ appearance.
Pseudo-entrapment of eye ointment: Post-operative entrapment of eye ointment in the stroma of the cornea does not occur unless the material is forced under pressure. These resulting droplets are not characteristic of spheroidal degeneration. The droplets do not autofluoresce under ultraviolet illumination and they are easily identified without the use of a slit lamp. The eye ointment cannot be trapped in the crevice of a wound for long unless a pressure dressing is applied. Once the pressure dressing is removed the pseudo-entrapment of ointment disappears.
Changes in the conjunctiva: Changes in the conjunctiva such as cysts, lymphangiectasis, xanthomatous patches or the presumed forward migration of fat cells to the episclera from the orbital fat pads, are quite different from the spheroids of the conjunctiva.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
The majority of patients of spheroidal degeneration are asymptomatic.
Management of patients with spheroidal degeneration is mainly symptomatic. There is no specific treatment available for the resolution of spherules.
Most of the time, spheroidal degeneration pathology is located nasally and temporally, and observation alone is required.
General medical therapy:

Ultraviolet light protection: Patients with spheroidal degeneration should have protection against ultraviolet light damage with sunglasses, to avoid further damage due to exposure.
Topical artificial tears: Patients with mild degeneration may require lubrication with topical artificial tears. Lubrication can slow the process, if the tear film is decreased.

Surgical therapy:
Patients with corneal scarring and globules involving anterior central part of cornea compromising vision, or causing pain, may require surgical intervention.

Excimer laser assisted phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Phototherapeutic keratectomy with excimer laser may be used to gain useful vision. PTK may also be required for patients undergoing cataract surgery to improve visualisation.
Lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty: Lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty may be used in patients with irregular corneal surface.

The spheroidal degeneration recurs after conjunctival resection.

Prognosis:
Long standing keratopathy may lead to visual impairment caused by involvement of visual axis due to secondary scarring."
Salzmann's Nodular Degeneration,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/salzmann-s-nodular-degeneration,"Salzmann’s Nodular Degeneration is a non-inflammatory, degenerative process characterised by whitish-grey or bluish-white elevated sub-epithelial nodules in the superficial corneal stroma that are usually bilateral, mid-peripheral and slowly progressive. There is usually a clear area before the limbus. It can cause blurred vision if it occurs in central part blocking the visual axis. It occurs more often in women than in men. The nodules elevate the epithelium. Peripheral lesions tend to be vascularised and may look like pseudopterygium.
Salzmann described it as a dystrophy (genetic disorders characterised by deposition of abnormal material in cornea) in 1925, but it is a degenerative change that usually occurs years after some inflammatory condition of the cornea. He described it in association with keratoconjunctivitis, but with time, several different disorders coexisting with this degeneration were detected. To date, its aetiopathogenesis remains unknown, but it is considered to be associated with ocular surface inflammation or chronic trauma. The onset of the lesions is gradual and often occurs many years after the keratitis. The antecedent eye disease usually occurs in childhood. However, several cases with no previous corneal pathology have been reported and are considered idiopathic.
There are, usually one to nine discrete para-central lesions, often in a circular array at areas of corneal scarring or at the junction of old corneal scars and clear cornea. Each nodule is separated from other nodules by clear cornea, and iron lines may outline each nodule. The underlying stroma may be vascularised but the nodules are not vascularised.","Many patients with Salzmann’s nodular degeneration are asymptomatic.
Symptomatic patients may complain of:

Ocular (eye) discomfort.
Irritation.
Foreign body sensation.
Dryness.
Pain if recurrent erosions occur.
Photophobia.
Decreased visual acuity.","Though the aetiology remains uncertain in majority of the cases, it is hypothesized that Salzmann’s nodular degeneration can be triggered by multiple events that lead to a nonspecific corneal tissue reaction based on individual predisposition. It appears to be more frequent in middle-aged women, and may be bilateral in about 60% of cases.
Ocular surface disorders:

Meibomian gland dysfunction.
Phlyctenular keratitis.
Dry eye disease.
Rosacea keratitis.
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis.
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis.
Trachoma.
Interstitial keratitis.
Exposure keratopathy.
Thygeson’s superficial punctate keratitis.
Recurrent corneal erosions.
Viral diseases like measles.
Scarlet fever.
Chronic blepharitis.
Trichiasis.
Peripheral vascularisation of the cornea.

Chronic injuries:

Extended contact lens use.
Previous corneal surgery followed by actinic exposure, recurrent erosions, and chemical or thermal injuries.
Previous ocular trauma.

Recently, Salzmann’s nodular degeneration in patients with Crohn’s disease was reported, and a hypothesis about association with systemic diseases was contemplated.
Genetic causes have also been described.

Pathophysiology:
One of the hypotheses suggests that enzymatic destruction of Bowman’s membrane results in migration and proliferation of keratocytes from the stroma, resulting in secondary deposition of extracellular matrix components in nodular areas.
Histopathological studies have shown that the corneal nodules are located in sub-epithelium, but may extend to one-third of the anterior stroma and are formed by a dense connective tissue with hyaline degeneration. The corneal epithelium has an irregular thickness, with extremely increased thinning over the corneal nodules. The Bowman’s membrane exhibits disruption, may no longer be appreciable, and frequently replaced by fibrosis. Sub-epithelial fibrosis is a frequent histopathological finding, with activated fibroblasts beneath the epithelial cells. Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was recently detected in patients affected by Salzmann’s nodular degeneration, and this may be responsible for the induction of the basement membrane and Bowman’s membrane disruption.
Immunohistochemical analysis of protein expression in the basal epithelial cells suggests a high metabolic activity. This finding implicates the involvement of the epithelial cells in the formation of the sub-epithelial collagen elements seen in nodules. This in turn correlates with the clinical association linking corneal epithelial disease with the development of nodular degeneration.
Autoimmune aetiology has also been suggested in terms of pathogenesis of nodular degeneration.","Diagnosis of Salzmann’s nodular degeneration is usually made clinically.
The patients usually present with gradual, painless loss of vision for both near and distance. The combination of corneal nodules, corneal surface irregularities, and associated refractive error may lead to visual impairment. Visual impairment is progressive and due to an astigmatic defect produced by the nodules. Severe corneal irregularities in advanced stages generate high irregular astigmatism with severe visual loss. Patients may complain of reduced vision if the nodules are located in the central cornea.
There may or may not be a history of chronic ocular surface disease. Patients may also complain of a foreign body sensation on the surface of the eye. Elevated nodules can cause discomfort and epithelial erosions.
Clinical features:
Typical clinical signs could be observed during Slit lamp (biomicroscopic) examination by an eye specialist.

Salzmann’s nodules: Salzmann’s nodules are solitary or multiple white-to-grey or light blue nodules, elevated on the corneal surface, and located in the mid-periphery of the cornea. Each nodule is about 0.5 to 2mm in diameter and is not vascularised. In some cases, single or few nodules are present in one or more quadrants during routine ocular examination in asymptomatic patients, and sometimes, the nodules may invade the central zone. When multiple nodules are present, they have a typical circular arrangement and might be confluent in the advanced stages. A normal clear cornea between the nodules is a characteristic clinical feature.
Iron pigment deposition lines: Iron pigment deposition lines in the epithelium may be seen around the base of the lesions, and there is no further extension of these degenerative changes.
Recurrent corneal erosions: Recurrent corneal erosions may or may not be present.


Corneal topography: 
Corneal topography demonstrates the irregularities of the corneal shape produced by corneal nodules, and the induced surface alteration depends on their number and localisation.
Anterior segment- Optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT): 
Anterior segment- Optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) allows the evaluation of dimension and depth of nodules, showing stromal extension that can help decide the surgical approach.
In vivo confocal microscopy:
In vivo confocal microscopy shows normal epithelium in the central cornea with rare sub-basal nerve fibers that display increased thickness with lack of branching. Nerve fibers in corneal stroma are also abnormal in that their branches are very thick and tortuous with highly reflective segments. These stromal nerves resemble regenerating nerves as are seen after penetrating keratoplasty. Deep stroma and endothelium do not appear to be altered. The peripheral zone of the nodules displays basal epithelial cells that appear abnormally elongated. Confocal microscopy showed an increased reflectivity of the anterior stroma and marked stromal scatter corresponding to the nodules, as a result of the presence of fibrosis. Highly reflective structures representing activated keratocytes are present in both peripheral zone and in the sub-epithelial stroma of the central portion of the nodules.
Histopathology: 

Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) stain: Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) stain shows an absent or broken Bowman’s layer and a thinned epithelium overlying the nodules, in addition to disorganised sub-epithelial collagen fibrils.
Light microscopy: Light microscopy shows dense deposits of hyalinised, irregularly arranged collagen fibers anterior to fragmented, and sometimes, absent Bowman’s membrane. The tissue overlying nodules displays an attenuated epithelium. The corneal stroma contains unevenly distributed mitotically inactive keratocytes and disorganised collagen bundles.
Morphometric analysis: Morphometric analysis yields a thinned corneal epithelium overlying the nodules.


Salzmann’s nodular degeneration may be differentiated from similar conditions resulting in deterioration of vision such as:

Spheroidal degeneration.
Corneal scarring.
Corneal astigmatism.
Corneal abrasion.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Many elderly patients who have peripheral Salzmann’s nodules are asymptomatic and do not require any treatment.
Salzmann’s nodular degeneration usually does not resolve spontaneously. Depending upon the clinical picture, medical therapy or surgical therapy is required. Surgical therapy, when indicated, usually results in rapid improvement of visual acuity.
Any potential underlying aetiology should be managed accordingly.
General measures:

Eyelid hygiene.
Warm compresses.

Medical therapy:
Medical therapy, successfully treats most patients, and may include:

Topical artificial tears.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Topical corticosteroids.

Surgical therapy:
Indications for surgical therapy are:

Persistent ocular surface discomfort due to foreign body sensation or tear film instability.
Reduced visual acuity due to irregular astigmatism.
Recurrent corneal erosions.
Contact lens intolerance due to peripheral nodules.

Surgical procedures are:

Superficial keratectomy: In superficial nodules, manual excision with a crescent knife is sufficient and leaves a uniform smooth underlying surface. In the case of deeper in-growth that involves the anterior stroma, after nodule removal, the excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy is usually performed for significant anterior stromal haze or to make the surface smooth. In some cases with deep in-growth, the anterior lamellar keratectomy becomes necessary.
Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) is generally effective in establishing a uniform, smooth surface and in removing opacities causing optical degradation, while minimising induced refractive change. Nodules often have good results after PTK, but the condition may recur. PTK may be performed with or without topical mitomycin-C (chemotherapy drug used in treatment of cancers).
Lamellar keratoplasty: Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is performed when Salzmann nodules extend to or past the mid-stroma. This procedure is rarely required. Recurrence may occur within the graft.
Penetrating keratoplasty: Full thickness penetrating keratoplasty is usually not required. One study showed recurrence of lesions after several years.

The recurrent lesions are often not clinically similar to the original lesions but are indistinguishable histologically.
The recurrence of Salzmann’s nodules after surgical removal can occur with varying prevalence rates and periods of time.

Prognosis:
Prognosis is very good to excellent. Visual disturbance is relieved by lamellar keratectomy. The condition may recur after surgical excision."
Spinal cord Injury,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/spinal-cord-injury,"Spinal cord Injury is a term used to refer the damage to the spinal cord resulting from trauma (such as road accidents) or from disease or degeneration (such as cancer). SCI, with its resultant paralysis is one of the most devastating medical conditions of public health importance.
Every year 250000-500000 people suffer from SCI globally. Majority of these cases are due to preventable causes such as road traffic accidents, falls, violence. Premature deaths are two to five times more common in people with SCI than people without a spinal cord injury.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) resulting into paralysis has devastating physical, mental, social, sexual and vocational consequences for the injured. In addition, the injury increases the economic burden on the person who sustains an SCI and potentially his or her entire support network.","Symptoms of SCImay include partial or complete loss of sensation and movements of arms, legs and/or body. The most severe spinal cord injury affects the systems that regulate bowel or bladder control, breathing, heart rate and blood pressure.
Symptoms of spinal cord injury depend on the location of injury on the spinal cord and severity of injury. Symptoms may occur as

partial or complete loss of sensory function
inability to move arms, legs and/or body
loss of control of bladder and bowel
unnatural positioning of neck
Chronic pain
unconsciousness
signs of sock","The spinal cord is made of millions of nerves that carry messages between the brain and all parts of the body such as skin. muscles, organs. It is surrounded by bony rings called vertebrae or vertebral column. 
An injury to bony column can result in to damage to spinal cord or damage to spinal cord can also occur without damage to vertebral column.
After damage to spinal cord, the functions above the injury level continue to work but functions of spinal cord below the damage are affected. Spinal cord distributes following nerves-

Cervical spinal nerves-C1-C8
Thoracic spinal nerves (T1 to T12)
Lumber spinal nerves (L1 to L5)
Sacral spinal nerves (S1to S5)

Common causes of SCI -

Motor vehicle accidents are major cause in younger individuals
Falls- leading cause in elderly persons
Violence
Sports/recreation activities are more common causes in males
Diving into water that’s too shallow and hitting the bottom
Electrical accidents
Compression of the cord by a tumor, infection, or inflammation
Aneurysm (ballooning of a blood vessel), compression of a blood vessel or a prolonged drop in blood pressure","In a trauma case the doctor will check first to make sure the patient has a working airway, proper breathing and pulse. The next step for diagnosing a spinal cord injury is to assess an individual’s neurologic function. A neurological examination includes testing for muscle strength, sensory function and movement in arms and legs/body.
Diagnostic tests for a spinal cord injury include:

Plane x-rays-it detects vertebral misalignment or fracture though tissue masses such as injured ligaments or a bulging disc are not visible on conventional x-rays.
Computerized tomography (CT)-it is used to detect bone fractures, bleeding, and spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal), but CT has less ability to image the spinal cord or identify ligament injury associated with an unstable spine than MRI. A CT scan may provide a better look at abnormalities seen on an X-ray
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-It can detect brain and spinal trauma from injury, as well as helps in diagnosing brain and spinal cord tumors, herniated disks, vascular (blood vessel) irregularities, bleeding and inflammation that might compress the spine and spinal cord, and injury to the ligaments that support the cervical spine.","Essential measures for improving the survival, health and prevention from secondary conditions include the following.

Timely, appropriate pre-hospital management: quick recognition of suspected spinal cord injury and first aid at the time of injury is very important in management of SCI, as proper care during transportation can minimize the further damage to the spinal cord.
Immediate care appropriate to the type and severity of injury, rapid evaluation and initiation of injury management including immobilization of the spine, surgical intervention if required in accordance with the wishes of the patient and their family.
Provision of providing ongoing health care to reduce risk of secondary conditions and improve quality of life.
To provide health education to patient and their family.
Access to skilled rehabilitation and mental health services.
Use of appropriate assistive devices that can enable people to perform everyday activities they would not otherwise be able to undertake, reducing functional limitations and dependency.

The goal of management is to get the people with spinal cord injury to lead an inclusive life."
Substance abuse,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/substance-abuse,"Substance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs. The use of psychoactive substances causes significant health and social problems for the people who use them, and also for others in their families and communities. Substances of abuse include alcohol, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens, prescription and over-the-counter drug abuse. (Psychoactive substances are substances that, when taken in or administered into one's system, affect mental processes).
Psychoactive substance use poses a significant threat to the health, social and economic aspects of families, communities and nations. Globally, the prevalence of alcohol use disorders is significantly higher than the prevalence of drug use disorders. Generally, alcohol and drug use disorders are more common among males than among females. According to the World Health Organisation Report 2002 (WHO), 8.9% of the total burden of disease is due to use of psychoactive substances; tobacco accounted for 4.1%, alcohol 4%, and illicit drugs 0.8% of the burden of disease .There are 2 billion alcohol users, 1.3 billion smokers and 185 million drug users globally (WHO 2002). These three psychoactive substances have different disease burden on different age groups. Illicit drug use causes mortality earliest in life, alcohol also mainly (65%) before the age of 60, while 70% of the tobacco deaths occur after the age of 60.
The use of different substances varies in different WHO regions as in Europe and South-East Asia tobacco use is the largest burden while alcohol is the largest burden in Africa, the Americas, and Western Pacific.
155 to 250 million people, or 3.5% to 5.7% of world’s population aged 15-64 used other psychoactive substances, such as cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, opioids, and non-prescribed psychoactive prescription medication (WHO-2008). Globally, cannabis is the most commonly used substance (129-190 million people), followed by amphetamine type stimulants, then cocaine and opioids.
People who inject drugs (psychoactive drugs for non medical purposes) are at increased risk of HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Around 13 million people inject drugs globally and 1.7 million of them are living with HIV; injecting drug user accounts for approximately 10% of HIV infections. The estimated global prevalence of hepatitis C in people who inject drugs is 67%.
In India opioids are commonly used by IDUs. These opioids include heroin (‘smack’ / ‘brown sugar’) as well as pharmaceutical opioids (such as buprenorphine, pentazocine and dextro-propoxyphene). In the north-eastern region, heroin and dextropropoxyphene are the most commonly used opioids; impure heroin (smack), and buprenorphine are the most commonly used opioids in metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Pentazocine is the most commonly injected opioid in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chattisgarh. In the states of Punjab and Haryana, buprenorphine is commonly used by injectors. As per the HIV sentinel surveillance report, HIV prevalence among IDUs in India is 7.2%. However, some states have much higher HIV rates among IDUs such as HIV prevalence among IDUs is 21% in Punjab, 18% in Delhi and around 12% in Manipur and Mizoram.
Psychoactive substance use by drivers has been associated with impaired driving and increased accidents risk.
Health and social problems associated with use of and dependence on tobacco, alcohol and illicit substances can be prevented by greater awareness by individuals, families and societies to use appropriate public health actions.","Substance use problems can arise as a result of acute intoxication, regular use or dependence, and from the way in which substances are used. It is possible for a person to have problems from all of these.
Acute intoxication can occur as a result of a single episode of drug use. Intoxication is highly dependent on the type and dose of drug and is influenced by an individual's level of tolerance and other factors. Problems may be-

Ataxia, vomiting, fever and confusion
overdose and loss of consciousness
prone to accidents and injury
aggressive, unpredictable behavior and violence
unintended sex and unsafe sexual practices

The term acute intoxication is most commonly used with regard to alcohol use and in everyday speech it is called as “drunkenness"". Alcohol intoxication is manifested by such signs as facial flushing, slurred speech, unsteady gait, euphoria, increased activity, talkativeness, disorderly conduct, slowed reactions, impaired judgment and motor incoordination, insensibility.
Regular use- A variety of different problems can occur from using the psychoactive substances regularly ranging from physical, mental and social problems:

specific physical and mental health problems,
tolerance (person no longer responds to the drug in the way that person initially responded),
anxiety, depression, mood swings, irritability,
criminal offences,
relationship problems,
cognitive problems relating to memory or attention,
difficulties with regular job or study.

Dependent use: Dependence is usually associated with more frequent use of a substance, and at higher doses than used previously. The problems arising from dependent use of a substance can be similar to those observed with regular use, but are more severe:

craving and increased desire to use,
anxiety, irritability, gastrointestinal upsets and sleep problems,
increasingly dysfunctional in daily life,
marked tolerance,
criminal behavior,
relationship breakdowns,
difficulty stopping in spite of problems,
possible withdrawal symptoms on abstinence,
continued use despite evidence the use is causing harms to the individual.

Injecting of any drug is associated with following risks-

Dependence
Overdose
Psyscosis
Vein collapse
Infection
Local: abscesses and ulcers
Systemic-HIV, Hepatitis C

Specific health and other problems due to individual substances
Smoking/chewing of tobacco products

It is a risk factor for a number of serious long term health problems and increases the severity of diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes and asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.
Children exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke are at increased risk of health problems such as respiratory infections, allergies and asthma.
Pregnant women who smoke are at higher risk of miscarriage, premature labour and having a low birth weight baby.
Tobacco use is risk factor for cancers of lung, bladder, breast, mouth, throat and oesophagus.

Alcohol consumption alcohol use contributes to a wide range of diseases, health conditions and high-risk behaviours, from mental disorders and road traffic injuries, to liver diseases and unsafe sexual behaviour. 

Alcohol consumption at unsafe levels is a major cause of premature illness, disability and death and wide range of social problems.
Women who consume alcohol during pregnancy are at risk of having babies with birth defects, learning and behavioural difficulties and impaired brain development.
Liver and pancreas diseases.
Cancers of the mouth, throat and breast.

Cannabis-The likelihood of death due to cannabis intoxication alone is very low, although combination with other drugs can result in overdose and death. Cannabis use is associated with numerous negative health consequences.
Cocaine-Cocaine is a stimulant drug. There is a significant risk of toxic complications and sudden death, usually due to cocaine’s effect on the cardiovascular system.
Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) can lead to a wide range of physical and mental health problems.
Inhalants cover all volatile solvents that can be inhaled or breathed in. The most commonly used volatile substances include petrol, solvents, glues, sprays, lacquers containing benzene and glues or paint thinners containing toluene. The most common way they are used is to sniff them from a container, although some may breathe them through a plastic bag. The short term effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and diarrhoea. Higher doses can cause slurred speech, disorientation, confusion, delusions, weakness, tremor, headaches, and visual hallucinations. Ultimately use can cause coma or death from a heart failure.
Sedatives and sleeping pills: Tolerance and dependence on sedatives or sleeping pills can develop after a short period of use, and withdrawal from these drugs can be extremely unpleasant. Withdrawal symptoms include severe anxiety and panic, insomnia, depression, headache, sweating and fever, nausea and vomiting and convulsions.
Hallucinogens: These are the group of drugs that affect the user’s perceptions of reality by distortion of one or several of the five senses (vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch) resulting in hallucinations.
Opioids: Use of street or non-prescribed opioids (heroin and opium) can cause many problems for users, particularly as they are generally injected or smoked which can create further problems for the user.","Risk factors-
Some risk factors that can influence a child for later substance abuse and other problems have their presence during different developmental periods of life. Many risk factors are related and tend to cluster together. Following are the various risk factors:
Prenatal period:
Smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy can affect a developing fetus with altered growth and physical development and cognitive impairments in the child.
Infancy and childhood:
Insecure attachmentduring the child’s first year of life can cause a child to be aggressive or withdrawn and have difficulty interacting with other children or adults. Uncontrolled aggression during early childhood can lead to poor social skills and problems during preschool period.
Lack of classroom structurein the school environment can lead to additional social and behavioral problems in children and academic failure. At the same time, they may be exposed to greater availability of drugs, drug abusers, and social activities involving drugs. These challenges can increase the risk that they will abuse alcohol, tobacco, and other substances.
Parental abuse and neglect are commonly seen as part of the cause of drug abuse. An adolescent or pre-adolescent may be trying to gain attention from an inattentive parent or escape an abusive one by using drugs; prolonged attempts through drug use can be a cause of drug abuse.
Parental substance use can also affect child both directly and indirectly by disturbing family environment and poor parenting. There are increased chances of child abuse and neglect in such families.
Parental smoking in home can also expose children to secondhand smoke; putting them risk for health and behavioral problems as well as increasing children’s likelihood of smoking when they grow older.
Association with drug abusing peers is often the most immediate risk for exposing adolescent.
Mental illnesses can increase risk for drug abuse. 
Genetic factors also influence the person’s vulnerability to addiction.
Many people use substances because they have pleasurable or desirable effects, while others may use them to block out physical or psychological pain. Some people use these substances to increase their performance, to stay awake or lose weight.
Methods of substance use-

Injected with a needle under the skin, into a vein or muscle
Smoked or inhaled through the mouth or nose, or inhaled by placing a bag over the head (bagging)
Placed on a mucus membrane (such as inside the anus or vagina, the nose or under the eyelid)
Chewed, swallowed or dissolved slowly in the mouth
Rubbed in to the skin","In response to the overwhelming public health burden associated with psychoactive substance use worldwide, WHO experts developed the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST).

The ASSIST can be completed in about five to ten minutes and can be incorporated into the normal consultation at primary health care services.
A list of substances such as tobacco products, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), sedatives and sleeping pills (benzodiazepines), hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, ‘other’ drugs are included in the screening test.
The ASSIST obtains information from persons about lifetime use of substances, and use of substances and associated problems over the last 3 months.
It can identify a range of problems associated with substance use including acute intoxication, regular use, dependent or ‘high risk’ use and injecting behaviour.
The ASSIST determines a risk score for each substance.
The score obtained for each substance falls into a ‘lower‘, ‘moderate’ or ‘high’ risk category which determines the most appropriate intervention for that level of use (‘no treatment’, ‘brief intervention’ or ‘referral to specialist assessment and treatment’ respectively).

In brief the ASSIST comprises the following questions:

Question 1 (Q1) asks about which substances have ever been used in the person’s lifetime.
(Q2) asks about the frequency of substance use in the past three months, which gives an indication of the substances which are most relevant to current health status.
(Q3) asks about the frequency of experiencing a strong desire or urge to use each substance in the last three months.
(Q4) asks about the frequency of health, social, legal or financial problems related to substance use in the last three months.
(Q5) asks about the frequency with which use of each substance has interfered with role responsibilities in the past three months.
(Q6) asks if anyone else has ever expressed concern about the person’s use of each substance and how recently that occurred.
(Q7) asks whether the person has ever tried to cut down or stop use of a substance, and failed in that attempt, and how recently that occurred.
(Q8) asks whether the client has ever injected any substance and how recently that occurred.

Screening aims to detect health problems or risk factors at an early stage before they have caused serious disease or other problems, and is part of maintaining prevention practice activities in health care settings.","Management of substance abuse incorporates many components as it disrupts several aspects of an individual’s life. Addiction treatment must help the individual stop using drugs, maintain a drug-free lifestyle, and achieve productive functioning in the family, at work, and in society. Patients require long-term and repeated episodes of care to achieve the ultimate goal of sustained abstinence and recovery.
Principles of effective treatment should be:

Substance abuse is treatable.
Treatment varies depending on the type of drug and the characteristics of the patients
Treatment needs to be readily available.
Effective treatment must address the individual drug abuse and any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational and legal problems.
Behavioral therapies including individual, family, or group counseling are the most commonly used forms of drug abuse treatment.
Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients (such as alcohol, nicotine,heroin or other opioids), especially when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies.
An individual's treatment and services plan must be assessed continually and modified as necessary to ensure that it meets his or her changing needs.
The appropriate duration of treatment for an individual depends on the type and degree of the patient’s problems and needs. Usually recovery from drug addiction is a long-term process and frequently requires multiple episodes of treatment.
Several sub groups within the larger population of individuals affected by drug use disorders such as adolescents, women, pregnant women, people with medical and psychiatric co-morbidities, sex workers, and socially marginalized individuals, prisoners often require targeted and specialized care.
Target populations, their families, community members and local organization should be actively involved in the planning, implementation and monitoring of drug dependence treatment services.
As drug related crimes are highly prevalent, there should be coordination between drug dependence treatment and criminal justice system for such individuals."
Scabies,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/scabies,"Scabies is one of the commonest dermatological conditions in the world. It is a parasitic skin infestation caused by a mite called Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. The mite is so small that it is not visible to the naked eye. It burrows into the epidermis (top layer of skin), lays eggs, triggering a host immune response that leads to intense itching in response to just a few mites, (scabies is a Latin word that simply means to scratch). Scabiesis a contagious disease primarily related to overcrowding and poverty. Scabies is transmitted from human to human by prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies. 
Scabies affects people from every country, accounting for a substantial proportion of skin disease in developing countries. Globally, it affects more than 130 million people at any time and the prevalence varies from 0.35 to 46%. The highest rates are found in countries with hot, tropical climates, where infestation is endemic. Scabies is more prevalent in overcrowded communities with low socioeconomic conditions. Institutions such as child care facilities, group homes, and prisons are often sites of scabies outbreaks.
During a case study follow up, 81% of inmates of an orphanage in rural area of Maharashtra, India, were found to be suffered from scabies and all inmates were successfully treated with mass scabies treatment and health education. An epidemiological study conducted in rural community has reported the prevalence rate of scabies as 13%.
Scabies infestation is often complicated by bacterial infection, leading to the formation of skin sores and further complications such as septicemia, heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Young children and the elderly in resource-poor communities are especially susceptible to scabies; as well as to the secondary complications of infestation.
Although scabies is not a life threatening condition, yet it may be considered to be important from the public health point of view because of several reasons, namely it is found globally; severe itching is extremely distressing, social stigmatization; and indirect effects of various complications. Therefore more evidence for epidemiological links with cardiac and renal disease, better diagnosis, treatment, and public health measures are needed to control scabies.","Signs and symptoms of scabies include-
Itching (mainly at night)- Itching is the most common symptom, appears 2-6 weeks after the mite burrows in to the skin ( in a person who had scabies before, itching usually begins within 1-4 days).The most common places to have itching and rash are-

Hands: Between the fingers and around the nails
Arms: Elbows, wrists and armpit
Skin usually covered by clothing or jewelry: The buttocks, beltline, penis, and skin around the nipples, skin covered by bracelet, watchband, or ring
Head, face, neck, palms, and soles often are involved in infants and very young children, but usually not in adults and older children.

Infants and children who have scabies are often irritable. 
Rash- scabies rash can look like tiny bites or pimple-like.
Sores- Intense itching of scabies leads to scratching. Scratching the itchy rash can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection.
Thick crusts on the skin (Norwegian scabies)- Sometimes in immune-suppressed patients, including those with HIV/AIDS, or persons who have conditions that prevent them from itching and/or scratching (spinal cord injury, paralysis, loss of sensation, mental debility) a severe form of scabies develops; it is called crusted scabies. Another name for crusted scabies is Norwegian scabies. Crusted scabies is characterized by vesicles and thick crusts that can contain thousands of mites. Persons with crusted scabies may not show the usual signs and symptoms of scabies such as the characteristic rash or itching because of patient’s altered immune status or neurological condition. However these persons are very contagious due to the presence of millions of mites and are important to identify as they are a significant source of reinfection to the rest of the surrounding community.","Human scabies is caused by a mite (human itch mite) called Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. The mite is very small, barely visible to the naked eyes.
Scabies mites burrow into the top layer of the skin (epidermis), where the adult female lays eggs. The presence of mite proteins and faeces triggers an allergic reaction in the patient causing an intense itch.
Scratching can lead to infection of the skin with bacteria (particularly Staphylococcus aureusand Streptococcus pyogens), leading to the development of skin sores (impetigo). Impetigo can be complicated into deeper skin infection such as abscesses and immune-mediated complications as acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (kidney disease) and possibly rheumatic heart disease. Up to 10% of children with infected scabies may show renal damage in resource-poor settings and, in many, this persists for years following infection resulting to permanent kidney damage. Recurrent infestations are common.
Transmission of scabies-  
Scabies is usually transmitted by direct, skin to skin contact from infected person to another person; such as holding a baby, sexual activity, sharing a bed, school children holding hands. Close interpersonal contact is the main way of transmission. Sometimes people pickup itch mite from infested items such as bedding, clothes and furniture. The mite can survive for 48 to 72 hours without human contact.
People at risk are:

People living in tropical countries;
members of a household who share beds;
people live in an institution such as prison;
people with suppressed immune systems such as HIV infection.","Scabies can be diagnosed by the appearance of the skin, distribution of the rash and the presence of burrows and vesicles around the wrists and especially finger webs in adults and on the soles of the feet and ankles and sometimes the head in infants.
A doctor can examine patient’s skin from head to toe for the burrow marks of the mite and scabies nodules. Prolonged itching leads to the development of scabies nodules in adults; often found on the genital area, especially the penis and scrotum as well in areas around the breast.
Additionally, asymptomatic family members of the patient may also have burrows in the finger webs. If more than one family member has similar symptoms, this finding may favor the diagnosis of scabies.
For the confirmation of scabies, a skin sample may be scraped from the affected area (the hands between the fingers and the folds of the wrist) and can be examined under the microscope for the presence of scabies mite, their eggs and faeces.","Primary management of scabies: The aim of treatment for scabies is to suppress the discomfort due to the disease, to limit the risk for secondary infection and related complications such as (heart and kidney disease), and to limit the dissemination of the disease in the family and more widely in the community.
Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides, they kill scabies mites and some also kill mite eggs. Different topical scabicides may be used for the treatment of scabies such as permethrin 5% (caution in children aged under 6 months), 5% malathion in aqueous base, 10–25% benzyl benzoate emulsion or 5–10% sulphur ointment.
Use of oral ivermectin- It may be used in very closed communities, such as homes for the elderly. The current recommendation is to treat every inhabitant of such community.
Secondary management involves prompt treatment of the complications of scabies, such as impetigo using appropriate antibiotics or antiseptics.
Important tips -

The treatment should be applied to those with symptoms and contacts (usually whole household and sexual contacts). All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation (transmission of scabies by the asymptomatic member).

The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body with cool dry skin. Avoid hot scrub bath before application of scabicidal agent.

Scabicidal lotion or cream should be applied at bedtime to all over the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as well as the rest of their body.Particular attention must be given to areas such as the flexures, genitalia, between the fingers, under the fingernails and behind the ears.

The scabicidal agent should be washed off the next morning.

Clean clothing should be worn after treatment.

Care should be taken to ensure that children and infants do not put their hands in their mouths once the lotion/cream has been applied.

Bedding, clothing, and towels used by infested persons or their household, and close contacts (anytime during the three days before treatment) should be decontaminated by washing in hot water and drying in a hot dryer, by dry-cleaning, or by sealing in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. (Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin and simply laundering of the clothes, towels and bedding or even storing them for a few days is adequate).

Itching may continue for several weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed, because the symptoms of scabies are due to a hypersensitivity reaction (allergy) to mites and their feces (scybala).

If itching still is present more than 2 to 4 weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimple-like rash lesions continue to appear, retreatment may be necessary.

Skin sores that become infected should be treated with an appropriate antibiotic prescribed by a doctor."
Solar Retinopathy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/solar-retinopathy,"Solar retinopathy (photo-retinitis, foveomacular retinitis, photomaculopathy, or eclipse retinopathy) is the retinal injury induced by direct or indirect exposure to light. Harmful effects of viewing sun are well recognised. Solar retinopathy may be due to looking at solar eclipse with or without telescope, sunbathing, religious gazing of sun, and use of psychotropic drugs.
The effect of light on retina is being recognised since the time of Plato, who gave description of eclipse blindness.
Photic (related to light) retinopathy is a generalised term used for retinal damage produced by light. This may be due to solar viewing or may be produced even by the use of operating microscope.
Photo-retinitis damages the retina through photochemical effects, associated with rise in temperature. Sustained viewing of sun for more than 90 seconds through a constricted pupil may exceed the threshold for damage of retinal tissues.","Mild photochemical damage may not be symptomatic in patients.
Symptoms develop usually 1 to 4 hours after exposure to sun and is characterised by

Pain around orbits.
Diminution of vision (unilateral or bilateral).
Central or paracentral scotoma (areas of decreased or obscure vision in the field of vision).
Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light).
Metamorphopsia (distorted vision).
Chromatopsia (objects appear abnormally coloured e.g. erythropsia shows reddish colour).
Afterimage (persistence of image even after removal of stimulus).","Retinal damage to light is produced by either breakdown of the intrinsic protective mechanisms of the eye and/or to the external high risk conditions.
The development and severity of damage depends upon

Anatomic protective mechanisms of eye.
Area of tissue involved.
Wavelength of light.
Duration of light exposure.
Total energy exposure.


Mechanism
The mechanism of damage is primarily photochemical. This may be potentiated by rise in tissue temperature. Increased chorioretinal pigmentation facilitates light absorption, which increases the background retinal temperature. Retinal defences are broken by supra-normal exposure to light. Retinal phototoxicity was originally believed to be a permanent damage, but some visual recovery has been seen.
The extent of retinal injury and its possible recovery depends upon factors such as

Area of exposed retina.
Location of damage.
Spectrum, intensity and duration of light exposure.
Susceptibility of host.
Emmetropia or hypermetropia due to effective focusing of light on retina.
Systemic photosensitising agents such as tetracycline and psoralen, may predispose to damage due to light.","Diagnosis depends upon clinical history/symptoms, manifesting signs, and investigations.
Clinical signs
A small yellow spot with a grey margin may appear shortly after exposure in the foveolar or parafoveolar area. This disc shaped lesion is about 200μm in diameter which corresponds to retinal image of the sun. Mild cases may not show any lesion.

Histopathology
Acute solar lesion
Acute solar lesion shows injury to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with necrosis, irregular pigmentation, and detachment. Photoreceptors show minimal change only.
Weeks following acute damage
The yellow lesion is replaced by a permanent focal depression, with mottling of RPE or there may be lamellar hole. Vision may show some recovery, but scotoma and metamorphopsia may persist. Previous episodes of sun gazing show multiple areas of mottling in RPE.

Fluorescein angiography may appear normal or may show transmission defects. There may be leakage of fluorescein dye in acute cases.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) shows disrupted reflectivity in outer retina, or fragmentation of highly reflective outer retina.
Amsler grid testing may delineate small central or paracentral scotoma.
Multifocal electroretinography (ERG) shows decrease in amplitude with normal latency of the recordings.

Differential diagnosis

Welding-arc maculopathy.
Light flash or arc, produced by high-voltage electrical short-circuiting.
Other causes of lamellar depressions or holes like posterior vitreous detachment or trauma.
Post-surgical photic retinopathy.
Accidental laser exposure.","In management, there is no specific therapy for solar retinopathy.
Oral corticosteroids have been used in acute lesions, but a beneficial effect is not being demonstrated conclusively.
Further episodes of solar viewing should be avoided. Eclipse viewing should be avoided unless there is proper protective eyewear. Solar filters with high quality of filtration of absolute visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light are recommended for viewing of eclipse.

Prognosis
Prognosis is guarded. Some improvement often occurs. Part of the defect usually remains, and the visual scotoma may persist permanently."
Steatoblepharon,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology/steatoblepharon,"Steatoblepharon is the anterior prolapse of eyelid fat pad, due to weakening of orbital septum, resulting in a puffy appearance of the eyes. The eyelid fat pads play an important role in maintaining contour of eyelids. Eyelid fat provides fullness and smoothness to both upper and lower eyelids. Instead of prolapse, atrophy of eyelid fat may cause posterior sinking of eyelids resulting in involutional enophthalmos.
The upper eyelid contains two fat pads located in medial and central compartment. The lower eyelid contains three fat pads located in medial, central and lateral compartments.
In younger individuals, steatoblepharon may be seen as a familial condition. But in most of the cases, it is seen as an involutional phenomenon associated with eyelid laxity or dermatochalasis.","Patients present for cosmetic reasons.
There is fullness of eyelids due to prolapsed orbital fat.","Steatoblepharon may be a familial condition in younger individuals, and is not associated with signs of ageing.
In most cases, steatoblepharon is due to involutional process, associated with laxity of eyelids or dermatochalasis.
Excessive steatoblepharon may be associated with systemic disease such as Graves’ ophthalmopathy, where fat is increased in volume and may also be oedematous.","In the upper eyelid, the medial fat pocket is typically most prominent. Bulging in the lateral part of upper lid is primarily due to prolapsed lacrimal gland.
Steatoblepharon usually is associated with dermatochalasis and may be obscured by overhanging skin fold in upper eyelid.
In the lower eyelid, fat may be prolapsed in any of the three compartments. There may be two fat pockets or even one contiguous pocket. The lateral fat pocket is typically most prominent, but fat prolapse may involve medial and central fat pockets with a bulge across entire lower eyelid.","Management is primarily surgical. It is often combined with blepharoplasty.
For mild fat prolapse, orbital septum may be tightened.
For significant degrees of fat prolapse, orbital septum is opened and fat pocket is cauterised and excised.
In lower eyelid steatoblepharon without dermatochalasis, fat pockets are removed through a trans-conjunctival incision, without disturbing the orbital septum.
In cases with excess skin in lower eyelid, a trans-cutaneous incision is preferred, and the skin is tightened laterally.
Repositioning of fat beneath the descended malar fat pad may also be done."
Silicosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/silicosis,"Silicosis is one of the most important occupational health illnesses in the world. It is a progressive lung disease caused by inhalation of silica over a long period of time. Silicosis is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, fever and bluish skin.
Silica (SiO2 / silicon dioxide) is crystal-like mineral found in abundance in sand, rock, and quartz. Silicosis occurs most commonly as an occupational disease in people working in the quarrying, manufacturing and building construction industries. It is also reported from population with non-occupational exposure to silica dust from industrial as well as nonindustrial sources.
Exposure to large amounts of free silica may not be noticed because silica is odourless, non-irritant and does not cause any immediate health effects, but long-term exposure to crystalline silica-containing dust is associated with pneumoconiosis, and progressive massive fibrosis of the lung (PMF), lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, and other lung diseases and airways diseases. In India, more than 10 million workers are at risk of silicosis.
In 1999, the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) reported that around 3.0million workers are at high risk of exposure to silica; of these, 1.7 million work in mining or quarrying activities, 0.6million in the manufacture of non-metallic products (such as refractory products, structural clay, glass and mica) and 0.7million in the metals industry.There are also around 5.3million construction workers at risk of silica exposure.
In India silicosis is prevalent in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Pondicherry, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal among the workers of construction and mining. Prevalence of silicosis in India ranges widely from 3.5% in ordnance factory to 54.6% in the slate-pencil industry and this variation in prevalence is due to the silica concentrations in different work environment, duration of exposure and the job demands.
Silicosis is an incurable condition with its potential to cause permanent physical disability. As there is no effective specific treatment of silicosis, the only way to protect workers’ health is control of exposure to silica-containing dusts and to detect cases early through monitoring of currently and formerly exposed workers along with proper management to reduce disability.
Factory Act of India(1948) mandates a well ventilated working environment, provisions for protection from dust, reduction of overcrowding and provision of basic occupational health care. The main challenge of eliminating silicosis in India is in the informal, unregulated sectors of industry which do not fall under the control of the Factory Act of India. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) also emphasized for regulation of working environment, protective equipment to workers with proper health education.

niohenvis.nic.in/booklets/silicosis1.pdf","Silicosis is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, fever and bluish skin.

Early symptoms of silicosis start with shortness of breath after exercising and a harsh, dry cough. Patients may have more trouble breathing; phlegm production and cough up blood as the disease progresses.
Congestive heart failure can give their nails a bluish tint.
Patients with advanced silicosis may have trouble sleeping and experience chest pain, hoarseness, and loss of appetite.
Silicosis patients are at high risk for Tuberculosis (TB).

Silicosis can present in three different forms as acute, accelerated and chronic.
Chronic silicosis: It is most common form of the disease, generally develops after 10 or more years of exposure to low levels of crystalline silica. There is an abnormal chest X-ray in the beginning and then person will slowly develop a cough and breathing difficulty. 
Accelerated silicosis: This form of silicosis tends to show up five to 10 years after exposure to higher levels of crystalline silica.
Acute silicosis: It occurs with short-term exposure to very high levels of crystalline silica. Person experiences fever and sharp chest pain along with breathing difficulty. These symptoms can appear suddenly. Acute silicosis can lead to death with in few months.
Symptoms developed due to scarring of lung tissues known as pneumoconiosis.","Silicosis is caused by exposure to crystalline silica. Silica (SiO2 / silicon dioxide) is combination of silicon and oxygen. Silicon is very reactive, does not remain in the element form but combines either with oxygen and forms free silica (SiO2) or with oxygen and other elements and forms silicates such as asbestos. Silica and silicates constitute the bulk of most kinds of rocks, clays and sands.
Crystalline silica is found in rock, brick, and concrete. Grinding, sawing, crushing, or drilling of these materials produce a fine powder that causes serious respiratory problems.
The silica milling industry provides basic raw material to a large number of other industries such as silica flour is used in glass and high quality ceramics manufacturing, as abrasive cleaner, inert filler in paint and rubber industry, in making of toothpaste, scouring powder, abrasive soaps, chemical filtration, metal polishing. These dust particles, mostly 10 microns in size and smaller, are too small to see, but can penetrate to the deepest part of the human lung when inhaled. Chronic inhalation of such respirable crystalline silica (RCS) dust can lead to severe lung disease, such as silicosis and lung cancer. Further silicosis increases the risk of developing tuberculosis. RCS exposure has also been linked to kidney and auto-immune diseases.
Occupational exposure to silica occurs at workplaces in factories like quartz crushing facilities (silica flour milling), agate, ceramic, slate pencil, glass, stone quarries and mines. Silica flour in India is produced by small factories.
Non-occupational exposure to silica- Silicosis is also reported in population with Non-occupational exposure from industrial sources and non-industrial sources.

Non-occupational exposure from industrial sources occurs when dust emitted from above mentioned factories goes to the environment and affects people living in the vicinity. It is reported that in population living near to slate pencil industry in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, prevalence of non-occupational silicosis and non-occupational silico-tuberculosis was reported to be 12.6 and 6.3%, respectively.

Similarly, the people who shape and polish the agate stones in workshops in their homes are found to suffering with silicosis along with their families and neighbors.

Non-occupational exposure from non-industrial sources occurs naturally due to desert dust and sand storms in hilly areas. Some farming, construction, and demolition activities also contribute to the environmental exposure.

Crystalline silica” or “quartz” is a potent fibrogenic substance. Silica dust does not have any warning signal, because it is tasteless, odourless and non-irritant. Therefore, a large amount of dust may be inhaled by a worker without any warning sign. Various occupations where earth’s crust is disturbed can cause silicosis.","Person working in an occupation with exposure to inhaled silica or having non occupational exposure to silica with the symptoms like cough, phlegm, or breathing difficulty, or no symptoms (even working for long times) should be evaluated for silicosis.
Diagnosis of silicosis can be done with detailed occupational history, physical examination by health-care provider (decreased chest expansion, diminished intensity of breath sounds, areas of hypo resonance and fine to medium crackles in lung area, and tachypnea) and different investigations for the confirmation of silicosis. Investigations include:

Chest X-ray: Chest radiography is the most important tool for the diagnosis of silicosis.
Lung function test: spirometry
Sputum examination: It may be needed to assess for associated diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB). Though the detection of tubercle bacilli in the sputum of patients suffering from silicotuberculosis is difficult, because of walling in of the tubercle foci by silicotic fibrosis which prevents the discharge of tubercle bacilli in the sputum.
High resolution CT scan of the chest
Pulse oximetry
Bronchoscopy to evaluate the inside of the lungs
Biopsy of the lungs","As there is no cure for silicosis, prevention is still the best way to avoid the disease. Once diagnosis of silicosis is confirmed, management depends on the degree of lung damage.
Mild to moderate cases may need medicines to decrease sputum production, such as inhaled steroids and inhaled bronchodilators to relax the air tubes. While in severe cases people may need urgent treatment with oxygen and support for breathing.
Once the disease advances, the management is similar to many other chronic lung diseases and needs a multidisciplinary or team approach.
To keep the disease from getting worse, it is important to stay away from any additional sources of silica and other lung irritants, such as indoor and outdoor air pollution, allergens and smoke, and individual should be moved to a work position with no risk of exposure or counselling for changing of occupation may be required. Oxygen support or other ways to manage chronic lung failure, like the use of noninvasive ventilator devices, may be needed. In severe cases lung transplant may be considered.
Advice to silicosis patient:

Quit smoking
Get yearly vaccinations, (such as pneumococcal and influenza)
Monitoring for TB or other infections
Avoid further exposure to silica
Educate yourself about the disease
Have a plan to manage flare-ups of the disease."
Sub-conjunctival Haemorrhage,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/sub-conjunctival-haemorrhage,"Sub-conjunctival Haemorrhage or Ecchymosis, a benign condition, is a common cause of conjunctival redness. It is characterised by painless acute redness due to bleeding underneath conjunctiva, in the absence of discharge or inflammation.The major risk factors are trauma or contact lens wearing in young patients, but in elderly, systemic vascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and arteriosclerosis are common.
Recurrent or persistent sub-conjunctival haemorrhage needs to be investigated for systemic hypertension, ocular or systemic malignancies, bleeding disorders, and any side effects of drugs.
Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage may vary in extent from small petechial haemorrhage to an extensive one, spreading under whole of bulbar conjunctiva. Generally, sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is most often seen in temporal and inferior parts of conjunctiva. Trauma causes localised haemorrhage at the site of injury.
The vision is usually unaffected by the sub-conjunctival haemorrhage. An extensive sub-conjunctival haemorrhage may track into the eyelids. Normally, haemorrhage resolves on its own in one to two weeks. Two or three narrowly spaced episodes may also occur.","Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is usually asymptomatic and present as a flat sheet of homogeneous red colour having well- defined limits. The collection of bright smooth blood is confined to a sector of the bulbar conjunctiva, and is sharply demarcated at the limbus.
The posterior limit of haemorrhage is visible in sub-conjunctival haemorrhage due to local trauma to the eyeball. The posterior limit is not visible in haemorrhages due to orbital injury. A large haemorrhage may track into the eyelids.
During absorption of haemorrhage, the colour changes from bright red to orange and then yellow. Some pigmentation may be left behind in severe cases of haemorrhage.
Sometimes, there may be momentary sharp pain or a snapping or popping sensation.
Vision is usually unaffected, but substantially elevated haemorrhage with Dellen formation on cornea may affect vision.","Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is a very common condition.
Causes of sub-conjunctival haemorrhage includes

Idiopathic and apparently spontaneous, particularly in older patients
Trauma
Contact lens wear, especially in younger people
Common precipitants such as coughing, sneezing and vomiting
Surgical procedure in eye
Conjunctivitis
Systemic vascular disease such as hypertension, especially in older individuals
Vitamin C deficiency, especially in infants
Child abuse","Diagnosis of sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is mainly clinical.
There is acute and painless redness of bleeding beneath conjunctiva in the absence of discharge or inflammation. It may produce dot haemorrhages to extensive areas of bleeding.
Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is most often seen in temporal and inferior parts of conjunctiva, but trauma causes localised haemorrhage.

Histology
Histologically, sub-conjunctival haemorrhage lies between conjunctiva and episclera, and the blood elements are found in the substantia propria of the conjunctiva when a sub-conjunctival vessel breaks.","There is no approved therapy to accelerate the resolution of haemorrhage. It requires only reassurance to patient that haemorrhage will disappear in about two to three weeks, with blood turning from red to yellow before absorption.
Failure to resolve haemorrhage in persistent or recurrent cases require detailed examination. No treatment is required unless it is associated with serious conditions."
Siderosis Bulbi,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/siderosis-bulbi,"Siderosis Bulbi is a degenerative and pigmentary change in the eye that follows intra- ocular retention of a foreign body containing iron. Its degree of severity and rate of development depend upon the content and location of iron. Large, more posteriorly situated, and ferrous intra-ocular foreign bodies have the worst prognosis. Histopathologically, siderosis shows accumulation of iron within metabolically active cells. Cells of corneal epithelium, pupillary constrictor muscle, lens epithelium, trabecular meshwork, pars plana and retinal pigment epithelium all may be affected.
Von Hippel (1894) distinguished two types of siderosis: haematogenous in which iron is derived from the blood, and exogenous in which it is derived from an intra-ocular foreign body (IOFB).
Siderosis may lead to decreased visual acuity, iris heterochromia, brown- coloured deposits beneath anterior lens capsule and cataract formation.
Visual prognosis for siderosis is fairly good in some cases, but it is preferable to remove intraocular iron containing foreign body, wherever possible.","Symptoms of Siderosis may include:

Diminution of vision
Dilated pupil (It is an early feature)
Night blindness (It is an early symptom)
Heterochromia (affected side is darker in colour)
Yellow- brown cataract","Retained intraocular foreign body are common in open globe injuries, causing multitude of adverse problems, many of them leading to severe visual disability.
Iron can ionise and diffuse throughout the eye, and then is deposited mainly as ferritin, and sometimes as cytoplasmic siderosomes, in many ocular structures.
The iron ionises and spread to all ocular tissues. It is mainly concentrated in epithelial cells (cornea, iris, ciliary body, lens and retinal pigment epithelium), iris dilator and sphincter muscle, trabecular meshwork, and neural retina.
Toxicity to essential enzyme processes due to excess of intracellular free iron leads to trabecular meshwork scarring, secondary chronic open angle glaucoma, anterior sub capsular cataract (siderosis lentis), and neural retinal degeneration.","Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination.
Clinically, the process of siderosis bulbi may be divided into three stages:

Latent stage: It represents latent period following injury before manifestation of clinical signs.
Spread of iron: It represents diffusion of iron through ocular tissues.
Degeneration: Toxic effect of iron leads to degeneration of the tissues, particularly retina.

Structures such as iris, lens and retina can appear rusty clinically and macroscopically.
The iris is stained dark so that heterochromia results (darker colour in eye with siderosis). It is due to reddish brown staining of the iris.
Iron in anterior chamber angle may be seen as scattered black blotches which may resemble malignant melanoma. Trabecular damage due to deposits may produce glaucoma.
The lens is frequently yellow- brown with clumping of rusty material in anterior sub-capsular area. Iron deposits are radially distributed on the anterior lens capsule.
There may be pigmentary retinopathy followed by atrophy of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium. These changes may lead to profound visual loss.
Thus, clinical signs of siderosis include reduced visual acuity, mydriasis, heterochromia, brown deposits beneath the anterior lens capsule and formation of cataract. Electrophysiological changes include abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) and dark- adaptation study.
Intraocular haemorrhage may produce similar clinical and histopathological changes as are seen in retained iron IOFB. Iron deposition in tissues from an intraocular haemorrhage is known as haemosiderosis bulbi. Long standing cases may show trabecular meshwork degeneration and scarring.

Histopathology:
Histopathologically, siderosis is characterised by accumulation of iron within metabolically active cells. Cells of corneal epithelium, pupillary constrictor muscle, lens epithelium, trabecular meshwork, pars plana and retinal pigment epithelium all may be affected.

Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and periodic acid- Schiff (PAS) staining: In H&amp;E and PAS stained sections, iron may resemble melanin granules , although they are usually somewhat lighter in colour, more irregular in structure, and slightly larger.
Prussian blue staining: Iron particles are best demonstrated by Prussian blue staining, in which the iron granules stain deep blue, in contrast to melanin, which does not take up stain.","Management entails removal of retained IOFB. Removal of IOFB may stop the progression of siderosis.
Early surgical removal of metallic IOFB is recommended for good visual prognosis. It may be done through limbal incision or by using intraocular forceps with a pars plana vitrectomy.
The cataract should be operated upon in cases developing this.

Prognosis:
The visual prognosis for siderosis is fairly good in some cases. However, removal of intraocular iron is advocated, wherever possible. If extraction is deferred for some reason, then serial ERGs are helpful for monitoring retinal degeneration. IOFB extraction should be done if ERG deterioration is noted."
Tetanus,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/tetanus,"Tetanus is a medical condition characterized by a prolonged contraction of skeletal muscle fibers. The primary symptoms are caused by tetanospasmin, a neurotoxin produced by the Gram-positive, rod-shaped, obligate anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani. The infection causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to ""locking"" of the jaw, which makes it impossible to open mouth or swallow. If this happens, person can die due to suffocation. It usually occurs when a flesh wound becomes contaminated. If it is not treated, tetanus may lead to complications, which can be fatal.","Stiffness in the jaws (lock jaw). Muscle spasms and stiffness can spread from jaw into neck and limbs over 24 to 72 hours. Other symptoms include:

High temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
Sweating
Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
High blood pressure (hypertension)","Tetanus is caused by the Clostridium tetani bacterium. Clostridium tetani spores can live outside the body and are widespread in the environment. They are commonly found in the manure of animals such as horses and cows, and in contaminated soil. After they enter the body, the tetanus bacteria quickly multiply and release tetanospasmin. This is a type of poison known as a neurotoxin. If tetanospasmin enters the bloodstream, it can spread around the body, causing the symptoms of tetanus to develop. Neurotoxins block the nerve signals that are sent from the brain to the spinal cord and then on to the muscles. This causes the muscle spasms and muscle stiffness associated with tetanus.","Usually, tetanus can be diagnosed through the symptoms. But with the symptomatic diagnosis, a spatula test is also performed to confirm the diagnosis.
Spatula test: It involves inserting a spatula into the back of the throat. If there is no infection, the spatula will cause a gag reflex and patient will try to push the spatula out of mouth. However, if the tetanus infection is present, the spatula will cause throat muscles to spasm and will bite down onto the spatula.","There are two types of treatment for tetanus:
Preventive treatment -For people who are believed to be fully or partially vaccinated against tetanus and who have an injury that makes them vulnerable to a tetanus infection. Medication called tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is recommended if have a tetanus-prone wound and there is a high risk that it could be contaminated by tetanus bacteria.
Symptomatic treatment - For people who have developed the symptoms of an active tetanus infection. Three main types of medication is used to treat the symptoms of tetanus:

Sedatives
Muscle Relaxants
Neuromuscular blocking agents"
Thalassaemia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/thalassaemia,"It is a forms of inherited autosomal recessive blood disorder that originated in the Mediterranean region. In thalassemia, the disease is caused by the weakening and destruction of red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. People in thalassemia make less hemoglobin and fewer circulating red blood cells than normal, which results in mild or severe anemia. Thalassemia will present as microcytic anemia which may be differentiated from iron deficiency anemia.
Types of Thalassemia:

Alpha Thalassemia The alpha chain is produced by four genes, two on each chromosome 16, and the severity of the condition depends on how many of those genes have been mutated.
Beta Thalassemia Beta thalassemia can range from moderate to severe. The most severe form of the condition is known as beta thalassaemia major (BTM). People with BTM will require blood transfusions for the rest of their life.","Symptoms of thalassemia are the same as anemia which include:

Growth delay and poor feeding
Fatigue
Weakness
Shortness of breath
A yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice)","Both α and β thalassemias are often inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, although this is not always the case. For the autosomal recessive forms of the disease, both parents must be carriers in order for a child to be affected. If both parents carry a hemoglobinopathy trait, there is a 25% risk with each pregnancy for an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing is recommended for families that carry a thalassemia trait.","A physical exam may reveal a swollen (enlarged) spleen. Thalassaemia can be diagnosed using a blood test. A blood sample will be taken and sent to a laboratory for examination.

Red blood cells will appear small and abnormally shaped when looked at under a microscope.
A complete blood count (CBC) reveals anemia.
A test called haemoglobin electrophoresis shows the presence of an abnormal form of haemoglobin.

Antenatal screening: The purpose of antenatal screening (screening that is carried out during pregnancy) is to check for inherited disorders such as sickle cell anemia and to provide parents with information they need to make informed decisions.","Treatment for thalassemia major is a lifelong process which requires different specialists to manage the complications of the condition.
Blood transfusions: The main treatment for thalassaemia involves regular blood transfusions to provide haemoglobin that the body needs. A bone marrow transplant may help to treat the disease in some patients, especially children."
Tuberculosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/respiratory/lungs/tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. . Tuberculosis commonly affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It spreads from person to person through the air, when people who are infected with TB infectioncough, sneeze or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air. It is a disease that can be cured with proper treatment. India accounts for one fourth of the global TB burden. In 2015, an estimated 28 lakh cases occurred and 4.8 lakh people died due to TB. 
Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP)

  Standards for TB Care in India","Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. Common symptoms of active lung TB are:

A persistent cough of more than two weeks that brings up phlegm and blood at times
Breathlessness, which is usually mild to begin with and gradually gets worse
Lack of appetite and weight loss
A high temperature of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above
Extreme tiredness or fatigue
Night sweats
Chest pains
Less commonly TB infection can occure in other organs of the body, as :

Lymph nodes , bones and joints, digestive system, nervous system, bladder and reproductive system. This is known as extra pulmonary TB. Symptoms of extra pulmonary TB vary according to organ/system affected. Extra pulmonary TB is more common in people with a weakened immune system, such as those withHIV.","The main cause of TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a small, aerobics, non motile bacillus. TB spread when a person with an active TB infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets containing TB bacteria.
Risks factors: The most common risk factor associated with TB is HIV and other conditions that impair the immune system.
Other factors include:

Tobacco use
Malnutrition
Alcoholism","Symptomatic Diagnosis: Coughing for more than 2 weeks, loss of weight, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats, fatigue are common symptoms of tuberculosis. If someone has these symptoms, one should seek medical advice to check whether it is tuberculosis.
Blood tests

Sputum examination- Samples of mucous and phlegm are checked for the presence of bacteria.
Chest X-ray: This uses radiation to create an image of lungs. In TB infection, there are changes in the structure of lungs, which of lungs, are visible on the X-ray.
Drug susceptibility testing: It provides a definitive diagnosis of drug- resistant TB.
CBNAAT (Cartridges Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test): CBNAAT is used for early diagnosis of MDR-TB and TB in high risk population such as presumptive TB cases in PLHIV (people living with HIV), EP-TB (extra-pulmonary TB) and pediatric populations. The CB NAAT machines have been placed at most of the districts in the country at headquarter or Medical College, ART Center or major Pediatric hospitals.


For TB of extra pulmonary sites. Diagnosis includes:

Computerized tomography (CT) scan: A series of X-rays of body is taken at slightly different angles and a computer puts the images together to create a detailed picture of the inside of body.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan: A magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of the inside of body.
Ultrasound scan: High-frequency sound waves create an image of part of the inside of the body.
Urine tests
Biopsy: A small tissue sample is taken from the affected site and tested for the presence of disease.","Tuberculosis is completely curable. 
Initiation of appropriate anti-TB treatment wherever patients seek care (public or private health services) and sustaining all TB patients on complete treatment with patient friendly system and social support are important measures under RNTCP.
All health care providers (both public and private providers), laboratories and chemists have to notify the TB cases to local government health authorities (according to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Gazette notification, March 2018). Notification of cases is done with the case-based web-based TB surveillance system called “NIKSHAY” (https://nikshay.gov.in).
Free TB drugs are provided under the programme in the form of daily fixed dose combinations (FDCs) for all TB cases on the strategy of directly observed therapy (DOT).
DOT is a specific strategy, to improve adherence by any person observing the patient taking medications in real time. The treatment observer does not need to be a health-care worker, but could be a friend, a relative or a lay person who works as a treatment supervisor or supporter. If treatment is incomplete, patients may not be cured and drug resistance may develop.
Screening of all patients for rifampicin resistance (and for additional drugs wherever indicated) is done. For drug sensitive TB, daily fixed dose combinations (FDCs) of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in appropriate weight bands for all forms of TB and in all ages are recommended. Treatment includes two phases- intensive phase and continuation phase.
For new TB cases, the treatment in intensive phase (IP) consists of four drugs FDCs- Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol (HRZE) in daily doses (as per four weight band categories) for eight weeks and in continuation phase three drugs FDCs with Rifampicin, Isoniazid, and Ethambutol (HRE) are continued for 16 weeks.
For previously treated cases of TB, the intensive phase is of 12 weeks, where injection streptomycin is given for eight weeks along with four drugs FDCs (INH, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) in daily doses (as per weight bands) and after eight weeks streptomycin is stopped, the four drugs FDCs (INH, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) are continued for another four weeks. In continuation phase FDCs containing Rifampicin, INH, and Ethambutol are given for another 20 weeks as daily doses.
The continuation phase in both new and previously treated cases may be extended by 12-24 weeks in certain forms of TB like skeletal, disseminated TB based on clinical decision of the treating physician.
Patients eligible for retreatment should be referred for a rapid molecular test or drug susceptibility testing to determine at least rifampicin resistance, and preferably also isoniazid resistance status. On the basis of the drug susceptibility profile, a standard first-line treatment regimen (2HRZE/4HR) can be repeated if no resistance is documented; and if rifampicin resistance is present, shorter regimen for MDR-TB (multi drug resistant TB) regimen should be prescribed according to WHO’s recent drug resistant TB treatment guidelines.
RNTCP has introduced a new drug bedaquiline for MDR-TB under conditional access programme in 2016 across six sites, with a country wide scale up plan in 2017-2020.
Nikshya poshak yozana: For encouraging good nutrition during treatment period financial incentive of Rs.500/- per month is provided as a nutritional support to each notified TB patient for duration for which the patient is on anti-TB treatment. Incentives are delivered through direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme to bank accounts of beneficiary.

Turners Syndrome,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/turner-s-syndrome,"Turner syndrome is a genetic condition that only affects females. It is a chromosomal abnormality in which all or part of one of the sex chromosomes is absent or has other abnormalities (unaffected humans have 46 chromosomes, of which two are sex chromosomes). In some cases, the chromosome is missing in some cells but not others, a condition referred to as mosaicism or Turner mosaicism
Types of syndrome:

Classic Turner syndrome - where one of the X chromosomes is completely missing
Mosaic Turner syndrome - where one X chromosome is complete in most cells, but the other is partially missing or abnormal in some way in some cells, there may be just one X chromosome or, rarely, two complete X chromosomes

Sex chromosome:
Babies are usually born with 23 pairs of chromosomes. One pair of chromosomes determines the baby's sex. This pair is known as the sex chromosomes. One sex chromosome comes from the father and the other one comes from the mother. The mother’s contribution is always an X chromosome. The father’s contribution can either be an X or a Y chromosome. A baby girl usually has two X chromosomes (XX) and boys have an X and a Y chromosome (XY). The Y chromosome determines ‘maleness’, so if it is missing as in Turner syndrome, the sex of the child will invariably be female. A female with Turner syndrome has part or all of one X chromosome missing. This means the girl has just one complete X chromosome rather than two.","Short stature
Lymphodema (swelling) of the hands and feet
Broad chest (shield chest) and widely spaced nipples
Low hairline
Low-set ears
Reproductive sterility
Rudimentary ovaries
Amenorrhoea, or the absence of a menstrual period
Increased weight, obesity
Shield shaped thorax of heart
Small fingernails
Characteristic facial features
Coarctation of the aorta
Bicuspid aortic valve
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD (problems with concentration, memory, attention with hyperactivity seen mostly in childhood and adolescence)
Nonverbal Learning Disability (problems with math, social skills and spatial relations)","Turner syndromeis a genetic condition caused by abnormal sex chromosomes.
It only affects females who have a missing or incomplete X chromosome.","Pre-natal tests:
Turner syndrome may be diagnosed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling during pregnancy.
Often, fetuses with Turner syndrome can be identified by abnormal ultrasound findings (i.e., heart defect, kidney abnormality, cystic hygroma, ascites).
An increased risk of Turner syndrome may also be indicated by abnormal triple or quadruple maternal serum screen. The fetuses diagnosed through positive maternal serum screening are more often found to have a mosaic karyotype than those diagnosed based on ultrasonographic abnormalities, and conversely those with mosaic karyotypes are less likely to have associated ultrasound abnormalities.
Postnatal:
Turner syndrome can be diagnosed post natally at any age. Often, it is diagnosed at birth because of heart problems, an unusually wide neck or swelling of the hands and feet. However, it is also common for it to go undiagnosed for several years, typically until the girl reaches the age of puberty/adolescence and she fails to develop properly (the changes associated with puberty do not occur
A test, called a karyotype or a chromosome analysis, analyzes the chromosomal composition of the individual. This is the test of choice to diagnose Turner syndrome.","There is no cure for Turner syndrome, but many of the associated symptoms like short stature, sexual development problems and learning difficulties, can be treated.

Oestrogen replacement therapy such as birth control pill, has been used to promote development of secondary sexual characteristics. Oestrogens are crucial for maintaining good bone integrity, cardiovascular health and tissue health. Women with Turner syndrome who do not have spontaneous puberty and who are not treated with oestrogen are at high risk for osteoporosis and heart conditions.
Modern reproductive technologies have also been used. For example, a donor egg can be used to create an embryo, which is carried by the Turner syndrome woman."
Trichiasis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ear/trichiasis,"Trichiasis is an acquired condition characterised by posterior misdirection of previously normal eye lashes. The misdirected lashes may be diffuse involving the entire lid (diffuse trichiasis) or may involve a small segment of it (simple trichiasis). Simple trichiasis is relatively more common as compared to diffuse trichiasis.
Trichiasis is differentiated from pseudotrichiasis which occurs secondary to entropion (inward turning of eyelid). Both these conditions lead to irritation of cornea and may lead to punctate epitheliopathy. Trichiasis may lead to infectious keratitis, pannus formation or even corneal ulceration.
Trichiasis may be associated with conditions like trachoma or severe chronic staphylococcal blepharitis.","Patient may present with symptoms like:
- Irritation of eyes.
- Foreign body sensation in eye.
- Redness of eyes.
- Watering.
- Eye discharge.
- Pain in eyes.
- Increased sensitivity to light.
- Corneal abrasion.
- Corneal ulceration.
- Symblepharon (adhesion of eyelids to the eyeball).
- Loss of normal eyelid margin structures e.g. madarosis (absence or loss of eye lashes).
- Dryness of eyes due to keratinisation.","There are various causes of trichiasis:-
Infectious causes:
- Trachoma.
- Herpes zoster.
Autoimmune:
- Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
Inflammatory:
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome
- Vernal keratoconjunctivitis.
- Chronic staphylococcal blepharitis.
Chemical:
- Alkali burns.
- Use of glaucoma eye drops.
Trauma:
- Repair of orbital floor fracture.
- Blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery).
- Repair of ectropion.
- Following enucleation.
Thermal burns to the lids:","Diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination.
History:
History of following conditions may be elaborated for the diagnosis:-
- Eye infections like trachoma or herpes zoster.
- Trauma or surgery of the lids.
- Chemical or thermal burns.
- Use of glaucoma eye drops.
- Inflammatory conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or chronic blepharitis.
- Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
Clinical features:
Clinical examination helps in finding the cause of trichiasis.
Examination may require slit-lamp examination by a qualified eye-specialist.
- Trachoma: Trachoma may cause posterior lamellar (tarsus and conjunctiva) scarring. Scarring causes difficulty in eversion of eyelid.
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid: These conditions lead to symblepharon formation and fornix (junction of eyelid and eyeball conjunctiva) scars.
- Involutional entropion with horizontal lid laxity: Horizontal lid laxity may be tested by snap back test. Examiner pulls lower lid down and observes the lid returning to its original position without allowing patient to blink. Normally, lid returns back quickly without blinking, but in increased laxity, blink may be needed for its return to normal position. The examiner can also pull the lower lid anteriorly away from the globe. In involutional entropion, lid may be pulled away by 6-15mm from the globe, as compared to 2-3mm only in normal lid.
Trichiasis should be differentiated from conditions like:-
- Congenital distichiasis: In congenital distichiasis, there is partial or complete second row of eye lashes growing out of or slightly behind the meibomian gland orifices. Eye lashes in this condition are thinner, shorter and less pigmented than normal cilia (eye lashes).
- Acquired metaplastic eye lashes: Acquired metaplastic eye lashes may occur in late stages of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, trachoma and chemical burns. In this, eye lashes exit near the meibomian gland orifices and are associated with other changes such as keratinisation of the conjunctiva.
- Congenital epiblepharon: Congenital epiblepharon shows an extra horizontal fold of skin which stretches across the lid margin. The eye lashes may be turned upward, particularly medially. These may touch the cornea but they rarely cause discomfort in the eye. In epiblepharon, on pulling the lid down, the lashes turn out and the normal position of lid margin becomes visible.
- Entropion: Entropion causes inversion of eyelid margin and pseudotrichiasis. Eyelash produces irritation to the exposed surface of the eyeball. In congenital entropion, on pulling the lid down, the entire eyelid is pulled away from the eyeball, unlike congenital epiblepharon.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Management of trichiasis is primarily surgical.
Medical therapy:
- Artificial tears and ointments: Lubricating artificial tears and ointments may decrease the irritant effect of eyelash rubbing against the eyeball.
Diseases like ocular cicatricial pemphigoid and Stevens-Johnson syndrome require medical therapy of the disease, in addition to treatment of trichiasis.
Surgical therapy:
- Epilation: Epilation involves mechanical removal of eyelashes with forceps.
- Electrolysis: Eyelash follicle is destroyed by passage of electric current through a fine needle inserted into lash root.
- Cryotherapy: Cryoprobe freezes the lash follicles and destroys it. It should be avoided in cases with ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
- Laser thermoablation: Laser thermoablation may be used to destroy eyelash follicles.
- Radiofrequency ablation: Smallest gauge wire is introduced alongside the lash to the follicle for destruction with radiofrequency."
Trachoma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/trachoma,"Trachoma is a chronic keratoconjunctivitis caused by four ocular serotypes A, B, Ba and C of organism Chlamydia trachomatis. It is a disease of underprivileged populations living in poor conditions of hygiene.
Active trachoma is most common in young children with the prevalence decreasing with age. Trachoma is a common infectious cause of blindness and is due to recurrent eye infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The common house-fly is the major vector in perpetuating infection-reinfection cycle. Long-term sequlae of trachoma in adults relate to their exposure to active trachoma when they were young. Repeat infection by this organism leads to conjunctival inflammation, scarring, trichiasis and blinding corneal opacification.","Most of the individuals with trachoma are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms depending on the severity of inflammation. Symptoms in eye are similar to those seen in any chronic conjunctivitis and may include:-
- Redness.
- Irritation.
- Itching.
- Pain.
- Swelling.
- Foreign body sensation.
- Blepharospasm.
- Watering.
- Eye discharge.
- Dryness of eyes due to scarring.
- Diminution of vision.","Trachoma is caused by repeated conjunctival infection with serotypes A, B, Ba and C of organism Chlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydiae are gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria. The incubation period for trachoma is 5-12 days.
Chlamydia trachomatis causes trachoma and also genital infections (serotypes D to K) and disease Lymphogranuloma venereum (serotypes L1 to L3). Infection with genital serotypes D to K can cause isolated episodes of Ophthalmia neonatorum in infants or inclusion conjunctivitis in adults. Genital serotypes do not cause trachoma blindness since they do not enter stable transmission cycles within communities. Serotypes D to K occasionally cause sub-acute follicular conjunctivitis but conjunctival scarring is rare.
Two phases, active and cicatricial (scarring) exists for the disease process.
Active trachoma occurs most commonly in preschool children, with the highest prevalence in children aged 3-5 years.
Cicatricial trachoma is most common in middle-aged people. The age group in which cicatricial disease begins to appear depends on the intensity of its transmission in the community.
Risk factors for active trachoma:
Individual-level risk factors:-
- Having siblings with active disease.
- Dirty face which attract flies.
- Crowded sleeping arrangement enables exchange of secretions.
Community-level risk factors:-
- Inadequate water access for personal hygiene.
- Limited toilet facilities and poor sanitation leads to increased faecal contamination of the environment which provides a breeding ground for flies.
- Control of flies.
Recurrent episode of active trachoma infection leads to blindness. Initial infection is confined to conjunctival epithelium and triggers an immune response. Repeat infection with subsequent inflammatory response results in tissue destruction, scarring, contraction and buckling of tarsal plate of upper lid, leading to cicatricial entropion and trichiasis, and corneal opacification by lashes rubbing against it.","Diagnosis of trachoma mainly depends upon clinical presentation.
Most patients with active trachoma are relatively asymptomatic. Active phase resembles many other diseases in which follicular conjunctivitis is a feature.
The cicatricial phase has unique clinical features, which helps in diagnosing trachoma. Conjunctival scarring alone tends to be asymptomatic, though the associated disturbance of tear film (produced by scarring of mucous and serous glands) often leads to dry eye. Trichiasis causes foreign body sensation as well as blepharospasm. Constant rubbing of eyelashes may lead to corneal opacification and impairment of vision.
WHO grading and clinical features of trachoma:
Slit-lamp examination by an eye-specialist is required for grading.
Active trachoma is characterised by muco-purulent keratoconjunctivitis. Conjunctival surface of upper eyelid develops follicular and inflammatory response. Cornea may have limbal follicles, pannus (superior neovascularisation of cornea) formation and punctate keratitis. Other extra-ocular mucous membranes like nasopharynx may be involved leading to nasal discharge.
Follicular Trachoma (TF):
Follicular trachoma is defined as the presence of 5 or more follicles at least 0.5 mm in diameter in the central part of upper tarsal conjunctiva.
Follicular trachoma indicates active disease. This form is most commonly found in children, with peak prevalence in those aged 3-5 years of age.
Follicles are germinal centers that primarily consist of lymphocytes and monocytes. Involution of follicles at limbus (corneoscleral junction) gives rise to pathognomonic lesion of past trachoma in the form of Herbert pits.
Intense inflammatory trachoma (TI):
Intense inflammatory trachoma is defined as pronounced inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than one half of the normal deep tarsal vessels.
Intense inflammatory trachoma also indicates active disease. Thin tarsal conjunctiva develops a velvety thickening. Papillae may also be visible. Intense inflammatory trachoma indicates increased potential for significant conjunctival scarring and corneal opacification.
Trachomatous scarring (TS):
Trachomatous scarring is defined as the presence of easily visible scars in tarsal conjunctiva. Upper tarsal conjunctiva may show scarring as Arlt’s line.
Trachomatous scarring indicates past inflammatory disease and a risk of trichiasis. Severe the scarring, higher is the risk of subsequent trichiasis.
This form may be associated with the development of dry eye syndrome, but chronic low-grade bacterial conjunctivitis and dacryocystitis (inflammation of lacrimal sac) may lead to watering of eyes.
Trichiasis (TT):
Trachomatous trichiasis is defined as the presence of at least one eyelash rubbing on the eyeball or there is evidence of recent removal of in-turned eyelashes.
This is a potentially blinding lesion that can lead to corneal opacification.
Trichiasis is due to subconjunctival fibrosis over the tarsal plate which leads to distortion of lid.
Successful correction of trichiasis may help in restoring some vision.
Corneal Opacity (CO):
Corneal opacity is defined as easily visible corneal opacity over the pupil that is so dense that at least part of the pupillary margin is blurred, when viewed through the opacity.
Corneal opacity reflects the prevalence of visual loss and blindness resulting from trachoma.
This condition includes pannus, epithelial vascularisation and infiltration only if it involves central cornea.
Laboratory diagnosis:
In endemic regions, diagnosis is almost always based on clinical features.
Laboratory investigations are mainly used in research.
- Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs): Nucleic acid amplification test is the best laboratory technique, of which polymerase chain reaction is an example.
NAATs have high sensitivity and specificity but are expensive and not widely available.
- Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assay: Direct fluorescent antibody assay of conjunctival smears is less sensitive than NAATs.
- Enzyme immunoassay (EIA): Enzyme immunoassay of conjunctival smears is also less sensitive than NAATs.
- Cell culture: Cell culture has high specificity but only moderate sensitivity. Cell culture requires a highly specialised laboratory and is expensive. Newer diagnostic methods have superseded cell culture.
- Giemsa cytology: Giemsa cytology is microscopic examination of stained conjunctival scrapings for intracytoplasmic inclusions. This test is highly specific but has low sensitivity.
Histopathological features:
Trachomatous inflammation is characterised predominantly by lymphocytic and monocytic infiltrate with plasma cells and macrophages in follicles. Follicles have typical germinal centers with islands of B-cells proliferation, surrounded by number of T-cells.
With inflammation, there may be formation of papillae. Recurrent conjunctival re-infection causes prolonged inflammation and conjunctival scarring. Scarring is associated with atrophy of conjunctival epithelium, loss of goblet cells and replacement of normal loose vascular sub-epithelial stroma with bands of collagen.

Trachoma should be differentiated from:-
- Acute inclusion conjunctivitis.
- Neonatal conjunctivitis.
- Toxic follicular conjunctivitis caused by topical medications or other compounds.
- Allergic conjunctivitis which shows typical cobblestone papillae.
- Bacterial conjunctivitis.
- Viral conjunctivitis.
- Trichiasis due to other causes such as entropion.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends the ‘SAFE’ strategy for the management of trachoma. The strategy was developed by WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma by the year 2020 (GET 2020) and utilises a four step approach:-
- S (Surgery for Trichiasis): Eyelid surgery to correct entropion and/or trichiasis may prevent trachomatous visual impairment and blindness in individuals at immediate risk. Eyelid bi-lamellar tarsal rotation surgery limits the progression of corneal scarring. In some cases, it can result in slight improvement in visual acuity. Adjuvant single dose azithromycin is given at the time of surgery.
- A (Antibiotics for Chlamydia trachomatis infection): WHO recommends oral azithromycin and tetracycline eye ointment for trachoma control. Azithromycin eye drops have also been shown to be very effective. Beneficial secondary effects of azithromycin include its treatment of genital, respiratory and skin infections.
Aim in treatment is to reduce the reservoir of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in the family. All family members, including infants, should be treated for trachoma. In hyper-endemic areas, whole community should be treated with antibiotics.
Sulphacetamide (topical sulphonamide) eye drops are also being used.
- F (Facial cleanliness): Facial cleanliness in children reduces both the risk and the severity of active trachoma.
- E (Environmental change to improve sanitation and increase access to clean water): General improvements in personal and community hygiene are associated with a reduction in prevalence and eventually the disappearance of trachoma. Environmental improvement activities are the promotion of improved water supplies and improved household sanitation, particularly methods for safe disposal of human faeces. The flies that transmit trachoma preferentially lay their eggs on human faeces lying exposed on soil.

Prognosis:
Prognosis of trachoma depends on the severity of disease at the time of treatment, institution of appropriate treatment and the risk of re-infection.
Patients with early and appropriate treatment have excellent prognosis.
Severe disease may be stabilised, but vision may not improve once corneal scarring develops.
Re-infection worsens the prognosis in a patient."
Toxic Keratoconjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/toxic-keratoconjunctivitis,"Toxic keratoconjunctivitis or Toxic conjunctivitis may result from topical preparations for the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. Topical ophthalmic preparations can confuse the diagnosis of toxic keratoconjunctivitis. Medications often alleviate the symptoms initially and only at a later time, sometimes years after initiating therapy, will the patient develop discomfort. Common toxic agents are glaucoma medications, preservatives, antibiotics and antivirals. Patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) are particularly at risk.
Ebers papyrus from ancient Egypt mentions eye remedies including red lead, antimony, lead, sea salt, iron and sulphur (Magnus H. Ophthalmology of the ancients. In: Wayenborgh J, editor. Hirschberg history of ophthalmology, vol. 4. Ist ed. Oostende: Wayenborgh; 1998: 4-12). In 1864, Albrecht von Graefe reported a case of toxic keratoconjunctivitis following administration of topical atropine (Wilson 2nd FM. Adverse external ocular effects of topical ophthalmic therapy: an epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical study. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc 1983; 81: 854-965). Treatment for Glaucoma is of particular importance, since topical therapy may last for decades.
Main ocular allergic diseases under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC) are viz. seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). Contact dermatitis is due to exogenous factors and it may be produced by irritant or is allergic in nature. Irritant contact dermatitis, such as toxic reaction to eye-drops, is caused by direct damage. Toxic keratoconjunctivitis may be produced due to damage of ocular tissues by an agent, usually an ocular drug or a preservative. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to a particular allergen.","Toxic keratoconjunctivitis may produce symptoms such as:
Eyelids and Periorbital skin:

Oedema.
Itching (pruritus).
Urticaria.
Dermatitis.

Conjunctiva:

Redness.
Mucoid discharge.
Chemosis.
Itching.

Cornea:

Photophobia (sensitivity to light).
Corneal lesions, such as ulcers.","There is no single mechanism responsible for drug intolerance or toxicity, but a combination of these occurs simultaneously, or in sequence and cause symptoms.
Direct toxic effects: Medications can be directly toxic to the conjunctival and corneal epithelium, damaging its structure and altering its function with or without an inflammatory response. Some preparations are directly toxic due to change in pH, osmolarity of solution, or due to photosensitisation. Direct toxic effects usually occur after the first contact and appear after a threshold is reached.
The cellular reaction may reflect the direct effect due to

Active compound.
Accompanying preservative.
Breakdown products.

Immunological mechanisms: Topical preparations can also induce damage through immunological mechanisms. These reactions are classified into following categories:

Type I hypersensitivity: Allergic reactions due to type I hypersensitivity are triggered by the union of allergen and initiation of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) - mast cell axis, leading to de-granulation and release of inflammatory mediators.
Type II-III hypersensitivity: Type II-III hypersensitivity is triggered by antibody-specific and immune-complex-mediated effects.
Type IV or delayed hypersensitivity: Type IV or delayed hypersensitivity is associated with marked epithelial and sub-epithelial oedema and infiltration by CD4+ lymphocytes and Langerhans cells (Langerhans cells are potent antigen-presenting cells of the conjunctival epithelium).

Indirect mechanisms: Ophthalmic treatments may also be toxic through more indirect mechanisms.

Bacterial colonisation: Antimicrobials modify the ocular surface microbes and may favour bacterial colonisation by selecting resistant strains.
Decreased local immune mechanisms: Corticosteroids may decrease local immune mechanisms.
Decrease in tear production: Parasympatholytics and antihistamines may decrease tear production.
Toxicity to goblet cells: Preservatives may cause direct cytotoxicity to goblet cells.
Detergent effect: Preservative like benzalkonium chloride may have a detergent like effect on lipid layer of tear film leading to evaporation of tears.","For the diagnosis of Toxic keratoconjunctivitis, a detailed clinical history is important. A common history is that the eye disease improved upon initial treatment, but the symptoms in eye worsened with continued use. Clinical manifestations resolve when the topical medication is discontinued. Patients often do not communicate the routine use of over-the-counter (OTC) eye preparations, such as artificial tears or vasoconstrictors. Hypersensitivity reactions to topical ocular medications usually take place early in the course of treatment, but toxic reactions usually occur after prolonged use of drugs.
One should be aware of topical anaesthetic abuse or indiscriminate use of topical antibiotics. It is important to obtain information on medication storage habits and to confirm expiry dates, since patients often keep previously used medicines and use it, if symptoms return.
Diagnosis requires examination under slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist. Staining of cornea and conjunctiva with fluorescein sodium and rose Bengal dye may be required to identify the lesions.
Clinical ocular (eye) features:
Most common toxic reaction is toxic papillary keratoconjunctivitis, which occurs due to repeated use of irritating medicine. The effect usually develops two weeks after exposure to the drug and may lead to a decreased compliance by patient.
Periorbital Skin and Eyelids (ocular adnexa):

Oedema.
Pruritus (itching).
Urticaria: 

Oedema, pruritus (itching) and urticaria of the eyelids are characteristic of type I hypersensitivity.

Dermatitis: Dermatitis involving periorbital skin is characteristic of type IV hypersensitivity, specifically if it appears a few days after the initiation of a new drug. Dermatitis may rarely simulate seborrhoeic blepharitis.
Lacrimal punctum: There may be fibrosis and obliteration of lacrimal punctum, thereby compromising its patency.

Conjunctival features may be:

‘Up-down sign’ of drug toxicity: When patient looks up, the lower bulbar and forniceal conjunctiva show intense congestion. Inferior bulbar conjunctiva may also show epithelial defects when stained with fluorescein sodium dye. When patient looks down, the upper bulbar and forniceal conjunctiva are white and non-congested.
Papillary reaction.
Follicular reaction.
Mucoid discharge.
Pruritus.
Conjunctival scarring. 
Conjunctival erosions.
Chemosis.
Hyperaemia.

     Hyperaemia and chemosis are more subtle and difficult to assess.
Cornea:

Punctate epitheliopathy: Punctate epitheliopathy predominates in the inferior-nasal quadrant, where there is maximal contact time between the drug and ocular surface.
Persistent epithelial corneal defects.
Hurricane keratopathy: Hurricane keratopathy is the whorl pattern, seen with exaggerated corneal epithelial cell turnover. The corneal epithelium may be opaque and oedematous.
Corneal ulcers: Inferior-nasal quadrant is also the usual location of corneal ulcers (with rolled edges) due to anaesthetic abuse, which resembles neurotrophic keratitis. There may be papillary response and intense ciliary flush.
Filamentary keratopathy.
Corneal necrosis.
Pseudo-dendrites.

Tear film:

Tear film break-up time (BUT) may be reduced.


Histopathology:
Topical ophthalmic preparations can confuse the diagnosis of Toxic conjunctivitis. Medications may damage structure and alter function of conjunctiva and cornea with or without an inflammatory response. Toxic effect of these substances may lead to infiltration of substantia propria, by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts, which eventually lead to fibrosis.
Immunological mechanisms may lead to:

Type I hypersensitivity: There is release of inflammatory mediators triggered by the union of the allergen with IgE-mast cell axis.
Type II-III hypersensitivity: Leads to antibody-specific and immune-complex-mediated effects.
Type IV or delayed hypersensitivity: There is marked epithelial and sub-epithelial oedema and infiltration by CD4+ lymphocytes and cells of Langerhans.


Diagnostic tests:
Most tests are not practical or not widely available and are difficult to perform in the clinical set up.

Conjunctival Scraping: The presence of eosinophils and basophils on conjunctival scrapings points to an allergic reaction but it is relatively non-specific, since these cells can also be found in toxic keratoconjunctivitis. In clinical setting, this test is most often used to rule out infectious disease and allergy.
Conjunctival Biopsy: Conjunctival biopsies are reserved for confirmation or exclusion of autoimmune diseases and are usually reserved for the diagnosis of cicatrising conjunctivitis (e.g. pemphigoid). Patients, after long-term glaucoma treatment, may show squamous metaplasia of the conjunctival epithelium and sub-conjunctival inflammation and fibrosis.
Impression Cytology: Impression Cytology provides a homogeneous cell layer for histological studies. Epithelial cells, goblet cells and inflammatory cells can be differentiated with immune-staining and can even be used for flow cytometry analysis, which allows measurement of membrane and cytoplasmic inflammatory markers.
Tear analysis: Tear samples can be used to measure levels of IgE or inflammatory cytokines, though they are rarely used except for research purposes.

When tear samples are positive, skin tests and conjunctival allergen challenge may be of clinical value, but negative findings do not rule out allergy.
Toxicity of common ophthalmic preparations:
Glaucoma medications:
Patients with glaucoma frequently require topical treatment for many years to control intraocular pressure. Like all ophthalmic medications, any anti-glaucoma drop may initiate sudden allergic response. However, patients may develop a late onset reaction, appearing months or even decades after treatment. Patients present with foreign body sensation, conjunctival hyperaemia, and staining of the conjunctiva with fluorescein sodium and rose Bengal. Topical anti-glaucoma medications have been shown to reduce density of superficial epithelial cells and increase tear film break-up time (BUT). Severe cases may induce sub-conjunctival fibrosis and a pseudo-pemphigoid syndrome. Long term therapy may induce subclinical inflammation and increased postoperative fibrosis; hence, the long-term use of topical anti-glaucoma drugs may be an important risk factor for the failure of filtration surgery. Care of ocular surface and reduction of inflammation before surgery may be achieved, whenever possible.
Specific glaucoma medications can be associated with certain clinical manifestations. Pilocarpine and beta-blockers have been associated with follicular conjunctivitis and drug-induced pemphigoid. Beta-blockers have also been found to produce pseudo-dendrites and corneal hypo-aesthesia. Both epinephrine and dipivefrin may also induce a follicular reaction. Epinephrine is associated with pigmented adenochrome deposits in the conjunctiva. Alfa-2-adrenergic agonists may produce an acute allergic blepharoconjunctivitis.
Preservatives:
Preservatives are antiseptic substances formulated with the principal compound of eye-drops to prevent microbial contamination.
Multi-dose eye drops contain antimicrobial preservatives. Many substances have been used for this purpose, including benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorbutanol, thiomersal, paraben esters, and mercuric salts. Preservatives are probably the most common cause of toxic keratoconjunctivitis. Repeated application of multiple medications may lead to significant accumulation of preservative in ocular (eye) tissue and thus, increased risk of ocular damage. Toxicity is more common in patients taking preserved medications as compared to those taking preservative-free eye drops.
Benzalkonium chloride can disrupt tear film by detergent action, cause epithelial toxicity and irreversible corneal oedema. Thiomersal is a common cause of hypersensitivity reaction and follicular conjunctivitis. Chlorobutanol is an alcohol that increases lipid solubility and is normally well tolerated and has been found to be less toxic than benzalkonium chloride or thiomersal.
Anaesthetics:
Anaesthetics are inappropriately used by patients to relieve pain, but the action is short-lived and the drug may be easily abused. The indiscriminate use of topical anaesthetics is a well known cause of toxic keratoconjunctivitis. Proparacaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, cornecaine, and benoxinate, all have been associated with toxicity. Patient may have clinical features such as pain, swelling of lids, conjunctival hyperaemia or mucopurulent discharge. The most frequent manifestation is superficial keratopathy, which can be detected even after instillation of a single drop. More severe cases can have corneal ulceration and stromal necrosis. Toxic lesions are due to decreased blinking reflexes, tear film instability with loss of epithelial microvilli, and corneal desiccation. Anaesthetics interfere with cell metabolism, cell membrane permeability, alter function of cytoskeletal proteins, and decrease the rate of epithelial wound healing.
Topical Antibiotics:
Topical antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis and keratitis. The most used antibiotics are topical amino-glycosides and fluoroquinolones, followed by sulphonamides, macrolides, and chloramphenicol.
Amino-glycosides, such as gentamicin and tobramycin can produce conjunctival and corneal hypersensitivity, pruritus and hyperaemia. Toxic effects of topical fluoroquinolones, even of the first generations, are less common than those produced by amino-glycosides. The most common corneal finding is a white crystalline precipitate after the use of ciprofloxacin. However, epithelial toxicity, due to the preservative benzalkonium chloride present in topical gatifloxacin, can occur. Suphonamides may produce mild allergic reaction. The most devastating complication of sulphonamides is the induction of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Photosensitisation after topical sulfisoxazole ointment use may cause sunburn of the lid margin.
Topical antivirals:
All antiviral medicines may cause toxic keratoconjunctivitis to some extent. Idoxuridine may produce punctate epitheliopathy, erosions and epithelial oedema on cornea. In conjunctiva, it causes follicular response, subconjunctival scarring and may occlude punctum. Similar effects, but to a lesser degree, may be caused by trifluorothymidine and vidarabine.
Topical antifungals:
Antifungals used in topical preparations may impair epithelial healing. Natamycin, the most commonly used anti-fungal agent, is generally non-irritating.
Miscellaneous toxic agents:
Almost all topical treatment, given enough time and frequency of use, may be associated with toxicity. One must be aware that substances other than approved medications may be in contact with the ocular surface. Substances such as mascara, eyeliner, hair gel, hair sprays, skin preparations, and virtually any substance with direct or indirect contact with the body may produce toxicity. Many a times, patients use home-prepared remedies for common eye complaints, and are often reluctant to disclose these.
Toxic keratoconjunctivitis should be differentiated from conditions such as:

Allergic conjunctivitis.
Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid: Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is characterised by auto-antibodies directed against adhesion molecules in epithelial membrane complex. It leads to chronic ocular cicatricial conjunctivitis, besides affecting skin and other mucous membranes. There may be subconjunctival fibrosis, symblepharon formation, fornix foreshortening or punctal occlusion.
Pseudo-pemphigoid: Pseudo-pemphigoid is a severe toxic scarring reaction of the ocular surface, similar to ocular ciactricial pemphigoid. Unlike ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, investigations fail to show any auto-antibodies in the conjunctiva.
Factitious disease: Factitious disease is an intentional disease produced by patient.
Conjunctivitis medicamentosa: Conjunctivitis medicamentosa (medicamentosa is a potentially prolonged inflammatory state that can last for several weeks or months of rebound mucosal congestion) is caused by overuse of topical vasoconstrictors. It presents with increase in conjunctival congestion and rebound hyperaemia on discontinuation of medicine. (‘conjunctivitis medicamentosa’) (Spector S &amp; Raizman M (1994): Conjunctivitis medicamentosa. J Allergy Clin Immunol 94: 134–136.).","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Ocular surface toxicity is related to concentration, frequency and duration of administration of drug, while allergy does not have such relationship.
Management of Toxic keratoconjunctivitis depends on the time of exposure and severity of the ocular surface disease.
General measures:

Discontinuation of the offending toxic agent: Primary therapeutic strategy is the discontinuation of the offending toxic agent. Attempts should be made to stop medications or to substitute them with less toxic or preservative-free formulations. Contact lens wear, if required, should be used cautiously, since they can act as a toxic reservoir.
Cold compresses: Cold compresses may be soothing and may help in ocular irritation.

Medical therapy:

Preservative free artificial tears: For mild disease, a preservative free artificial tear may be used for symptomatic relief.
Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids may be needed for more symptomatic patients.

Surgical therapy:
Patients may require surgical measures, for complications and sequlae, such as:

Tarsorrhaphy: Tarsorrhaphy may be required for persistent corneal epithelial defects.
Conjunctival flap: Conjunctival flap is an alternative for persistent epithelial defects of cornea.
Amniotic membrane grafting: Amniotic membrane grafting may be beneficial in covering epithelial defects, thereby promoting corneal healing.
Keratoplasty: Keratoplasty may be required for impending corneal perforation or necrosis.


Prognosis:
Toxic keratoconjunctivitis is usually non sight-threatening. Overall time taken for resolution of drug reactions and clinical improvement may be prolonged."
Thermal Injuries to the Eye,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/thermal-injuries-to-the-eye,"Thermal injuries to the eye are potentially blinding eye injuries and constitute true emergencies. Thermal injuries to the eye are less common than chemical injuries, with very different forms of ocular insult, post-injury problems, and treatment approaches.
Thermal injuries are of importance due to increased occurrence during festival and festivities.
Thermal injuries and Festival/ Festivity in India:
Diwali (Deepavali): Diwali is an important Indian festival celebrated by lighting lamps and bursting crackers. Diwali festival also marks end of month Ashwin and beginning of Kartik month of Indian calendar, and it falls in the month of October or November every year.
Firecrackers are extensively used during festivals and festivities in India. Fireworks are used during celebrations because of sound produced, sparkle and sudden burst of colours. Whenever firecrackers are used, there is always a risk of burn and injury. Crackers also cause noise/ air pollution and may aggravate systemic diseases like bronchial asthma.
The chemicals released by the firecrackers are also harmful. Chemicals in fireworks include sulphur dioxide, lead, cadmium, copper, magnesium, nitrate and nitrite.
Firecrackers release chemical pollutants such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
Magnesium hydroxide is found in sparklers and flares; the combination of thermal injury and chemical injury accounts for more severe injury than that being produced by either type alone.
Facial burns are a frequent component of thermal injury and ocular involvement may be a part of it in some patients. The lids, especially the margins, are selectively protected from burns. This is because protractor spasm causes orbital and preseptal tissue to overlap and cover the tarsal region. The incidence of lid involvement is increased with more extensive burns. This is especially true when patients are unconscious secondary to an explosion or smoke inhalation and the protective reflexes are not intact. Fortunately, thermal injury is not commonly associated with severe ocular sequelae, courtesy of inherent protective mechanism, such as blink reflex, Bell’s phenomenon, and reflex shielding movements of the head and arms. The loss of an eye primarily from thermal trauma is uncommon and the risk of permanent visual impairment can be minimised with effective timely treatment. Involvement of the eyelids and lid margins is the most frequent ophthalmic manifestation. With thermal injury, eyelid damage leads to necrosis of tissues, eschar formation, and, finally, quantitative loss of tissue. Therefore, the eyelid and conjunctival support system of the cornea is compromised, further embarrassing any corneal or anterior segment pathology. Chronic exposure keratitis is one of the greatest threats to corneal integrity and visual rehabilitation. However, ocular trauma may occur in the absence of eyelid injury and all patients who have been exposed to fumes, heat and smoke warrant comprehensive eye examination.
Direct thermal damage to the cornea produces collagen shrinkage, with prominent stress lines radiating away from the area of greatest injury, especially in case of hot metal contact to the surface. This shrinkage might be severe enough to make the cornea distorted and opaque, leading to steepening of the axis of severest injury. Collagen damage may be so severe as to produce a rapidly excavating corneal ulcer originating from liquefactive necrosis. The post-injury phases of thermal injuries have not been studied as comprehensively as chemical injuries.
When both thermal and chemical injuries occur simultaneously, the terms ‘thermal-alkali injury’ or ‘alkali-thermal injury’ might be used, with the most prominent injurious agent stated first. Thermal injuries associated with acid injuries may be referred to in a similar way.","Symptoms may include:

Severe pain.
Red eyes.
Watering or epiphora.
Foreign body sensation.
Blurring of vision.
Reduced visual acuity.
Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light).
Blepharospasm.

In massive thermal burns, patient may require systemic resuscitation.","Thermal injuries result from accidents associated with firework explosion, steam, boiling water, or molten metal. Thermal burns include those caused by a flame, which are usually severe with deep tissue injury, and those caused by flash accidents, such as explosions or electrical arcs, which are usually more superficial but may be extensive. The thermal injury is immediate and non-progressive.
The majority of ocular thermal injuries can be divided into:

Flame burns: Flame burns are secondary to fire. They tend to be deep dermal or full thickness.
Scalds: Scalds may be caused by spilling hot drinks or liquids or being exposed to hot bathing water. Scalds tend to cause superficial to superficial dermal burns.
Contact burns: Contact burns are the result of direct exposure to a hot object. Contact burns tend to be deep dermal or full thickness.

The severity of burns depends upon the intensity of the burning agent, both the quantity of heat transmitted by the burning agent and amount of the burning agent, the duration of exposure, use of protective device, body response, any first aid or irrigation of the affected eye.
Most of the flash burns are superficial but may be extensive. In burns due to flames, the period of exposure is longer and it results in deep burns.
Liquid thermal burns vary in severity depending on the substance. Injury due to steam and also due to explosion of liquids on removal from microwave may splash into the eye and cause burns. The temperature of non- combustible liquid like water is usually less on body contact, and such liquids dissipate rapidly from the initial contact area, thereby causing superficial burns only. The temperature of combustible liquids (e.g. petrol), is usually high on contact with the body. These liquids are more viscous and may burn the clothes as well. Therefore, the damage is more localised but may be deep.

Pathophysiology:
Eyelid injury:
The skin is made up of two layers:

Superficial epidermis.
Deeper thicker dermal layer.

These layers cover the subcutaneous tissues and a deeper muscular layer.
Jackson (1953) described three zones of burn:

Zone of coagulation: Zone of coagulation occurs at the point of maximum damage. There is irreversible tissue loss due to coagulation of the constituent proteins. Tissue in this zone must be débrided. The zone of coagulation is surrounded by the zone of stasis.
Zone of stasis: The surrounding zone of stasis is characterised by decreased tissue perfusion due to vasoconstriction and ischaemia. The tissue in this zone is potentially salvageable. The zone of stasis is surrounded by zone of hyperaemia.
Zone of hyperaemia: In this outermost zone of hyperaemia, tissue perfusion is increased due to vasodilatation. The tissue in this zone typically remains viable. The tissue here invariably recovers unless there is severe sepsis or prolonged hypo-perfusion.

These three zones of burn are three dimensional, and loss of tissue in the zone of stasis will lead to the wound deepening as well as widening.
Healing process of eyelid thermal injuries:
Re-epithelialisation of wounds occurs from epithelium located at wound edges and skin appendages. In large epithelial defects, granulation tissue bridges the wound before epithelialisation. Wound contraction takes place in second- and third-degree burns and aids in restoring epithelial continuity. The property of wound contraction distorts the eyelids and hampers their function. Owing to the thinness of skin and absence of subcutaneous fat and rich blood supply, the slough on the lid separates early. The raw surface needs to be grafted, if contraction of wound is to be avoided.

Adjacent soft tissue injuries (e.g. cheek, forehead): In adjacent soft tissue injuries, skin contraction displaces the eyelids which might pull the canthus. Injuries affecting lower lid tends to be more severe, due to less available loose skin.

Thermal ocular injury:
The severity of thermal ocular injury is a function of the thermal dose and the surface area of contact. A thermal dose can be defined by a time-temperature relationship. Goldblatt et al. explored the limits of thermal tolerance in animal models, by applying well-defined heat doses (time x temperature) and examined the effects on the tissue. They found that a heat dose of 45˚ celsius resulted in no perceptible damage to the cornea when applied for 15 minutes, and produced mild transient stromal oedema only when applied for 45 minutes.
Higher thermal exposure produced damage with total destruction of cellular elements, massive oedema and stromal disorganisation at a temperature of 59˚ celsius for 45 minutes. This degree of thermal exposure resulted in severe degeneration of all structures and total necrosis at one week.

Thermal injuries to the conjunctiva may be iatrogenic sometimes e.g. after the use of triple freeze- thaw technique during removal of conjunctival tumours. Thermal response includes:


- Initial phase: Initial phase comprises of tissue destruction.
- An interval reactive phase.
- Period of tissue repair.

Minor thermal injuriesare typically limited to the conjunctival epithelium. Migration of peripheral epithelial cells then heals the ulceration with no scarring. Deeper injuries involve the stromal connective tissue and may cause coagulation necrosis. The healing process is prolonged and may result in significant scarring.
Aberrant wound healingmay result in a vascularised, hypertrophic scar that mimics a pterygium, but it usually lacks the stromal elastosis as seen in pterygium. This scar may encroach on the corneal surface like a pterygium.
Excessive wound healingmay also result in a so-called pyogenic granuloma. This rapidly growing and protruding lesion is histologically defined by vascularised, oedematous granulation tissue with abundance of inflammatory cells.
The lining epithelium may be eroded, and pyogenic granuloma may bleed intermittently.


In thermal injuries to the cornea, actual burn to the surface is rare, but the injury is usually secondary to exposure, drying, and infection due to deep eyelid burns and is, therefore, preventable. In severe thermal burns, there is corneal opacification associated with extensive and deep damage to the tissues. Direct thermal damage to the cornea produces collagen shrinkage, with prominent stress lines. This shrinkage might be severe enough to make the cornea distorted, leading to steepening of the axis of severest injury. Collagen damage may be so severe as to produce a rapidly excavating corneal ulcer originating from liquefactive necrosis. Globe rupture is seen in extreme cases.","Patients with ocular thermal trauma should undergo early evaluation of the eye to assess the extent of the injury and exclude the possibility of an intraocular or intraorbital foreign body. The frequency of eye examination must balance the risk of ocular sequelae with the risk of contamination.
Diagnosis requires:
Examination of eyelids and adjacent tissues:

The depth and extent of burns in the eyelids and adjacent areas should be assessed initially.
The presence or absence of eyebrow hair and eyelashes should be well documented. Presence of these indicates sparing of the eyelid margin. Loss of these is associated with a deep partial-thickness or full-thickness burn.
Bell’s phenomenon: Bell’s phenomenon is a protective reflex in which eyeball is seen turned upwards and slightly outwards during eyelid closure to avoid corneal exposure. The presence or absence of Bell’s phenomenon should be documented. In the presence of a partial- thickness burn, eyelid contracture produces progressive lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids completely) and corneal exposure. A good Bell’s phenomenon may help prevent a corneal epithelial defect even in the presence of significant lagophthalmos. Absence of Bell’s phenomenon may cause increased conjunctival redness, chemosis, corneal exposure, or mucous discharge and needs prompt surgery.
Foreign bodies, if any.

Burns are categorised into degrees depending on the depth and extent of injury.
Degrees of burns:

Epidermal burns (First-degree burns): Epidermal burns (First-degree burns) involve the epidermis. First-degree burn usually does not produce any deformity. Pain is due to local vasodilator prostaglandins, and healing is usually complete within a week.
Partial-thickness burns (Second-degree burns): Partial-thickness burns (Second-degree burns) include injury to the dermis, formation of blisters, and swelling. There is subcuticular or dermal fibrosis with sparing of orbicularis oculi muscle fibers. Partial-thickness burns are commonly divided into superficial and deep.

Superficial partial-thickness burns affect epidermis and superficial dermis and results in thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters with a moist red base. The exposure of superficial nerves makes these injuries painful. Burn usually heals spontaneously within two weeks without significant scarring or with minimal scarring only.
Deep partial-thickness burns have a pale white or mottled base beneath the blisters. Healing takes three or more weeks, and is accompanied by scarring and contraction. Deeper second-degree burn leads to scar formation and contracture of wound, producing ectropion. These often necessitate early surgery for contraction and eyelid retraction.

Full-thickness burns (Third-degree burns): Full- thickness burns (Third-degree burns) destroy epidermis, dermis, and all regenerative elements. There may be involvement of deeper structures as well. The skin is dry, leathery, and affected tissue is avascular and white. In the lids this appearance may be followed by oedema of the underlying tissues. The wound heals from the edges by eschar formation, followed by proliferation of granulation tissue and marked wound contraction, which may cause more severe ectropion and lid shortening. Such burns are typically painless due to loss of sensation in the involved area. Early excision of the affected tissue and skin grafting is almost always required to cover burnt area, which prevents secondary corneal complications.

Some advocate full-thickness burns with destruction of underlying muscle, bone and vital structures, separately as deep burns (Fourth-degree burns). Such burns require extensive and complex management and often result in severe contracture and prolonged disability.
Based on degrees and the likelihood of surgery, eyelid burns may be classified as:

Minimal burns: Minimal burns are superficial partial-thickness burns that usually heal and do not require any surgery.
Moderate burns: Moderate burns refer to deep partial-thickness burns that show delayed healing but may not require surgery.
Major burns: Major burns are deep partial- or full-thickness burns and invariably require early surgery with skin grafting.

Exposure keratitis with or without secondary infection leads to conjunctival and corneal damage producing corneal opacities and, in severe cases, there may be destruction of globe.
Ocular surface examination:
Eyes should be examined under slit lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist.
Examination of eyes should be done as early as possible since eyelid usually swells and shut the eyes. Most ocular thermal injuries result in superficial burns to the cornea or conjunctiva.
Conjunctiva: Conjunctival oedema, if present, may be due to conjunctival surface burn, mild exposure, or due to fluid resuscitation. Look for any loss of conjunctiva due to burns. Involvement of both palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva may lead to formation of symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva).
Cornea: Cornea may be examined under slit lamp after instilling fluorescein dye. Corneal injury is usually secondary to exposure, drying, and infection due to deep eyelid burns.
Initial assessment should note corneal sensation in order to appraise the risk of corneal ulceration from corneal exposure. There may be corneal thinning due to lagophthalmos.

Superficial injury produces a spectrum of damage to epithelium ranging from minor punctate changes, to widespread loss of epithelium.
In severe thermal burns, there is corneal opacification associated with extensive and deep damage to the tissues and it may result in stromal scarring. The resultant eschar eventually sloughs off, leaving a thin corneal tissue which is susceptible to corneal ectasia. Direct thermal damage to the cornea produces collagen shrinkage, with prominent stress lines. Collagen damage may lead to a rapidly excavating corneal ulcer originating from liquefactive necrosis. Globe rupture is seen in extreme cases.

Intraocular pressure monitoring and direct ophthalmoscopy is also required.
Extent of tissue damage is a prognostic indicator of recovery following ocular surface injury. Extent of damage to corneal, limbal, conjunctival tissues and intraocular structures influences the visual outcome and may be classified as:

Classification of ocular surface burns:
Dua (2001) provides a classification of ocular surface burns giving prognosis based on corneal appearance, conjunctival involvement and analogue scale recording the amount of limbal involvement in clock hours of affected limbus/ percentage of conjunctival involvement. The conjunctival involvement should be calculated only for the bulbar conjunctiva, up to and including the conjunctival fornices.

Grade I: In Grade I, there is 0 clock hours of limbal involvement, 0% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0/0%, and the prognosis is very good.
Grade II: In Grade II, there is less than 3 clock hours of limbal involvement, less than 30% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0.1- 3/ 1- 29.9%, and the prognosis is good.
Grade III: In Grade III, there is between 3- 6 clock hours of limbal involvement, 30- 50% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 3.1- 6/ 31- 50%, and the prognosis is good.
Grade IV: In Grade IV, there is between 6- 9 clock hours of limbal involvement, 50- 75% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 6.1- 9/ 51- 75%, and the prognosis is good to guarded.
Grade V: In Grade V, there is between 9- 12 clock hours of limbal involvement, 75- 100% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 9.1- 11.9/ 75- 100%, and the prognosis is guarded to poor.
Grade VI: In Grade VI, there is total limbal (12 clock hours) involvement, total conjunctival (100%) involvement, analogue scale reading of 12/ 100%, and the prognosis is very poor.


Hughes (1946) classification (modified by Ballen in 1963, Roper- Hall in 1965 and Pfister et al in 1982) provides a prognostic guideline based on corneal appearance and extent of limbal ischaemia. The Roper-hall classification system was introduced in the mid-1960s and is the most established and commonly applied system.

Grade I injury: In Grade I injury, there is corneal epithelial damage, no corneal opacity, no limbal ischaemia, and the prognosis is good.
Grade II injury: In Grade II injury, the cornea is hazy but the iris details are visible. There is also ishaemia involving less than one third of the limbus and the prognosis is good.
Grade III injury: In Grade III injury, there is total epithelial loss, stromal haze with obscuration of iris details, ischaemia of one third to one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is guarded.
Grade IV injury: In Grade IV injury, the cornea is opaque with no view of the iris or pupil, the ischaemia is greater than one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is poor.


Differential diagnosis:

Chemical injuries to the eyes.
Ultraviolet radiation keratitis.
Other causes of corneal opacification.
Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Thermal injuries can be devastating from both functional and psychological aspect to the patient. Complications of injuries may be minimised with prompt and adequate treatment. Barring severe and worst injuries, globe and good vision may be saved in most of the cases. Management is directed towards preserving the eye and vision, maintaining function, and restoration of cosmesis.
Any co-existing systemic inhalational burn injury should be treated.
Management of eyelids:
Medical therapy:
Immediate management of thermal injuries requires:

Removal of any dirt and debris.
Gentle removal of sloughed skin.
Cold, moist compresses.

Subsequent management:

Trimming of eyelashes: Singed eyelashes in thermal eyelid burn should be trimmed to avoid the possibility of char falling in the eye causing ocular surface discomfort. Blades of scissors may be covered with an eye ointment in order to prevent cut eyelashes from falling in the eye.
Management of wound:

For mild first degree burns, cold compresses may be required in cases with significant eyelid swelling and drooping. Eyelid burns with no eyelid contraction may be treated conservatively with an antibiotic ointment.
Second- and third-degree burns with significant retraction causing lagophthalmos may require moist chamber or cellophane occlusion. If surrounding skin is severely burnt, surgical suture tarsorrhaphy may be done. Suture tarsorrhaphy is a temporary measure and may not prevent eyelid retraction. Suture tarsorrhaphy is not a substitute for eyelid repair with skin grafting.
Severe third-degree burns of the eyelids may require surgical relaxing incision over the burn eschar to release the cicatrising ectropion.
Surgical therapy:

Temporary suture tarsorrhaphy: Temporary suture tarsorrhaphy is useful and effective in the presence of lagophthalmos caused by severe burn of the eyelid skin.
Surgical tarsorrhaphy: Surgical tarsorrhaphy may be done at about two weeks when eyelid contracture usually occurs. It does not appear to prevent wound contraction where cicatricial ectropion is present. A combined lateral tarsorrhaphy with a skin graft produces good results. Since the risk of ectropion persists for months due to persistent eyelid shrinkage, a tarsorrhaphy should remain in place till the facial scar matures.
Masquerade procedure: Masquerade procedure may be done to close the eye until further reconstruction, in severely damaged eyelids where no viable adjacent skin or tissue exists. All necrotic tissue including orbicularis oculi muscle and eyelid margins are excised and a conjunctival flap from the remaining upper and lower eyelid tarsal or bulbar conjunctiva is mobilised and sutured together. A split thickness skin graft is then applied to cover the entire eyelid area.
Split-thickness dermal graft: Split-thickness dermal graft is an alternative in the presence of large corneal and scleral defects which cannot be covered by conjunctival flaps. The graft may be harvested from the thigh.
Eyelid graft: Eyelid graft when applied in acute stage needs to be repeated several times, as a split skin graft contracts as compared to full thickness graft. If a thick skin graft is applied when all reaction to burns has subsided, one stage grafting suffices as the effect of contracting scars of adjacent tissues is minimised.

If both upper and lower eyelid requires grafting, to maximise the stretched graft bed for each eyelid, grafting is performed at separate times. The lower eyelid is operated first followed by upper eyelid.
Management of complications and sequelae of eyelids: The eyelids are evaluated at a later stage for retraction, tear pump function and cosmetic appearance.

Trichiasis: Repeated electrolysis or epilation of trichiatic cilia may be required.
Lagophthalmos: Lagophthalmos may be corrected by lower eyelid sling procedure.
Medial or lateral canthus deformities: Multiple Z plasties or local transposition flaps may be required.
Eyelid defects:

- Eyelid defect involving up to 1/3rd of the eyelid may be closed directly.
- Defects involving 1/3rd to 1/2 of the eyelid may be corrected by Tenzel’s semicircular rotation flap.
- Defects involving more than 1/2 of the lower eyelid may be corrected by modified Hughes procedure (tarsal-conjunctival flap).
- Defects involving more than 1/2 of the upper eyelid may be corrected by sliding tarsal-conjunctival flap (variation of modified Hughes procedure).
- Defects involving entire lower eyelid may be reconstructed by Mustardé cheek rotation flap.
- Large central defects of the upper eyelid may require Cutler- Beard procedure involving full thickness segment of the lower eyelid.


Palpebral aperture stenosis: Cicatricial eyelid margins in full thickness eyelid burns causing palpebral aperture stenosis may require incisional release to relieve it.
Canalicular obstruction: Burns around medial canthus may involve punctum and canaliculus. Daily puntal probing, punctoplasty and canaliculoplasty are the options.
Eyebrow deformities: Depending upon the depth of the burn, eyebrow deformities may require a full thickness composite graft of hair bearing skin from temporo-parietal region.
Scar revision: Scar revision with laser or surgical means may be required.


Management of ocular surface:
Preparation for vision restoration: Preparation for vision restoration must begin immediately after the injury. Deliberate and timely treatment determines successful outcomes in the rehabilitative process.
In succession, management consists of emergency treatment, pressure control, suppression of inflammation, enhancing stromal repair, and establishing eyelid-globe congruity during the early days, weeks, and months after the injury.
Topical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and topical beta blockers continue to form the mainstay of intraocular pressure control. Fibroblast inhibiting mitomycin C may improve the success of filtration surgery for glaucoma. Drainage procedures may be done if one or more filtration surgeries fail.
Operative procedures for ocular surface include amniotic membrane transplant, corneal epithelial stem cell transplants, keratoplasty, large-diameter lamellar keratoplasty, and keratoprosthesis.
Medical therapy:
Emergency management:

Irrigation of eyes: Emergency management requires prompt irrigation and the removal of residual debris from the eye. Irrigation cools the ocular surface and removes any inflammatory substance. Any available neutral irrigation solution may be used in emergency. Solutions available for irrigation include normal saline, normal saline with bicarbonate, Ringer’s lactate, balanced salt solution (BSS), and BSS- plus. No therapeutic differences have been noted among these solutions. After copious irrigation, necrotic corneal epithelium should be débrided to promote re-epithelialisation. Where possible, topical anaesthetic drops should be instilled to reduce pain and blepharospasm, thereby facilitating irrigation.


Acute and reparative phases:
After irrigation, better outcomes may be expected with prompt re-epithelialisation, while delayed or absent re-epithelialisation may require surgical intervention.

Topical artificial tears: Topical artificial tears may be used as lubricant to the ocular surface to counter the effects of lagophthalmos.
Topical antibiotics: Topical antibiotics may be used for any epithelial defects to prevent any secondary infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common gram-negative organism which may infect the affected cornea.


Surgical therapy:
Surgical intervention that may help stabilising the ocular surface in severe thermal injury includes:

Tenonplasty: Tenonplasty attempts to re-establish limbal vascularity in severe injuries and to promote re- epithelialisation. In this, all necrotic conjunctival and episcleral tissues are excised. Tenon’s capsule is dissected with blunt instrument, and the resultant flap with its preserved blood supply is advanced to the limbus.
Tissue adhesives (tissue glue): Tissue adhesives preserve integrity in the event of corneal thinning with impending or actual perforation of the globe. This is usually accompanied by the application of a soft bandage contact lens, which prevents glue dislodgement. Tissue glue can stop further melting by excluding inflammatory cells and their mediators. Tissue adhesives also provide a means of delaying penetrating keratoplasty.
Amniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation may be used as supplement to surgical procedures where coverage of raw surfaces or suppression of inflammation is required. Amniotic membrane has anti-angiogenic (inhibitors of blood vessels growth) and anti-inflammatory proteins capable of suppressing the inflammatory response. Amniotic membrane can create a new basement membrane and promote epithelial healing. Amniotic membrane might be applied after a thermal injury following emergency services, usually weeks later. Despite benefits, amniotic membrane cannot replace the need for corneal stem cells.
Corneal stem cell transplantation: Replacement of the corneal stem cells lost due to injury is important in restoration of an intact and normal corneal epithelial cell layer. These primitive, slow-cycling stem cells are located in the limbal area.

Monocular injuries allow for procurement of stem cells from the uninjured eye. When the injury is bilateral, Pfister (1993) showed that allografted limbal tissue was capable of restoring the stem cell population from an unrelated donor. Allografted corneal stem cells must be protected from the recipient immune process by systemic immune-suppression e.g. with cyclosporine.

Corneal transplantation (Keratoplasty):

       Success in restorative corneal surgery is governed by:
- Lid-globe congruity with normal blinking and the absence of corneal exposure. Preparatory procedures to lyse symblepharon, expand cul-de-sacs, and to eliminate lagophthalmos are often required to re-establish normal lid functioning.
- Quality and quantity of tear film.
- The presence of epithelial stem cells phenotypic for cornea.
- The absence of any current ulceration, inflammation, and/or uncontrolled glaucoma. Secondary glaucoma must also be controlled with medications or filtration surgery.
- Flawless surgical technique.
- Fresh corneal transplant tissue.
The value of preoperative use of LASER for blood vessels at the limbus in high-risk patients is controversial, but at least it reduces bleeding at the time of surgery.
If corneal surgery is delayed 18 months to 2 years after a burn, it increases the chances of success, especially in the absence of pre-existing ulceration, perforation, or glaucoma.
Penetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty refers to the full- thickness replacement of the affected cornea with a healthy donor. Penetrating keratoplasty may be used to provide tectonic support (such as in corneal thinning and perforation), and to improve visual outcome (such as in the replacement of corneal scarring).
Large-diameter penetrating keratoplasty: Replacement of the entire cornea and adjacent stem cells by large-diameter penetrating keratoplasty may be performed. One potential danger might be that such large transplants might interfere with the trabecular outflow channels and hence increase the likelihood of glaucoma. Proximity to the limbal blood vessels makes an immune rejection more likely.
Large-diameter lamellar keratoplasty: A very promising technique in corneal transplantation for injuries includes the use of 12 or 13 mm lamellar corneal transplants, along with the limbal epithelial stem cell population. Smaller lamellar transplants are useful to fill in deep corneal ulcerations, descemetoceles, or frank corneal perforations.

Keratoprosthesis (Artificial cornea): In the most severe cases, implantation of a keratoprosthesis (e.g. Boston keratoprosthesis) might afford the only means by which vision can be restored.

Indications for keratoprosthesis are:
- Corneas exhibiting exuberant vascularity.
- Repeated failures of fresh transplanted corneal tissue.
- Chronic limbal stem cell deficiency.
- Inability to restore normal lid anatomy.
The operation is usually advised in patients with severe bilateral injuries where serviceable vision is not present in either eye. A surprising degree of success may be achieved with keratoprosthesis. Critical to the visual outcome of a keratoprosthesis is the control of intraocular pressure at all times after the injury. Complications of keratoprosthesis include corneal melt, infection, glaucoma and formation of retro-prosthetic membrane.

Conjunctival transplantation: Conjunctival transplantation is a means of restoring conjunctival fornices following fibrosis. This provides compatible tissue with a basement membrane, unlike other mucosal replacements. The procedure involves taking a sample of upper bulbar conjunctiva from the contra-lateral (other uninvolved) eye.
Buccal and Nasal mucosa transplant: Buccal mucosa grafts may be used to treat symblepharon (adhesion between bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva), trichiasis (misdirected eyelashes), distichiasis (partial or complete second row of eyelashes), or entropion. The graft is usually obtained from the posterior aspect of the upper or lower lip. The advantage of nasal mucosal grafts lies in the ability to obtain large sized grafts.


Prognosis:
The prognosis for severe injury is typically poor and may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium, cornea and anterior segment. However, in recent years, the prognosis of severe ocular burns has improved, with advances in the understanding of the physiology of the cornea and the resultant development of enhanced medical and surgical treatments. The final visual prognosis is influenced by:

The extent of ocular damage.
The timing and efficacy of treatment."
Terrien's Marginal Degeneration,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/terrien-s-marginal-degeneration,"Terrien’s Marginal Degeneration (TMD) is a slowly progressive, bilateral, peripheral corneal thinning disorder associated with corneal neovascularisation, opacification and lipid deposition. The disease is usually bilateral but may initially present in one eye. The cause of Terrien’s marginal degeneration is not known and patients may have high degrees of astigmatism. Up to about one third of patients may have associated episcleral or scleral inflammation. Patients are typically between 20-40 years of age, although it may present in childhood or in older people (age ranges from 10 to 70 years). It is more common in men than in women.
Terrien (1900) first described this disorder. The condition is usually bilateral and starts in the superonasal quadrant as a fine, yellow- white punctate stromal opacity that may progress along the circumference of the cornea.
Two types of Terrien’s marginal degeneration have been documented. One type occurs primarily in the older population. It is usually asymptomatic and slowly progressive. The other, more inflammatory type characteristically occurs in younger patients and may be associated with episcleritis or scleritis. It has also been reported in patients with posterior polymorphous dystrophy, anterior basement membrane dystrophy, and erythema elevatum diutinum (rare chronic dermatosis).
Marked astigmatism may be corrected initially with spectacle or contact lenses. Surgical intervention may be required to correct visually disabling astigmatism, prevent impending perforation, and to treat corneal perforation.","Patients are asymptomatic with initial mild disease.
Patient with advanced disease may have symptoms such as:

Painless progressive blurred vision.
Progressive change of glasses.

Less common symptoms may be:

Recurrent attacks of ocular irritation.
Pseudo-pterygium.","The cause of Terrien’s marginal degeneration remains unknown. There are two types:

Classic form: The classic form most commonly affects patients older than 40 years of age without rheumatoid arthritis and progression is extremely slow.
Inflammatory type: Inflammatory variant of Terrien’s marginal degeneration affects younger subjects and it is characterised by recurrent and disabling attacks of acute pain and inflammation.


Pathogenesis:
Terrien’s bilaterality, extremely slow progression, lack of significant clinical and histological inflammation, and lipid deposition suggests a degenerative process in most cases.
The inflammatory form showed perivascular lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltration, vascular occlusion, and fibrinoid necrosis. Austin and Brown (1981) described an inflammatory type in younger subjects. However, later they stated that the description of central progression with epithelial breakdown were more consistent with Mooren’s ulcer rather than with Terrien’s marginal degeneration.
Terrien’s marginal degeneration may be associated with:

Episcleritis.
Scleritis.
Posterior polymorphous dystrophy.
Keratoconus.
Anterior basement membrane dystrophy.
Erythema elevatum diutinum (rare chronic dermatosis characterised by red- brown papules and nodules on extensor surfaces).","The diagnosis of Terrien’s marginal degeneration is clinical, based on history, slit lamp (bio-microscopy) examination of the eye, and corneal topography.
The disease process is extremely slow, often taking 30 years. Patients give history of progressive change of glasses with slowly deteriorating vision from severe against-the-rule astigmatism (caused by progressive flattening of the vertical meridian).
Clinical signs:
Terrien’s marginal degeneration usually begins superonasally with peripheral, fine, yellow-white punctate stromal opacities. A lucid zone of clear cornea separates the opacities from the limbus. In due course, the opacities coalesce into a line similar to arcus senilis, superficial vessels advances from the limbus, with thinning of the intervening stroma. The thinning slowly spreads circumferentially and rarely towards the center as well. In advanced stages, localised areas of ectasia develop along the course of corneal thinning. Circumferential ectasia is rare. Epithelium is intact throughout the course of the disease.
Spontaneous breaks in Descemet’s membrane resulting in corneal hydrops have been reported. Corneal hydrops presents as a clear intracorneal pocket of aqueous rather than stromal clouding. Since Bowman’s membrane remains intact, there is corneal intra-lamellar dissection and formation of corneal cysts. Occasionally, intracorneal aqueous pockets become continuous with subconjunctival space with formation of filtering blebs and resultant hypotony. Perforation either spontaneous or following minor trauma may occur, but is rare.
Pseudo-pterygium may develop rarely in some patients with Terrien’s marginal degeneration. The pseudo-pterygium characteristically occurs in positions other than interpalpebral 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock position and grows onto the cornea at an oblique angle. This variant may be the same as Fuch’s superficial marginal keratitis.
Occasionally, Terrien’s may present with recurrent painful episodes of inflammation. Collagen vascular disease should be ruled out.
Salient features are:

High against-the-rule or oblique astigmatism.
Leading edge of lipid.
Steep central edge.
Sloping peripheral edge.
Superficial vascularisation.
Intact epithelium.


Terrien’s marginal degeneration is distinguished from other peripheral corneal thinning disorders by:

Lack of inflammation.
Presence of superficial vascularisation.
Advancing linear deposition of lipid.
Lack of epithelial defect. 
Slow progressive course.


Corneal topography/ Videokeratography: Corneal topography/ Videokeratography measures corneal curvature, elevation and the amount of corneal astigmatism. This also helps in fitting rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Corneal topography reveals flattening over the peripheral areas of corneal thinning. It shows steepening opposite to the mid-point of corneal thinning.
Scanning slit topography: Scanning slit topography utilises optical slits that scan along multiple points of the cornea. This allows for measurements of the anterior and posterior cornea including pachymetry (measures corneal thickness).
Ultrasound biomicroscopy: Ultrasound biomicroscopy quantifies the thickness of the cornea and help to detect progression of disease. Due to its high magnification and ability to depict the size and shape of structures, it can reveal subtle changes in the cornea.

Histopathology:
The epithelium may be normal, thickened, or thinned. Basal epithelial cells show degeneration. Bowman’s membrane and anterior stromal lamella are lost and replaced by vascularised loose connective tissue. Limbal vessels advance centrally within the superficial connective tissue, loop at the central margin of furrow, and revert back to the limbus passing just anterior to Descemet’s layer.
The remaining stromal lamella is compressed and shows lipid deposition. Lipid deposition is most prominent anterior to the vascular arcades. Histiocytes line the blood vessels and contain phagocytosed lipid, corneal collagen, and ground substance. Tear fluid contains higher levels of lysosomal enzymes.
Descemet’s membrane is usually intact and may be thickened or thinned. However, reports also describe presence of healed ruptures of Descemet’s membrane. The endothelium is intact and is either normal or attenuated.
Differential diagnosis:

Mooren’s Ulcer:

-Active Mooren’s ulcer: Active Mooren’s ulcer is usually associated with pain and conjunctival inflammation, whereas Terrien’s marginal degeneration is usually painless and uninflamed. Mooren’s ulcer may have inflammatory infiltrate and an overhanging central edge, usually with an epithelial defect. There is no lipid deposition. Ulceration involves anterior one- third of the cornea and usually spreads rapidly, both circumferentially and centrally with infiltration and vascularisation at the leading edge. An autoimmune trigger or a history of insult or trauma to the cornea may be the causative factor for Mooren’s ulcer. Terrien’s marginal degeneration shows a gradually sloping central edge with intact epithelium and it shows lipid deposition. Terrien’s, probably a degenerative process, progresses slowly and circumferentially. Peripheral cornea may be vascularised in both conditions.
- Healed Mooren’s ulcer: Healed Mooren’s ulcer is a common disease mimicking Terrien’s marginal degeneration. Both diseases lack systemic findings. Mooren’s ulcer may be bilateral or unilateral, whereas Terrien’s is usually bilateral.

Pellucid marginal degeneration: Peripheral corneal thinning associated with pellucid marginal degeneration is inferior and lacks lipid deposition and vascularisation. It is usually bilateral but may be asymmetric. Onset occurs during fourth and fifth decades of life. There is a slowly progressive 1- 2mm band of inferior thinning leaving 1- 2mm margin from the limbus. It presents with an area of steepening superior to the area of corneal thinning.
Keratoconus: Keratoconus is a progressive stromal thinning occurring centrally or paracentrally. It is bilateral, but may be asymmetric, and begins around puberty. Retinoscopy shows scissoring reflex. Slit lamp (bio- microscopy) may reveal Vogt striae (vertical stress lines in deep stroma) or epithelial Fleischer ring (iron deposit at the base of the cone). Keratoconus patients have progressive myopia, irregular astigmatism with steep keratometry readings. Munson’s sign, which is bulging of lower lid on down- gaze, may also be present. Rizutti’s sign is an arrowhead pattern at the nasal limbus being produced by focusing of a light beam shown from temporal side across the cornea in keratoconus. Severe cases may develop acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous humour through breaks in Descemet’s membrane).
Furrow or gutter degeneration: Furrow or gutter degeneration lacks vascularisation.
Collagen vascular diseases: Corneal thinning in collagen vascular diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener’s granulomatosis and polyarteritis nodosa is usually associated with systemic findings.
Arcus senilis: Arcus senilis may mimic peripheral opacification associated with early stages of Terrien’s marginal degeneration. Arcus senilis is characterised by both superior and inferior peripheral corneal opacification, absence of vascularisation, and lack of corneal thinning. It progresses circumferentially to form a band about 1mm wide in perilimbal cornea. The peripheral edge is sharp and separated from the limbus by a clear zone.
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis: Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a recurrent bilateral condition presenting with itching, photophobia, foreign body sensation and mucous discharge. It affects palpebral conjunctiva, limbal area of the cornea or both. It produces giant papillae in superior palpebral conjunctiva and/or limbal papillae with a white apex called Horner-Trantas dots. Corneal changes such as punctate epithelial erosions, macro-erosions and shield ulcers may also occur.
Ocular rosacea: Rosacea is an idiopathic skin condition affecting sun- exposed areas. Clinical features include facial flushing, papulopustular rash and thickening of skin that may evolve into rhinophyma (swollen enlarged nose). Ocular symptoms include irritation, watering and burning. The lids may show superficial telangiectasias and blepharitis. There may be conjunctival hyperaemia. Cornea may develop punctate epithelial erosions, marginal keratitis, corneal vascularisation or scarring.
Staphylococcal marginal keratitis: Staphylococcal marginal keratitis lesions usually have a lucid interval (separated from the limbus by a clear zone) between the limbus and the infiltrate and only rarely cause thinning.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Usually no treatment is required, unless perforation or impending perforation occurs. However, spectacles and rigid gas permeable lenses are prescribed for refractive errors.
Medical therapy:

Spectacle correction: To begin with in the early mild cases of the disease, spectacle correction is prescribed. Patients with high astigmatism may be prescribed with high refractive index sphero-cylindrical glasses. Due to the risk of corneal perforation in the area of TMD, polycarbonate lenses are recommended. Polycarbonate lenses are light weight and impact resistant.
Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses may be required for cases of TMD. Piggyback rigid gas permeable contact lenses may be used. In piggyback, a soft contact lens is worn under the gas permeable lens, acting as a cushion to reduce or eliminate any discomfort caused by the gas- permeable lens. It is recommended that patients wear plano polycarbonate glasses over their contact lens prescription to avoid any risk of corneal perforation due to thinning.


Surgical therapy: 

Keratoplasty: Keratoplasty is considered for patients with TMD whose vision is inadequate with contact lenses or for patients who are intolerant to lens. Reconstructive keratoplasty is performed when thinning becomes so severe that corneal perforation is threatened or it occurs.

Penetrating keratoplasty: In general, patients with TMD are usually poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty as the corneal thinning occurs close to the limbus. As a result, large eccentric grafts are required and must be positioned very close to the limbus thus increasing the chances of graft rejection or suture-induced complications.
Lamellar crescentic keratoplasty: In lamellar crescentic keratoplasty, crescent-shaped donor lamellar (partial thickness) cornea is used.
Full- thickness crescentic keratoplasty: In Full- thickness crescentic keratoplasty, thinned cornea is removed entirely and the Descemet’s membrane of the donor is retained.
Annular lamellar keratoplasty: Annular lamellar keratoplasty grafts may be required in severe cases of Terrien’s marginal degeneration, involving complete 360˚.
Lamellar keratoplasties are often preferred over penetrating keratoplasty because of the decreased risk of graft rejection, corneal opacification and development of irregular astigmatism.

Prognosis:
Most patients with no impending perforation may be managed successfully with glasses or rigid gas- permeable contact lenses. Because there is typically no epithelial defect, the risk of infectious keratitis and acute corneal thinning is low. However, these patients require regular monitoring."
Taeniasis/cysticercosis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/taeniasis-cysticercosis,"Taeniasis is an intestinal infection caused by adult tapeworms. Humans can get infected with two species of tapeworms-Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm). T.saginata has no major impact on human health while T. solium leads to neurocysticercosis-most severe form of the disease.
Neurocysticercosis is a common cause of seizures; and the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) 30% of all epilepsy cases in endemic countries and 3% epileptic cases globally may be due to neurocysticercosis.
Taeniasis/cysticercosis mainly affects the people in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Taeniasis and (neuro)cysticercosis are common in areas where animal husbandry practices are such that pigs and cattle come into contact with human faeces. But imported taeniasis can also lead to cases in the population of countries whereT.solium is not considered a public health problem. 
The disease is prevalent in all states of India, although the prevalence varies between the states. The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore reported neurocysticercosis (NCC) in 2% of unselected series of epilepsy patients. In a study from New Delhi, NCC accounted for 2.5% of all intracranial space occupying lesions. An unusual feature of the disease was seen that more than 95% of Indian patients with NCC are vegetarians.
Cysticercosis is highly prevalent in the northern States of Bihar, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. In a rural pig farming community of Mohanlalganj block, Lucknow district, Uttar Pradesh, the prevalence of taeniasis was found to be 18.6%.In the same community, active epilepsy was confirmed in 5.8% of the populations and 48.3% of people with epilepsy fulfilled either definitive or probable diagnostic criteria for NCC.
Humans become infected after consuming raw or undercooked, infected meat, or food and water contaminated with tapeworm eggs, or through poor hygiene practices. When T.solium larvae invade body tissues, a more serious condition known as cysticercosis develops. When larvae invade the central nervous system, muscles, skin and eyes, it leads to neurocysticercosis.
Neurocysticercosis is an important and preventable cause of epilepsy which creates burden through stigmatization, incapacitation and loss of work productivity. In Southeast Asia T. solium taeniasis/cystcercosis is considered one of the major neglected tropical diseases by WHO as these have not been given enough importance at national or international levels.","A tapeworm infection does not always cause symptoms. Sometimes symptoms are mild and non-specific such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea or constipation. Symptoms may arise 6–8 weeks after ingestion of meat containing cysticerci; when the tapeworms become fully developed in the intestine. These symptoms may continue until the tapeworm dies following treatment, otherwise it may live for years.
In the case of cysticercosis due toT.solium, the incubation period is variable, and infected people may remain asymptomatic for years. In some endemic regions (particularly in Asia), infected people may develop visible or palpable nodules (a small solid bump or node that can be detected by touch) beneath the skin (subcutaneous).
Neurocysticercosis is associated with different signs and symptoms depending on the number, size, stage, and location of the pathological changes as well as the host’s immune response and the parasite’s genotype. Symptoms may include chronic headaches, blindness, seizures, and dementia. Signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus, meningitis, and space occupying lesions in the central nervous system may be present. In severe cases, neurocysticercosis may be fatal.
Clinically asymptomatic cases can also be found.","Taeniasis is intestinal infection caused by two species of tapeworms Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm).
Taeniasis is acquired by humans through the ingestion of undercooked pork or beef, infected with cysticerci or contaminated food (mainly vegetables) and water. In the human body, cysticerci develop into adult tapeworms that live in the intestine and release egg-bearing gravid proglottids (segments) which are passed with faeces.
When proglottids or eggs are ingested by pigs and cattle with egg-contaminated vegetation, the eggs hatch and burrow through their intestinal wall. The larvae burrow into muscles and form fluid-filled cysts, called cysticercosis.
In the case ofT. solium, when the central nervous system is affected, the infection is called neurocysticercosis.
Taeniasis and (neuro) cysticercosis are common in areas where animal husbandry practices are such that pigs and cattle come into contact with human faeces.","(a) Examination of stool samples-Diagnosis ofTaenia tapeworm infections can be made by examination of stool samples; Stool specimens should be collected on three different days and examined in the lab fortaenia eggs using a microscope. Tapeworm eggs can be detected in the stool 2 to 3 months after the tapeworm infection is established.
(b) Serological diagnosis- complement fixation tests (CFT) and indirect haemagglutination tests (IHA)] may be used for the diagnosis of cysticercosis. Enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) and Coproantigen enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) test are also used for diagnosis.
(c)Neuroimaging diagnosis- Imaging methods play very important roles in the diagnosis of human cysticercosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the best neuro-imaging tool for the detection of degenerating and innocuous (viable) cysticerci.
Computed tomography (CT) is the best for calcified lesions.","Treatment of taeniasis may include administration of praziquantel (single-administration) or niclosamide (single-administration) and if the patient has cysticercosis in addition to taeniasis, praziquantel should be used with caution. Praziquantel is cysticidal and can cause inflammation around dying cysts in those with cysticercosis, which may lead to seizures or other symptoms.
After treatment, stools should be collected for 3 days to search for tapeworm proglottids for species identification. Stools should be re-examined forTaeniaeggs one and three months after treatment to be sure the infection is cleared.
The treatment of human cysticercosis may include long courses with praziquantel and/or albendazole, as well as supporting therapy with corticosteroids and/or anti-epileptic drugs.
Ocular, ventricular, and spinal lesions may require surgical treatment because treatment with anthelmintic drugs can provoke irreversible drug-induced inflammation."
Typhoid / Enteric Fever,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/other-gastro-intestinal/typhoid-enteric-fever,"Enteric fever, also known as typhoid, is a common worldwide bacterial disease caused by the ingestion of contaminated food or water which contain the bacterium Salmonella enterica enterica, serovarTyphi. It is very common in India. Symptoms usually develop one to two weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. Symptoms include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-colored spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics.
However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread. Healthy carriers should be excluded from handling food.","The symptoms of typhoid fever usually develop one to two weeks after a person becomes infected with the Salmonella typhi bacteria. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks, and the duration of the illness is about four to six weeks.
In first week:

Spiky high grade fever (103-104 F)
Vomiting – this usually affects children rather than adults
A dry cough
A dull headache that can be felt at the front of the head
Severe mental confusion, such as not knowing where you are or what is going on around you
A skin rash made up of pink spots that are 1–4cm wide – there are usually fewer than five spots known as ""Rose spots""
A feeling of being increasingly very unwell

In second weekSymptoms becomes more severe:

Swollen abdomen
A slow heartbeat (Bradycardia)

In third week

Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Physical exhaustion
Bouts of foul-smelling, yellow–green, watery diarrhoea
Severe swelling of the abdomen
Rapid breathing
A deterioration of mental state, such as severe confusion, apathy and, in some cases, psychosis (where a person is unable to tell the difference between reality and their imagination)","The bacteria that cause typhoid fever is S. typhi.
It spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If person eats or drinks something which is contaminated, the bacteria may enter body. Then it travel into the intestines, and then into bloodstream, where it can get into lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of body.","Your doctor may look for symptoms and medical histroy, if he suspects typhoid. but diagnosis is generally confirmed by blood culture.
Blood culture:
A complete blood count (CBC)will show a high number of white blood cells. A blood culture during the first week of the fever can show S. typhi bacteria. Body fluid or tissue culture For the culture, a small sample of blood, stool, urine or bone marrow is placed on a special medium that encourages the growth of bacteria.
In 48 to 72 hours, the culture is analysed under a microscope for the presence of bacteria. A bone marrow culture is often regarded as a more sensitive test for S. typhi. Although performing a culture test is the essential for diagnosis, in some instances other testing may be used to confirm a suspected typhoid infection, such as a test to detect antibodies to typhoid bacteria in blood or a test that checks for typhoid DNA in blood.
Other tests include:

ELISA (Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) urine test to look for the bacteria that cause Typhoid fever
Fluorescent antibody to look for antibodies that are specific to Typhoid bacteria
Platelet count (platelet count will be low)

This is an indicative treatment. One should consult a physician before reaching to any conclusion.","Medications: A fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. A third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone orcefotaxime is the first choice. Cefixime is a suitable oral alternative. Antibiotics, such as ampicillin,chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin, have been commonly used to treat enteric fever.
This is an indicative information for better understanding of health. For any treatment purpose you should consult your physician."
Traumatic Hyphaema,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/traumatic-hyphaema,"Traumatic Hyphaema is the accumulation of blood in the anterior chamber of eye following trauma. Trauma is the most common cause of hyphaema. Traumatic hyphaema may occur following both blunt and penetrating injuries. A ruptured iris root blood vessel generally causes bleeding. Hyphaema may affect vision by blocking the visual axis. Hyphaema may also be a sign of associated damage to intraocular tissues. Damage to intraocular tissues may be the cause of poor vision in spite of resolution of hyphaema.
Following conditions may produce spontaneous hyphaema

Rubeosis iridis
Retinoblastoma
Juvenile xanthogranuloma
Haemophilia
Leukaemia
Anticoagulant therapy


Traumatic hyphaema predominantly affect males in the age group below twenty years. Lack of protective eyewear in sports is a predisposing factor. Use of polycarbonate safety lenses may decrease the incidence of traumatic hyphaema.
Though traumatic hyphaema often resolves without any sequelae, the potential for visual loss should not be underestimated.","Symptoms may be

Pain in the eye.
Diminution of vision
Photophobia
Drowsiness, especially in children","Blunt trauma is the most common cause of hyphaema. Compressive force to the eye may damage iris, ciliary body, trabecular meshwork and their associated blood vessels. Shearing forces due to injury may tear away the blood vessels.
Iatrogenic hyphaema may occur during intra-operative procedures or may develop post-operatively. Hyphaema may also develop following ocular laser procedure.
Spontaneous hyphaema may be secondary to neo-vascularisation, ocular neoplasms, uveitis or vascular anomalies.","Clinical history and examination may help in identification of most hyphaemas. Upright posture of patient at an angle of 30° allows the hyphaema to settle at a fluid level. Size and shape of hyphaema is recorded daily, so as to assess its resolution or secondary haemorrhage, if it occurs. Daily assessment of visual acuity and pupillary reactions help in assessment of progress of medical management. Applanation tonometry to record intraocular pressure is deferred, unless elevated intraocular pressure is suspected. Fundus examination is also postponed till the media is clear, barring few exceptions. B- Scan can be done, if retinal detachment is suspected.
Based on the amount of blood present in the anterior chamber at the time of presentation, Hyphaema is classified into grades.
The grades are:

Microscopic: Circulation of red blood cells only, no layering.
Grade I: Less than 33% of anterior chamber is filled with blood.
Grade II: 33%- 50% of anterior chamber is filled with blood.
Grade III: 50%- 95% of anterior chamber is filled with blood.
Grade IV: 100% of anterior chamber is filled with blood (Total or ‘Eight ball’ hyphaema).


Total hyphaema is differentiated from eight- ball hyphaema by retention of bright red colour, which indicates aqueous circulation. In ‘Eight- ball’ hyphaema, blood clots and take on black or purple colour because of impaired aqueous circulation and deoxygenation, which prevents resorption.

Differential diagnosis
Traumatic hyphaema should be differentiated from hyphaema due to causes such as

Neovascularisation
Neoplasm
Ocular surgery
Treatment with lasers
Infections/ Inflammatory conditions
Vascular anomalies","There is diversity of opinion regarding how to manage patients with traumatic hyphaema. Proper information of the current status and serious nature of injury to eye is the first step of management.

Supportive therapy:
Elevation of head of patient helps in settling of the hyphaema due to gravity. This may help in clearing the visual axis to improve the vision and allow fundus examination. Eye patching with metal shield protects the eye.
Inpatient care of patient has been the standard care for many years. It helps in easy monitoring and administration of medicines.
Some recent studies have shown comparable outcomes with outpatient daily visits. Outpatient visit is preferred by patient and their family and is recommended in compliant patients.
Inpatient management is still advisable for patients who are at increased risk of secondary bleeding, glaucoma or possible noncompliance.

Medical therapy:

Anti-glaucoma drugs: Elevated intraocular pressure is common after injury to eye and may lead to corneal blood staining. Drugs like topical beta-adrenergic antagonists are usually the first choice. Hyperosmotic agents and topical/systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used. Patients with sickle cell anaemia require intensive treatment because sickle cells can block the angle of anterior chamber. This may lead to elevation of intraocular pressure.
Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids may reduce the risk of secondary haemorrhage by inhibiting fibrinolysis and stabilising blood-ocular barrier. Topical corticosteroids have shown to reduce intraocular inflammation and may prevent re-bleeding. It reduces iritis and prevent formation of posterior synechia in adults.
Antifibrinolytics: To reduce re-bleeding, topical and systemic antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid may be used. These inhibit fibrinolysis and stabilise blood clot.

Topical cycloplegic agents are useful in patients with significant ciliary spasm or photophobia.

Surgical therapy:
Medical therapy is preferable for initial four days if rise in intraocular pressure is well controlled and there is no blood staining of cornea. Surgical evacuation of blood may be required in certain group of cases.
Indications for surgical evacuation of blood clot in hyphaema:
Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), unresponsive to medical therapy:

IOP &gt; 50 mm of Hg for 5 days.
IOP &gt; 35 mm of Hg for 7 days.
IOP &gt; 25 mm of Hg for 1 day in patients with sickle cell disease or trait or pre-existing glaucoma.

Corneal blood staining:

At the first sign of blood staining, regardless of IOP or grade of hyphaema.
IOP &gt; 25 and total hyphaema to prevent blood staining.

Prolonged duration of clot:

Persistent total hyphaema &gt; 5 days.
Persistent small hyphaema &gt; 10 days.


Prognosis:
Prognosis for recovery of vision is related to damage to other ocular structures, development of glaucoma, corneal blood staining, re-bleeding and optic atrophy. Patients with traumatic hyphaema requires follow up for assessment of development of any complications."
Trochlear Nerve Palsy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/trochlear-nerve-palsy,"Trochlear Nerve Palsy (Fourth Cranial Nerve Palsy) manifests as an isolated vertical, diagonal, or cyclo-torsional diplopia (double vision). It is worse on looking down and to the side opposite the lesion. In addition to the defect in eye movement, the affected eye produces characteristic head tilt away from the affected side. Fourth cranial nerve palsies are relatively uncommon. Isolated fourth cranial nerve palsy is the most common cause producing vertical diplopia. Trauma is the usual trigger of trochlear nerve palsy. In adults, isolated fourth cranial nerve palsy may occur due to infarction of peripheral trochlear nerve or because of monocular visual deprivation due to decompensation of asymptomatic congenital nerve palsy.
Trochlear nerve supplies superior oblique muscles of both eyes, and it produces depression, incycloduction, and abduction. The extraocular muscles rotate eyeball around vertical, antero-posterior, and horizontal axis.
Trochlear nerve may be affected in its intracranial course in diseases such as

Posterior fossa tumours
Tumours in the region of sella turcica
Giant aneurysm of internal carotid artery in its intra-cavernous part

Closed head injury is the most common cause of acquired trochlear nerve palsy.
Involvement of trochlear nerve is less common than third and sixth cranial nerves in intracranial mass lesions.
Bilateral trochlear nerve palsy causes inability to depress either eye fully in adduction.","Patients with isolated trochlear nerve palsy may be asymptomatic.
Symptoms include

Slight elevation of the eye with the paralysed muscle in the primary position of gaze
Vertical and torsional (intorsion) diplopia, which is worse in inferior gaze
Head tilt on the opposite shoulder (to minimise diplopia)
Inability to depress either eye fully in adduction (in bilateral trochlear nerve palsies)","The Causes of trochlear nerve palsy may be

Congenital
Closed head trauma
Intracranial space occupying lesions
Aneurysm of internal carotid artery in its intra-cavernous course
Decompensation of asymptomatic congenital palsy because of monocular visual deprivation
Idiopathic
Presumed microvascular (diabetes mellitus or hypertension). There is no direct evidence of ischaemia.

Virtually all microvascular cases resolve even without treatment.","Diagnosis depends upon the clinical features and the clinical tests.
Trochlear nerve palsy typically produces diplopia, which is worse in downgaze. Because of diplopia in downgaze, patients tend to close one eye while reading.
Some cases reveal limited downgaze in adducted position. However, ocular movements are grossly normal in most of the cases.
Ipsilateral head tilting increases vertical strabismus, and thus, diplopia. Therefore, patients tilt their head on the opposite side to avoid diplopia.

Tests:

Cover-uncover test: Cover-uncover test demonstrate hypertropia which worsens in contralateral gaze.
Maddox rod test: Like Cover-uncover test, Maddox rod test also demonstrate hypertropia, which worsens in contralateral gaze.
Parks-Bielschowsky 3-step test: Parks-Bielschowsky 3-step test identify patterns of ocular motility conforming to dysfunction of specific vertically acting extraocular muscle of the eye. The three steps are:

Step 1: Find the side of hypertropia in the primary gaze. For example, if the right eye is higher, the weakness lies either in the muscles depressing right eye (right superior oblique muscle and right inferior rectus muscle) or in the elevators of left eye (left superior rectus muscle and left inferior oblique muscle).
Step 2: Determine which gaze, left or right, the hypertropia is more. If the right eye deviates most when the head is turned to the right (both eyes turn to the left), then only right superior oblique muscle or left superior rectus muscle is affected.
Step 3: Determine which side the head tilt, left or right, the hypertropia is more. This test relies on the torsional balancing reflexes provoked by head tilt. The higher eye extorts (because of inferior oblique muscle), while the lower eye intorts (because of superior oblique muscle).
Since superior oblique muscle is by far most commonly responsible for vertical diplopia, a head tilt to the same side as the involved muscle exacerbates it. The eye that is highest in adduction looks at the affected muscle.

Bilateral trochlear nerve palsy should be considered as well, whenever unilateral palsy is diagnosed, especially following head injury.
Bilateral trochlear nerve palsy presents with

Crossed hypertropia. Right eye is higher in left gaze and the left eye is higher in right gaze
Excyclotorsion of 10° or more. Each eye is rotated outwards
There is large V pattern of strabismus


In addition, a fourth step, is also useful. The fourth step determines whether the vertical separation is greater in downgaze or upgaze, and also check for relative cyclotropia.

Imaging:

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI may identify lesions affecting brain parenchyma or brainstem. It may identify lesions like brain tumour or ischaemia.
CT scanning: CT scanning may detect presence of any calcification or aneurysm.


Differential diagnosis
Trochlear nerve palsy may be differentiated from conditions like

Myasthenia gravis
Thyroid eye disease
Brown syndrome: It is characterised by restriction of superior oblique trochlea-tendon complex, so that affected eye does not elevate in adduction","Medical therapy:

Prisms: Prisms may be tried in patients with small deviation and in diplopia without any torsional component.
Botulinum toxin: Results of Botulinum toxin as a primary therapy are discouraging. However, it may be used to correct residual deviation after strabismus surgery to delay or avoid further surgery.


Surgical therapy:
Knapp classified superior oblique palsy cases by noting field of gaze in which deviation was greatest. Based on this, he recommended surgery on muscles that acted in the direction of gaze.
For cases with inferior oblique over-action, it may be weakened by tenotomy, recession, or disinsertion.
In cases with ipsilateral superior rectus restriction, a superior rectus recession is done.
Superior oblique tendon tuck is done, if there is significant laxity of the tendon, as is described in congenital cases.
Cases with no superior rectus restriction or superior oblique tendon laxity, with greatest deviation in downgaze, may undergo contralateral inferior rectus recession.
Patients with bilateral superior oblique palsy, especially with large ex-cyclotorsion, may undergo surgery for both superior oblique muscles.

Prognosis
Prognosis of Trochlear Nerve palsy depends upon the underlying aetiology.
Congenital nerve palsies often remain static for long. Idiopathic, traumatic or ischaemic palsies usually resolve with time."
Tooth Sensitivity,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/tooth-sensitivity,"Dentinal Hypersensitivity is commonly known as tooth sensitivity. If a person feels mild to severe discomfort or pain on consuming hot, cold, or sweet food and drinks or breathing in cold air, it indicates sensitive teeth. It is a very common clinical presentation and causes considerable concern for patients. Studies showed that in most populations, 10-30% of the general population suffer from dentinal hypersensitivity.
DEFINITION
Dentine hypersensitivity (DH) is defined as short, sharp pain arising from exposed dentine, typically in response to chemical, thermal or osmotic stimuli that cannot be explained as arising from any other forms of dental defect or pathology. 
-(Addy &amp; Dowell, 1983)
It is common in people of age 20 - 40 years, with the peak incidence occurring at the end of the third decade and decreases during the fourth and fifth decades of life. Women are affected more than men.

https://www.dentalhealth.org/sensitive-teeth",No Symptoms.,"The tooth has outer enamel layer that protects the dentin underneath. The dentin comprises of microscopic tubules or canals that are connected to the pulp of the tooth. If dentin loses its protective covering of enamel its tubules get exposed. These tubules allow heat, cold or acidic foods to reach the nerves and cells inside the pulp of the tooth and the tooth becomes sensitive.

Toothbrush abrasion: Brushing too hard, and brushing from side to side, causes enamel wear, making freshly exposed dentine sensitive.

Dental erosion:It is loss of tooth enamel due to attacks of acid from acidic food and drinks. If enamel is worn away, the dentine underneath is exposed which may lead to sensitivity.

Gum disease: A build-up of plaque or tartar can cause the gum to recede down the tooth and even destroy the bony support of the tooth. Due to receded gums, roots of the teeth get exposed and become more sensitive. Pockets can form in the gums around the tooth, making the area difficult to keep clean and the problem worsen.

Tooth grinding: A habit which involves clenching and grinding of the teeth. This also causes the teeth enamel to be worn away, making the teeth sensitive.

Acracked toothor filling: a cracked tooth/filling is the one that has broken.

Tooth bleaching: some patients have sensitivity for a short time during bleaching or after bleaching

Several theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism involved in dentinal hypersensitivity such as the transducer theory, the modulation theory, the “gate” control and vibration theory, and the hydrodynamic theory.
The most widely accepted theory is Brannstrom’s hydrodynamic theory, that is fluid movement within the dentinal tubules.

Ulcerative Colitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/oral/ulcerative-colitis,"It is a form ofinflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis is a form of colitis, a disease of the colon (large intestine) that includes characteristic ulcers or open sores. Ulcerative colitis is similar to Crohn's disease, another form of IBD. Ulcerative colitis is an intermittent disease, with periods of exacerbated symptoms, and periods that are relatively symptom free. Ulcerative colitis is treated as an autoimmune disease.","These can vary depending on how much of the colon is affected and the level of inflammation. Common symptoms include

Abdominal pain
Bloodydiarrheawith mucus
Tiredness and fatigue
Loss of appetite and weight loss
Anemia(shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, tiredness and pale skin)
A high temperature (fever) of or above 38C (100.4F)
Dehydration

A constant desire to empty the bowels (known as tenesmus)","The exact cause of the disease is unknown. But it is associated with autoimmune disorder which is a combination of genetic and environmental factors:
Genetic factorsare associated with developing ulcerative colitis, although exactly how they do this is still uncertain.
Environmental factors:

Air pollution
Diet: Rich in carbohydrates and fats.
Hygiene: Immune system requires exposure to germs to develop properly.","To diagnose ulcerative colitis various tests are performed:
Sigmoidoscopy:The diagnosis will need to be confirmed by examining the level and extent of the inflammation of the bowel. This is initially done by using a sigmoidoscope, which is a flexible tube containing a camera that is inserted into the rectum
Colonoscopy:A colonoscopy uses a longer and more flexible tube called the colonscope, which allows entire colon to be examined","Aminosalicylates:Aminosalicylates are the first treatment option for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.
Corticosteroids:Corticosteroids (steroid medication) may be used if ulcerative colitis is more severe or not responding to aminosalicylates."
Urticaria,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/urticaria,"Hives are red and sometimes itchy bumps on the skin. It is generally caused due to an allergic reaction to a drug or food. Allergic reactions cause body to release chemicals that can make skin swell up in hives. People who have other allergies are more likely to get hives than other people. Other causes include infections and stress.
Classification:
• Acute urticaria is defined as the presence of wheals which completely resolve within six weeks. Acute urticaria becomes evident a few minutes after the person has been exposed to an allergen. The outbreak may last several weeks, but usually the hives are gone in six weeks.
• Chronic urticaria (ordinary urticaria) is defined as the presence of wheels which persist for greater than six weeks. Some of the more severe chronic cases have lasted more than 20 years","Appear as small round wheals, rings or patches and may change shape
Itching may be accompanied by a red flare
Often appear on the face or the extremities
Sometimes it lasts from 30 minutes to 36 hours. As some patches disappear, new patches may develop","Urticaria is caused by the release of histamine and other chemicals from under the skin's surface, causing the tissues to swell.
Some risks factors:

An allergic reaction to food, such as peanuts, shellfish, eggs and cheese
An allergic reaction to environmental factors such as pollen, dust mites or chemicals
An allergic reaction to latex, which can be a common problem in healthcare workers
Infections, which can range from relatively trivial such as a cold to very serious such as HIV
Insect bites and stings
Emotional stress
Some medications, which can cause urticaria as a side effect, including antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and antihistamines
Physical triggers, such as pressure to the skin, change in temperature, sunlight, exercise or water.",Urticaria is generally diagnosed by looking at the rashes on the skin. Doctor may ask about the allergens and any medications.,"It generally involves symptomatic relief. Various medications included are
Antihistamines: Medicines like Cetirizine, Fexofenadine and Loratadine
Corticosteroid tablets:Medicines like prednisolone"
Varicose Veins,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/varicose-veins,"Varicose veins are swollen and enlarged veins, usually blue or dark purple in color. They may also be lumpy, bulging or twisted in appearance. They mostly occur in the legs. The blood is prevented from flowing backwards by a series of tiny valves that open and close to let blood through. If the valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and can collect in the vein, eventually causing it to be swollen and enlarged (varicose).This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more.
Varicose veins are most common in the superficial veins of the legs, which are subject to high pressure when standing. Besides being a cosmetic problem, varicose veins can be painful, especially when standing. Severe long-standing varicose veins can lead to leg swelling, venous eczema, skin thickening and ulceration. Life-threatening complications are uncommon, but Varicose veins may be confused for deep vein thrombosis, that may be life-threatening.","Varicose veins are dark purple or blue in color and are usually twisted and bulging in appearance. Some people with varicose veins may experience pain or discomfort. Symptoms of varicose veins can include:

Aching, heavy and uncomfortable legs
Appearance of spider veins (telangiectasia) in the affected leg.
Swollen feet and ankles
Burning or throbbing in legs
Muscles cramps in legs, particularly at night
Dry, itchy and thin skin over the affected vein","Varicose veins are usually caused by weak vein walls and valves. Other risks factors involved are:

Gender: Females are more likely to have varicose veins than males.
Genetics: It often runs in families
Age: Older person gets more chances of varicose veins.
Overweight: Overweight or obese people have a significantly higher risk of developing varicose veins
Pregnant: Women are much more likely to develop varicose veins during their pregnancy than at any other time in their lives","Varicose veins can rarely cause a serious condition and generally do not require treatment. Varicose veins is diagnosed by their appearance. Doctor may examine legs while patient is standing to check for signs of swelling.
Further investigations:
Doppler test: A Doppler test uses an ultrasound scan to provide information about the direction of blood flow in veins. It provides an indication of how well the valves in veins work.
Color duplex ultrasound scan: A color duplex ultrasound scan provides color images of veins structure. This allows the specialist to look for any abnormalities in the veins and measure the speed of blood flow.","Varicose veins do not always need treatment. If varicose veins are not causing any discomfort, then person may not need to have treatment. If treatment is required:
Conservative:The symptoms of varicose veins can be controlled to an extent with the following:

Elevating the legs which often provides temporary symptomatic relief.
Regular exercise
The wearing of graduated compression stockings with variable pressure gradients (Class II or III) has been shown to reduce the swelling, nutritional exchange, and improve the micro circulation in legs affected by varicose veins

Surgery:
Ligation and stripping:Most surgeons use a technique called ligation and stripping, which involves tying off the vein in the affected leg and then removing it.
Sclerotherapy:Sclerotherapy is usually suitable for people who have small to medium-sized varicose veins. The treatment involves injecting a chemical into veins. The chemical scars the veins, which seals them closed."
Vitamin B12 Deficiency,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/blood-lymphatic/vitamin-b12-deficiency,"Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is a low red blood cell count due to a lack of vitamin B12. Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.
Vitamin B 12 and folate
Vitamin B12 and folate together help the body produce red blood cells. They also have several other important functions:
Vitamin B12 keeps the nervous system (brain, nerves and spinal cord) healthy. Vitamin B12 is generally found in:

Meat
Eggs
Dairy products

Folate is important for pregnant women because it reduces the risk of birth defects in unborn babies. The best source of folate is green vegetables such as:

Broccoli
Brussel sprouts
Peas","Symptoms of anemia vary depending on the underline cause:
Vitamin B12 deficiency/ pernicious anemia
If anemia is caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, one may have symptoms like:

Yellow coloration of skin
A sore and red tongue (glossitis)
Ulcers inside mouth
An altered sense of touch
Disturbed vision
Irritability
Depression
Psychosis
Dementia – a decline in mental abilities, such as memory, understanding and judgment

Folate deficiency
As well as general symptoms of anemia, a folate deficiency may also cause:

Loss of sensation, such as a reduced sense of touch or pain
Muscle weakness
Depression","The exact cause is not known, but disease is associated with certain risks factors which include:

Age – Pernicious anemia is most common at later age
Gender – Pernicious anemia affects slightly more women than men
Family history – nearly a third of people with anemia also have a family member with the condition
Autoimmune condition, such as Addison’s disease or vitiligo – is also associated with anemia and other autoimmune conditions
Diet- The body generally stores vitamin B12 to last approximately two to four years. However, it is important to have vitamin B12 in the diet to ensure the store is kept at a healthy level.
Conditions affecting the stomach- Some stomach conditions or stomach operations can also prevent the absorption of vitamin B12. For example, a gastrectomy(a surgical procedure where part of stomach is removed) also increases risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency anemia.
Conditions affecting the intestines- Some conditions that affect intestines (part of the digestive system). For example, Crohn’s disease (a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes result in body not able to absorb enough vitamin B12.

Folate deficiency anaemia
Folate is a water-soluble vitamin (it dissolves in water), as a result body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Body stores folate that last four months. This means one need folate in daily diet to ensure body has sufficient stores of the vitamin.

Diet- Not having enough folate in daily diet.
Mal absorption- Sometimes body is unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually the result of an underlying condition affecting digestive system, such as Coeliac disease.
Excessive urination- Body may lose folate from body if one urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of the organs, such as your kidneys or liver.
Pregnancy- If a women is pregnant or planning to get pregnant, daily supplement of 0.4mg of folic acid should be taken for at least 12 weeks.",Diagnosis may require a complete blood count or peripheral blood smear based on patient history and physical examination.,"Treatment mainly depends upon the underlying conditions for the anemia:
Diet related
If vitamin B12 deficiency is caused by a lack of the vitamin in the diet, doctor may prescribe vitamin B12 tablets to take every day between meals. Alternatively, patient may have to take an injection of hydroxocobalamin twice a year.
Good sources of vitamin B12 include: 

Meat
Salmon
Milk
Eggs

If a person is vegetarian, alternative food for meat and dairy products, that contains vitamin B12, such as:

Some fortified breakfast cereals
Some soy products

Not diet related
If vitamin B12 deficiency is not caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in diet, patient may need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin every three months for the rest of life.
Folate deficiency anaemia
To treat folate deficiency anaemia, doctor may prescribe daily folic acid tablets to build up patient's folate levels."
Vitiligo,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/neurological/vitiligo,"It is a condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on skin (de pigmentation of the skin). Vitiligo can affect any area of the skin, but most commonly occurs on skin exposed to the sun, such as face, neck and hands. The condition varies from person to person.

It occurs when melanocytes, the cells responsible for skin pigmentation, die or are unable to function. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but research suggests that it may arise from autoimmune, genetic, oxidative stress, neural, or viral causes.","Vitiligo is flat, white spots or patches on the skin.
Lesions are hypo pigmented. Patients are stigmatized for their condition and may experience depression and similar mood disorders.","Vitiligo is caused by the lack of a skin pigment called melanin. It may be further associated with the conditions:

Autoimmune Conditions:
Non-segmental vitiligo, the most common type of vitiligo, is thought to be an autoimmune condition. This means that the immune system (the body’s natural defense system) does not work properly. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as viruses, immune system produces antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that attack the body’s own healthy cells and tissue.

Neurochemicals:
Segmental vitiligo, the less common type of vitiligo, is thought to be caused by chemicals released from the nerve endings in the skin. These chemicals are poisonous to the melanocyte skin cells.","Vitiligo can usually be diagnosed by physical examination done by a physician.
Further tests:
Wood’s lamp
If one is available, doctor may use an ultraviolet lamp called a Wood’s lamp to look at skin in more detail. For this there is a need of dark room and the lamp will be held 10-13cm (4-5in) away from skin. Under the ultraviolet light, the patches of vitiligo will be easier to see.
Other autoimmune conditions
Non-segmental vitiligo, the most common type of vitiligo, is closely associated with other autoimmune conditions.","There is no specific cure for the disease. However, skin's appearance can be stored with the help of certain treatments.
Medical treatment include:

Medicines (such as steroid creams) to be applied on skin.
A treatment that uses medicine plus ultraviolet A (UVA) light (PUVA)

Surgical treatments include:

Skin grafts from a person’s own tissues. The doctor may takes skin from one area of a patient’s body and attaches it to another area. This is sometimes used for people with small patches of vitiligo."
Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis,"Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) or spring catarrh is a chronic, recurrent, bilateral, at times asymmetrical, seasonally exacerbated external ocular inflammation affecting children and young adults. VKC usually begins before the age of 10 years. It generally resolves around puberty, usually about 4-10 years after onset and only rarely may persist beyond the age of 25 years.
It is more common in males than in females. The male preponderance is prominent below 20 years of age but thereafter, male and female ratio of involvement becomes almost equal.
The exact aetiology and pathogenesis is still unclear, although allergic nature of this disease is being accepted for long. Role of genetic predisposition and environmental factors in onset, progression and resolution of this self-limiting disease, but incapacitating at times, is not clear. Occurrence of this disease is not limited to spring, with episodes of reactivity being quite common in winter. Initial seasonal feature turn into perennial (occurring throughout the year) disease after few years.
Patients may have associated atopy (genetic tendency to develop allergic disease) or have a close family history of atopy. Atopic patients often develop asthma, eczema and seasonal allergic rhinitis during infancy.
Although this is not usually a blinding disease, visual impairment may occur if there is corneal involvement.
Patients with VKC have an increased incidence of keratoconus.
Three main clinical types are:-
- Palpebral (Eyelid).
- Limbal (junction between conjunctiva and cornea). 
- Mixed.
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis has a wide geographical distribution and young people in dry and hot climates are primarily affected.","Patients with VKC may have several episodes of active inflammation throughout the year, but symptoms are characteristically worse during spring and summer.
Patient may have following symptoms in eyes:
- Itching is the most important and most common symptom. Itching may vary from mild to intense and is exacerbated by exposure to dust, wind, bright light, hot weather or physical exertion associated with sweating.
- Conjunctival redness.
- Watering.
- Thick mucoid discharge with sticky mucous filaments, called ‘ropy discharge’, is characteristic of VKC.
- Pain and discomfort.
- Irritation.
- Foreign body sensation.
- Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva).
- Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light).
- Blepharospasm (involuntary closure of eyelid muscles).
- Blurring of vision.
- Swelling of lids.

In addition to ocular (eye) symptoms, patient may show symptoms of associated systemic allergic or atopic conditions such as eczema, asthma, rhinitis or urticaria.","The exact aetiology and pathogenesis is still not clear, although allergic nature of this disease is being accepted for long. Role of genetic predisposition and environmental factors in onset, its progression and resolution of this self-limiting disease, is not clear.
Genetics of disease:
No genetic predisposing factor has been identified, but the predominance of VKC in Asia and Africa strengthens the possibility of a genetic predisposition.
Type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction occur when a sensitised individual comes into contact with a specific antigen. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) has a strong affinity for mast cells, and the cross-linking of IgE with antigen triggers mast cell degranulation. Mast cell degranulation releases various mediators of inflammatory cascade which results in an increase in vascular permeability and migration of eosinophils and neutrophils.
Associated conditions:
Family history of allergic disorders and multiple atopic diseases may be present in some patients suffering from VKC.
Conditions which may be associated with VKC are:
- Atopy: Atopy, defined as the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, is common among VKC patients. Asthma is the most common atopic disease found among VKC patients. Other associated atopic diseases may be eczema, rhinitis or urticaria.
- Keratoconus (conical cornea) and acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous): Keratoconus and acute hydrops may be associated with VKC.
- Sex-hormone related diseases: Sex-hormone related diseases such as gynaecomastia, mammary fibro-adenoma, polycystic ovary syndrome and autoimmune diseases are also being reported with VKC.","Diagnosis of VKC is based upon typical clinical features, thus many mild or atypical cases may escape diagnosis. Lack of standardised diagnostic criteria regarding the severity of VKC renders this disease more difficult to diagnose and manage.
Despite facts suggesting immune responses in the pathogenesis of VKC, no clinical or laboratory test has evolved to support the diagnosis in atypical cases or predict the course of disease.
History of atopy in patient or the family, elevated serum level of total and specific IgE, higher number of eosinophils and mast cells, increased level of mediators and favourable response to anti-allergic therapy is observed in VKC.
Prevalence of IgE sensitisation is found to be significantly lesser in bulbar as compared to palpebral and mixed type of VKC.

Clinical features:
Signs of VKC are mostly confined to conjunctiva and cornea.
Palpebral VKC:
- Giant papillae: Classic conjunctival sign in palpebral VKC is the presence of giant papillae. The bluish-white papillae are separated by white connective tissue septa. Papillae, most commonly, occur on superior palpebral conjunctiva, and on rupture of connective tissue septa forms giant papillae. Inferior palpebral conjunctiva is unaffected. Giant papillae assume a flat-top appearance, which is described as ‘cobblestone papillae’. Active disease is characterised by redness, swelling and tightly packed papillae. As the inflammation settles, the papillae become more separated.
- Mucous discharge: A ropy mucous discharge may be present, which commonly is associated with palpebral papillae. Large numbers of eosinophils are present in discharge, indicating presence of extended periods of inflammation.
- Vascular abnormalities.
- Follicles.
- Sub-conjunctival scarring.
- Conjunctival inclusion cysts.
- Entropion.
- Mechanical ptosis (drooping of upper eyelids): Large papillae may cause mechanical ptosis.
Bulbar VKC:
Bulbar VKC commonly occurs in dark-skinned individuals.
- Papillae: Multiple, small, nodule-like papillae occur at the limbus (junction between cornea and conjunctiva), mostly at the upper part and have a thick gelatinous appearance.
- Horner-Trantas dots: Horner-Trantas dots (collections of degenerated epithelial cells and eosinophils) appear as multiple yellow-white spots at the apices of limbal papillae. Horner-Trantas dots rarely last longer than a week from their initial presentation.
- Micropannus: Micropannus is a superficial fibrovascular proliferation that extends 1-2 mm beyond normal vascular arcade. Micropannus may develop, more commonly, around upper limbus. (Roy Frederick Hampton, Fraunfelder Frederick W., Fraunfelder Frederick T., Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy. Sixth Edition. Saunders Elsevier. 2008. P.366.)
- Chronic limbitis (inflammation): Chronic limbitis, more common in black patients, is characterised by hyperaemic, oedematous and thickened conjunctiva. In severe cases, chronic limbitis may cause 360 degrees limbal cell deficiency.
- Peri-limbal conjunctival pigmentation: Patients may develop typical peri-limbal conjunctival pigmentation. Extent of pigmentation does not correlate with the severity of symptoms and signs of VKC. Pigment may persist when the disease becomes inactive.

Mixed VKC: 
Mixed VKC shows features of both palpebral and bulbar forms.
Corneal features:
While corneal vascularisation is rare (late corneal vascularisation may take place), cornea may be affected in a variety of ways, such as:
- Punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK): Punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK) may result from toxic effect of inflammatory mediators. PEK can coalesce, resulting in frank epithelial erosion or shield ulcer.
- Epithelial erosions: PEK may coalesce and form epithelial erosions.
- Shield Ulcer: Shield ulcers are oval-shaped epithelial defects and usually have their lower border in upper half of visual axis. Pathogenesis of shield ulcer is not well understood, major factor for its development may be chronic mechanical irritation from giant palpebral papillae. Healed shield ulcers may leave a sub-epithelial ring-like scar.
- Vernal pseudogerontoxon: Vernal pseudogerontoxon, with appearance of ‘Cupid’s Bow’ (outline in a previously inflamed segment of the limbus), is a degenerative lesion in peripheral cornea resembling arcus (white ring in periphery of cornea) senilis. Pseudogerontoxon is a waxing and waning grey-white lipid deposition in superficial stroma of peripheral cornea.
- Plaque formation: Plaque is usually caused by epithelial erosions in which the bare area becomes coated with fibrin and layers of desiccated mucus. Plaque resists wetting by tears and re-epithelialisation. New vessel growth may occur in plaque.
- Sub-epithelial scarring: Sub-epithelial scarring, usually in the form of a ring, is a sign of previous severe corneal involvement.
- Keratoconus: Keratoconus may be seen in chronic cases, which may be associated with chronic eye rubbing.
The skin of the eyelid and eyelid margin is relatively uninvolved. Conjunctiva of the fornices (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) usually does not show shortening and symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation is uncommon. Iritis (inflammation of iris) is not reported in VKC.
No precise diagnostic criteria, is established for VKC. Hyperaemia, itching, watering, photophobia and thick mucoid discharge are typical features of VKC. Large papillae on upper palpebral conjunctiva and corneo-scleral junction are hallmarks of VKC.

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry:
Histopathology of conjunctival tissue shows a prominent inflammatory cellular infiltration in epithelium and substantia propria and post-inflammatory tissue remodelling. Tissue remodelling is more marked in palpebral rather than bulbar conjunctiva.
Tissue inflammation:
Tissue inflammation in chronic cases shows cellular infiltration of both stroma and epithelium, particularly in specimens taken from limbus. Cellular infiltrates consist of eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, macrophages, plasma cells and B-lymphocytes, frequently organised as small lymphoid follicles without germinal center. Eosinophils are characteristic constituents of cellular infiltrates.
In palpebral conjunctiva, stromal infiltrate consists of diffuse T-lymphocyte reaction with clustering of B-lymphocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells and mast cells.
Tissue remodelling:
Overgrowth of conjunctival connective tissue, with formation of large and sessile papillae on upper palpebral conjunctiva, is one of the most notable finding. Conjunctival thickening, subepithelial fibrosis, neovascularisation and scarring are typical in chronic cases. Epithelial changes, connective tissue deposition, cellular infiltration, oedema and glandular hypertrophy contribute in tissue remodelling.
On histological examination, number of goblet cells is increased in giant papillae and epithelial in-growth. Epithelial in-growth in stroma is rich in goblet cells and may give pseudo-glandular appearance. Collagen fibers in palpebral giant papilla are thicker, increased and irregularly arranged. A proliferation of capillaries and neo-vascular formations provide vascular support to the papillae. Various growth factors are increased in VKC as compared to normal subjects.

Mediators in VKC:
Number of mediators and cytokines in chronic inflammatory VKC occur on ocular surface:
- Cytokines: Cytokines are small secreted proteins that mediate and regulate immunity and inflammation. These are not stored in body, but have to be produced in response to a stimulus.
- Chemokines: Chemokines are multi-potent cytokines which localise and enhance inflammation by inducing chemotaxis and cell activation of different inflammatory cells present at sites of inflammation.
- Histamine: Histamine is an important inflammatory mediator in allergic eye disease and is released by activated mast cells and basophils. Skin test reactivity to histamine shows a greater wheal and flare response in patients with VKC, suggesting hypersensitivity. Histamine causes pruritus (itching), hyperaemia and participates in allergic inflammation and tissue remodelling by altering behaviour of conjuctival epithelium and fibroblasts.
- Metalloproteinases (MMPs): Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular endopeptidases that selectively degrade components of extracellular matrix. Increased production and activation of MMPs is probably involved in the pathogenesis of conjunctival inflammation, remodelling and corneal changes.
- Growth factors: Several growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor are increased in VKC. These factors induce fibroblast growth and pro-collagen production.
Cells in VKC:
Mast cells, eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, and natural killer cells are seen in increased number in VKC.
- Mast cells: Mast cells play a key role in initiating inflammatory cascade. Mast cells are the constant feature of conjunctival tissue in patients of VKC. Increased number of mast cells in palpebral giant cells suggests an active role for these cells in abnormal connective tissue metabolism observed in VKC.
- Eosinophils: Eosinophils are the constant feature seen in lacrimal and conjunctival cytology. Majority of cells in tears during active phase of VKC are eosinophils. Eosinophils and mast cells are the main effector cells in ocular inflammation in VKC.
- T-lymphocytes: T-lymphocytes increase in conjunctiva of patients with VKC. T-lymphocytes play a vital role in the pathogenesis of chronic allergic inflammation.
- B-lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes are responsible for IgE.
- Natural killer cells: Increased Natural killer cells in conjunctiva suggests a potential role of these cells and innate immunity in VKC.
- Epithelial cells: Epithelial cells act as mechanical barrier and participate in regulation of allergic inflammation.
- Fibroblasts: Fibroblasts, maintains tissue structure, contribute to the induction and amplification of ocular allergic inflammation and tissue remodelling.

VKC should be differentiated from:
- Atopic keratoconjunctivitis.
- Giant papillary conjunctivitis.
- Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.
- Bacterial conjunctivitis.
- Viral conjunctivitia.
- Keratoconus.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Education of patients and their parents about the chronic, recurrent and ultimately resolving nature of disease is an important aspect of management. Compliance with medical advice is better with a well-informed patient.
Medical therapy:
General measures:
- Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli: Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli such as exposure to wind, sun and salt water which causes frequent conjunctival redness.
- Avoid allergens: Contact with common allergens like plants and flowers should be avoided.
- Sunglasses: Use of protective sunglasses is helpful and should be advised.
- Artificial tears: Artificial tears have been shown to be effective in relief of symptoms by direct removal and dilution of allergens from the ocular surface.
- Cold compresses: cold compresses provide symptomatic relief, especially from ocular pruritus.
- Frequent washing: Frequent face, hand and hair washing, especially before going to bed, may be helpful.
Drug therapy:
Most drugs used are merely palliative, and are not enough to treat and eliminate allergic ocular inflammation, so there is recurrence of disease on discontinuation of therapy.
Judicious and scrupulous use of medicines is important because drug treatment is prolonged and frequent. Some patients may need medicine throughout the year for satisfactory symptomatic relief.
Drugs to treat VKC include:
Variety of currently available drugs to treat VKC includes vasoconstrictors, anti-histamines, mast-cell stabiliser, dual-action drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunomodulators and anti-metabolites.
- Topical vasoconstrictor and non-specific anti-histamines: Topical vasoconstrictor and non-specific anti-histamine combination eye-drops are being used for long and are safe and effective, at least temporarily. Being available over the counter, these are tried by many patients during early stage of disease. These medicines relieve itching and reduce redness of eyes. There may be burning or stinging on instillation and rebound hyperaemia on discontinuation. This group contain vasoconstrictors like naphazoline or tetrahydrozoline and anti-histamines like pyrilamine and pheniramine.
- Systemic anti-histamines: Systemic oral anti-histamines may be used when allergy involves the eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy.
- Topical mast-cell stabilisers: Topical mast-cell stabilisers prevent mast-cell degranulation or antagonise the effects of primary mediator histamine, being released by mast cells. Drug modulation of mast cell activity alleviates acute symptoms of active disease and reduces development of chronic allergic inflammation. These medicines may be used at the onset of allergic season and continued throughout the season. This group contain drugs like sodium cromoglycate, lodoxamide, nedocromil and pemirolast.
- Topical selective H1 receptor blockers: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of VKC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines.
- H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (dual action drugs): New generation of drugs show dual activity of H1 receptor antagonism and mast-cell stabilising property. Drugs in this group are olopatadine, epinastine, azelastine and ketotifen. These drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines and ketotifen prevents eosinophil accumulation.
- Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diminish ocular pruritus and conjunctival redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Drugs in this group are ketorolac and diclofenac. These medicines inhibit pruritogenic prostaglandin production, and are good alternative to corticosteroids.
- Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids are one of the most effective medicines to control symptoms of VKC. These should not be prescribed as first-line treatment due to associated complications with their prolonged use viz. Steroid-induced cataract, glaucoma and susceptibility to viral and fungal infections. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.
Although corticosteroids are the most efficacious medicines, steroid-resistant forms of VKC are not unusual and may necessitate alternative treatment.
- Immunomodulators: Immunomodulators like cyclosporine, a fungal metabolite, decreases signs and symptoms of VKC. However, symptoms may recur after discontinuation of cyclosporine eye-drops. Topical corticosteroids and artificial tears have been shown to act synergistically with cyclosporine eye-drops and help in re-epithelialisation of corticosteroid-resistant shield ulcers.
- Anti-metabolites: Anti-metabolites like Mitomycin-C (MMC) is an inhibitor of fibroblast proliferation. MMC decreases mucoid discharge, conjunctival hyperaemia and limbal oedema in patients who are refractory to topical steroids and mast-cell stabilisers.
Surgical therapy:
Following surgical measures may be taken:
- Excision of giant papillae: Surgical excision of giant papillae is recommended if they cause lesions on the cornea. Excision of large papillae helps in early resolution of corneal epitheliopathy or ulcer, although papillae may regrow. Intra-operative application of MMC to upper palpebral conjunctiva immediately after papillae resection significantly reduces the chances of recurrence of papillae.
- Cryotherapy: Like excision of papillae, cryocoagulation may also helps in resolution of corneal epitheliopathy or ulcer. Cryotherapy of giant papillae leads to inflammation and may cause conjunctival scarring.
- Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser: Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser may be used to remove giant papillae. This procedure may be repeated on recurrence of papillae.
- Debridement of ulcer base: Debridement of ulcer base may promote re-epithelialisation.
- Removal of plaque: Surgical removal of plaque may also promote re-epithelialisation.
- Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK) helps in early re-epithelialisation of vernal shield ulcer refractory to medical treatment.
- Free autologous (derived from self) conjunctival graft: Free autologous conjunctival graft after resection of giant papillae facilitates re-epithelialisation of non-healing shield ulcer.
- Amniotic membrane graft: Amniotic membrane graft leads to complete re-epithelialisation of persistent corneal epithelial defects and vernal plaques, not improving by conventional medical treatment.
- Cultivated corneal epithelial cells: Cultivated corneal epithelial cells may be transplanted to treat severe ocular surface disease. There is significant improvement in vision after transplant. Corneal epithelial cell transplant is beneficial when amniotic membrane graft is not sufficient to restore ocular surface.


Prognosis:
In general, VKC is rather a benign and self-limiting disease that resolves with age or spontaneously at puberty. However, active disease is debilitating and necessitates therapy to contol signs and symptoms. In some patients, symptoms may persist beyond puberty into adulthood.
VKC may lead to significant vision affecting corneal complications such as scarring, ulceration and opacification. Lid involvement may significantly compromise contact lens tolerance.
Medications used for the disease may lead to complications such as preservative toxicity and steroid-induced glaucoma (raised intra-ocular pressure) or cataract."
Whooping Cough/Pertussis,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/whooping-cough-pertu,"Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs. It is also known as pertussis. Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After fits of many coughs, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breathes which result in a ""whooping"" sound. Pertussis most commonly affects infants and young children and can be fatal, especially in babies less than 1 year of age.","The classic symptoms of whooping cough are:
1. A paroxysmal cough
2. Inspiratory whoop
3. Vomiting after coughing
The others symptoms of whooping cough may include:

Runny or blocked nose
Sneezing
Watering eyes
Dry, irritating cough
Sore throat
Slightly raised temperature","Whooping cough is caused by a bacterium called Bordetella pertussis. The bacterium infects the lining of the airways, mainly the windpipe (trachea) and the two airways that branch off from it to the lungs (the bronchi). The symptoms of whooping cough usually take between six to twenty days to appear after infection with the bordetella pertussis bacterium. This delay is known as the incubation period.","Laboratory diagnosis: It include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on Bordet-Gengou medium
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a biochemical technology inmolecular biology to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence.
Serological methods: The bacteria can be recovered from the patient only during the first three weeks of illness, rendering culture and Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) testing useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.",No Management.
West Nile fever,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/west-nile-fever,"West Nile fever is a zoonotic disease (an animal disease affecting humans). Disease is caused by West Nile virus (WNV), which is a flavivirus related to the viruses that cause St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever. West Nile virus is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. WNV is maintained in nature by transmission between birds and mosquitoes; as birds are the natural hosts of the virus. Humans, horses and other mammals can be infected.
West Nile fever can cause severe neurological illness and death in people, however about 80% of people who are infected show no symptoms.
West Nile virus was first isolated in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. An epidemic of West Nile fever was reported in humans in Israel in 1951. In 1999 WNV was imported in New York and produced a large outbreak that spread throughout the continental United States of America (USA) during 1999-2010. Large outbreaks also occurred in Greece, Israel, Romania and Russia. The virus is now widely reported from Canada to Venezuela. Outbreak sites are on major birds’ migratory routes. WNV is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia.
WNV is highly prevalent in India. Infection usually presents as a mild, non-fatal dengue like illness in humans. Febrile illness and encephalitis cases in epidemic form were observed in Udaipur district of Rajasthan, Buldhana, Marathwada and Khandesh districts of Maharashtra. Human sera collected from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Rajasthan showed presence of WNV neutralizing antibodies. Serologically confirmed cases of WNV infections were reported from Vellore and Kolar districts during 1977, 1978 and 1981.
Presence of WNV was documented in north- eastern region of India during the year 2006 from four districts (Japanese encephalitis (JE) endemic areas) of Assam; in which11.6% of serum samples of AES (acute encephalitis syndrome) cases were found positive for IgM against WNV (these samples were negative for IgM against JE virus). 
During an outbreak of AES in Kerala, in May 2011, presence of WNV was confirmed in clinical specimens. Since then, WNV encephalitis cases have regularly been reported in Kerala.","The incubation period (the period between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms) of WN fever is usually 3 to 14 days.
20% of people who become infected with WNV will develop West Nile fever whereas about 80% of infected people are asymptomatic (show no symptoms).
Various symptoms of WN fever include- Fever, headache, tiredness, and body aches, nausea, vomiting, sometimes skin rash (on the trunk of the body) and swollen lymph glands.
Severe disease such as West Nile encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of brain and surrounding tissues) show symptoms of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, tremors, coma, convulsions, muscle weakness and paralysis.
Serious illness can occur in people of any age; however people over the age of 50 and some immune-compromised persons (such as person who has received organ transplant) are at greater risk of serious illness.
It takes several weeks or months to recover from serious illness. Some of the neurologic effects may be permanent resulting in long-term sequelae or death.
About 10 % of patients with neurologic complications may die.","West Nile fever is caused by West Nile virus (WNV), belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigenic complex under family flaviviridae.
Transmission of disease- WNV is maintained in nature in a cycle involving transmission between birds and mosquitoes. Humans, horses and other mammals can be infected.
Birds acts both as carriers and amplifying host for WNV. Some bird species especially the crow family (corvidae) are more susceptible to the virus than others. Migratory birds are important in WNV transmission.
Ornithophilic (feeds on birds) mosquitoes belonging mainly to Culex species act as vectors for transmission of infection from infected birds to vertebrate hosts such as Cx.modestus (france),Cx.Vishnui complex(India and Pakistan), Cx univittatus complex(South Africa), Cx. pipiens pipiens(Romania, USA).
When Mosquitoes feed on an infected bird they become infected with the virus. The mosquitoes act as carriers (vectors) spreading the virus from an infected bird to other birds and to other animals. WNV is maintained in mosquito populations by transferring the infection through adults (mosquitoes) to eggs (vertical transmission).
Infection of other animals (e.g. horses, and also humans) is incidental to the cycle in birds since most mammals do not develop enough viruses in the bloodstream to spread the disease. They are “dead-end” hosts. 
The virus may also be transmitted through contact with other infected animals, their blood, or other tissues.
A small proportion of human infections may be transmitted from organ transplant, blood transfusions and breast milk of infected person.","Various diagnostic tests are-
1. IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): IgM can be detected from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum specimens received from WNV infected patients at the time of their clinical presentation. Serum IgM antibody may persist for more than a year.
2. IgG antibody sero-conversion (or significant increase in antibody titers) in two serial specimen collected at a one week interval by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA);
3. Viral detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and
4. Virus isolation by cell culture.","Specific antiviral treatment for West Nile virus infection is not available. In mild infection pain relievers can be used to reduce fever.
For patients with neuro-invasive West Nile virus infection treatment is supportive involving hospitalization, intravenous fluids, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infections. No vaccine is available for humans."
Welding-arc Maculopathy,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/welding-arc-maculopathy,"Welding-arc maculopathy may develop following prolonged exposure to welding arc radiation without adequate protection of eyes. It generally affects young people because of their occupational lack of knowledge and also due to presence of relatively clear ocular media. Most common injury with welding arc radiation is photophthalmia due to ultraviolet (UV) light absorption. Welding-arc maculopathy may be underreported because of its transient clinical features, which may be masked by associated photokeratitis.
The effect of light on retina is being recognised since the time of Plato, who gave description of eclipse blindness.
Photic (related to light) retinopathy is a generalised term used for retinal damage produced by light. This may be due to solar viewing or may be produced even by use of operating microscope.
Increase in retinal temperature is below photocoagulation thresholds. The injury is due to photochemical effects from UV and short blue wavelength exposure. Similar photochemical macular burns may take place after brief exposure to the flash associated with short-circuiting of a high-tension electric current. Use of drug phenothiazine may increase the susceptibility to damage due to the welding-arc radiation.
In metal-arc inert gas welding, the arc is ensheathed with inert gas to prevent oxidation of molten metal. The gas changes emitted radiation into visible and infra-red range, which may produce thermal and photochemical damage to the retina. This is unlike electric arc where the radiation is predominantly in UV range.
The appearance of retinal lesions and clinical course of welding arc exposure are similar to those of solar retinopathy. However, welding-arc maculopathy requires more prolonged exposure as compared to solar retinopathy.","Symptoms include

Unilateral or bilateral diminution of vision.
Post injury visual acuity may be normal or decreased.
Scotoma.
Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light).
Metamorphopsia (distorted vision).
Chromatopsia (objects appear abnormally coloured e.g. erythropsia shows reddish colour).
Afterimage (persistence of image even after removal of stimulus).","Mechanism
There is evidence which suggests that the retinal damage due to welding-arc exposure is probably photochemical rather than thermal, and is primarily caused by the wavelengths at the blue end of the light spectrum.
Similar macular burns may occur following brief exposure to the flash associated with short-circuiting of high-tension electric current.

Prolonged welding-arc exposure over a period of minutes or longer may cause

Facial burn.
Decreased pupillary response.
Central scotoma.
Decrease in vision.
Concentric loss of peripheral field.","Diagnosis depends upon the clinical history, clinical features, and investigative procedures.
Besides clinical history of exposure with characteristic symptoms, patient presents with clinical signs as
A yellow oedematous lesion with greyish borders may develop acutely in the foveal region. There may be multiple spots. Slight exposure may reveal an altered foveal light reflex. With time, this is replaced by irregularity in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In more severe cases, the yellow spot may change to a reddish spot. This may lead to foveal depression or a permanent lamellar defect.
Fluorescein angiography may be normal, but more severe damage may cause foveal RPE defects.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) characteristically shows well-defined outer retinal hypo-reflective space which primarily involves photoreceptor inner and outer segment layers.
Amsler grid testing may delineate small central or paracentral scotoma.


Differential diagnosis

Solar retinopathy.
Light flash or arc, produced by high-voltage electrical short-circuiting.
post-surgical photic retinopathy.
Accidental laser exposure.","There is no effective therapy for welding-arc maculopathy.
Vision usually improves with passage of time. Some patients may be left with permanent defects and loss of vision.
Education of people may reduce visual morbidity."
Xanthelasma,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/xanthelasma,"Xanthelasma (xanthelasma palpebrarum) is a raised, yellow, soft, plaque-like, velvety lesion most commonly seen in the medial canthal (inner junction between upper and lower eyelid) area of the eyelid. It is a common subcutaneous eyelid lesion. It tends to be bilateral and is more common in the elderly. It has slightly more female preponderance. Xanthelasma is known to occur as a result of hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolemia, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Although some patients with xanthelasma have normal lipid levels, others may show hyperlipidaemia (usually type II) or secondary hyperlipidaemia owing to conditions such as biliary cirrhosis or diabetes mellitus.
When it is large and nodular, it may assume tumourous proportions and is then called xanthoma. Tuberous xanthoma appears as solitary or multiple, placoid or papular lesion which has predilection for elbows, knees, fingers and buttocks. Multiple eruptive xanthomas may sometimes occur in patients.
Erasmus Wilson originally described xanthelasma about hundred years ago. This word is derived from the Greek Xanthos meaning ‘yellow’ and elasma, meaning ‘beaten metal plate’. Rarely these may be large enough to obstruct vision.","Patients present with Xanthelasma on the lids thereby disfiguring the face.
Xanthelasma appear as one or more, flat or minimally elevated, placoid, yellowish lesions, affecting skin of eyelids, more commonly on the medial aspect of the lids. It is often bilateral and symmetrical. Sometimes, xanthelasmas coalesce and form raised, large nodular or plaque like lesions.
Elevated and nodular xanthelasma present as tuberous xanthoma.","The aetiology of xanthelasma is not known.
Xanthelasma was considered previously to be a degenerative condition, which involved the subcutaneous and muscular tissue. Now, most agree that this condition occurs as an isolated disorder. Few patients give a family history of xanthelasma.
Xanthelasma may occur as a result of

Hyperlipidaemia.
Hypercholesterolemia.
Obesity.
Cardiovascular diseases.


Pathogenesis
Xanthelasma develops as circumscribed deposits in the soft connective tissue of the eyelids. The deposits consist of histiocytes which contain cholesterol crystals and other lipids and are then turned into foam cells. The development begins in the peri-vascular spaces in the upper dermis.","Diagnosis is usually clinical.
Xanthelasma appear as one or more, flat or minimally elevated, placoid, yellowish lesions, affecting skin of eyelids, more commonly on the medial aspect of the lids. These sometimes occur unilaterally, but are present usually symmetrically on both sides. It is rarely associated with hyperkeratosis and cysts (xanthelasma cysticum). The concomitant presence of xanthelasma cysticum and hyper-pigmentation of the eyelids is described as Hutchinson’s syndrome.
No secondary changes are reported.

Lipid biochemistry
Although xanthelasmas are commonly thought to be associated with hyperlipidaemia, many patients have normal plasma cholesterol levels. However, these patients may have abnormalities in lipoprotein patterns.

Differential diagnosis

Hidradenomas or syringomas: These are small, flat and whitish in colour.
Actinic elastosis with cysts and comedones.
Milia.
Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma: These are deep nodules, inflammatory in nature which may ulcerate.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Patients are treated systemically for any rise in serum lipid levels with lipid-lowering agents. Sometimes, such systemic therapy alone brings about resolution of xanthelasma.
The management of xanthelasma is mainly surgical.
Small lesions are generally observed over time for any increase in size.

Surgical therapy
Surgical therapy is considered for larger or cosmetically unacceptable lesions. After excision, wound may be allowed to heal as such or it is stitched.
Laser treatment may also provide benefit in xanthelasma.
There is high rate of recurrence of disease."
Xerophthalmia,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/eye-ophthalmology-/xerophthalmia,"Xerophthalmia is a condition of early vitamin A deficiency in which cornea keratinises, become opaque and forms dry, scaly layers of cells.

The eye lesions are primarily disease of the young and are a major cause of blindness in developing countries. Although rates of xerophthalmia have fallen, the number of affected children is still high.
Vitamin A deficiency
The risk of vitamin A deficiency is small in children who are getting vitamin A (retinol) or its precursors. Deficiency states are common in many developing countries and are often associated with global malnutrition. Barring impoverished populations, deficiency of vitamin A is rare in developed countries. Vitamin A deficiency may also be seen as a complication with various chronic disorders or diseases in children. Medical history related to dietary habits may be important in identifying nutritional disorders.
In eye, vitamin A is metabolised to form rhodopsin (retinal visual pigment). Action of light on rhodopsin is the initial step in the visual process.
Pre-formed vitamin A is available in foods of animal origin only. Vitamin A may be obtained from carotenes, which are present in green and coloured vegetables and yellow fruits. Carotenes provide vitamin A to the vegetarians.
Malnutrition, especially protein deficiency, may also cause vitamin A deficiency. Clinical or sub-clinical zinc deficiency may also increase the risk of vitamin A deficiency.
Except for vitamin A, toxicity from excess intake of vitamins is less common. Excessive intake of carotene (precursor of vitamin A) may lead to pigmentation of skin (hypercarotenosis). This gets reduced and fades away when intake of carotene is reduced.","Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency are associated with the requirement of vitamin A for the maintenance of epithelial functions.
Symptoms include

Delayed dark adaptation (an early symptom).
Night blindness or nyctalopia (seen in more advanced cases).
Photophobia (sensitivity to light).
Diminution of vision.
Dry and scaly cornea (xerophthalmia).
Conjunctival plaques (Bitot’s spot).
Corneal degeneration (Keratomalacia and corneal ulceration).


Besides eye lesion, child with vitamin A deficiency may have systemic features such as growth retardation, susceptibility to infections, anaemia, diarrhoea, mental retardation, apathy, increased intracranial pressure, and wide separation of the cranial bone at the sutures.","There are low levels of vitamin A in plasma, liver, and extra-hepatic tissues of neonates, as compared to adults. Normal plasma levels increase gradually as child grows.
Vitamin A deficiency and xerophthalmia still occur throughout much of the developing countries and are linked to under-nourishment. Vitamin A deficiency may also be seen as complication in children with various chronic disorders or diseases. Malnutrition, particularly protein deficiency, may cause vitamin A deficiency because of the impaired vitamin A carrying protein.
Eye lesions are the most specific and characteristic features of vitamin A deficiency, but these may manifest rather late in the progression of deficiency. Lesions caused by vitamin A deficiency develop insidiously and rarely manifest before two years of age.
Besides the important features such as delayed dark adaptation, night blindness, and photophobia, the corneal/ conjunctival epithelium is severely affected.

Pathology
Characteristic changes as a result of vitamin A deficiency in epithelial cells include proliferation of basal cells, hyperkeratosis, and formation of cornified squamous epithelium. The combination of defective epithelial barrier to infection, low immune response, and lowered response to inflammatory stress leads to associated health problems.
Delayed adaptation to the dark is due to reduced re-synthesis of visual pigment rhodopsin in retina.
The retinal pigment epithelium degenerates, pigment containing retinal rods and cones loose support and thus break down, resulting in blindness.","Diagnosis depends upon history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations.
A dietary history is important in diagnosis or ruling out low intake, being the aetiological factor.
Early vitamin A deficiency shows delayed dark adaptation.
Keratinised conjunctiva shows Bitot’s spots at a relatively early stage.
Cornea shows dry and scaly layers of cells known as xerophthalmia. Cornea may degenerate and produce keratomalacia, corneal ulceration, necrosis, and permanent corneal scars.

World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria for diagnosis of xerophthalmia in community:
Clinical criteria by ocular signs
XN Night blindness
X1A Conjunctival xerosis
X1B Bitot’s spot
X2 Corneal xerosis
X3A Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia &lt;1/2 corneal surface
X3B Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia ≥1/2 corneal surface
XS Corneal scar
XF Xerophthalmic fundus
Biochemical criteria
Serum vitamin A (retinol) less than 10μg/100 ml (0.35μmol/liter)

Measurement of plasma retinol level is not an accurate indicator of vitamin A status. However, measurement of plasma levels of retinol may be important in cases with severe vitamin A deficiency and with depleted stores in liver.
Clinical or even subclinical vitamin A deficiency is associated with immunodeficiency leading to increased chances of infection such as measles and increased risk of mortality, especially in developing countries.","Management should be carried out under medical supervision.
Xerophthalmia and vitamin A deficiency requires urgent treatment.

Supportive therapy:

Topical artificial tears: Topical artificial tears may be used to lubricate eyes in xerophthalmia.
Wrap around glasses: These prevent against infections and prevent air from further drying the eyes.
Air humidifier: Air humidifier maintains humidity and thus prevents dryness.


Topical therapy:

Topical retinoic acid: Topical retinoic acid (0.1%) in arachis oil, even with concomitant systemic vitamin A therapy, was found to be associated with more rapid healing of corneal lesions in substantial number of patients. A three times a day application of retinoic acid was not associated with conjunctival congestion, corneal vascularisation, or any scarring. Retinoic acid has limited human trials.


Systemic medical therapy:
Vitamin A supplementation for deficiency state depends upon safety and efficacy of its use.
A daily supplement of 1500μg of vitamin A is normally sufficient for latent cases of vitamin A deficiency, but recommended dietary allowance (RDA) levels may be the goal after this intake (which covers needs of &gt;97% of population).
Xerophthalmia cases may require 1500μg/kg of body weight orally for five days followed by 7500μg of vitamin A in oil given intramuscularly, till recovery.
World Health Organisation (WHO) is giving high priority to prevention of vitamin A deficiency in communities where xerophthalmia occurs. They have recommended giving single prophylactic oral dose of retinyl palmitate (an ester of retinol or vitamin A) to pre-school children.

WHO treatment schedule for xerophthalmia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timing Dosage by mouth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immediately on diagnosis (by age):
&lt; 6 months 27.5 mg retinyl palmitate (50000 IU)
6- 12 months 55 mg retinyl palmitate (100000 IU)
&gt;12 months 110 mg retinyl palmitate (200000 IU)
Next day Same age specific dosage 
If clinical deterioration occurs or, when Same age specific dosage 
possible, 1- 4 weeks later
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Intramuscular injection of water- miscible retinyl palmitate at half these dosages may be substituted in rare instances, when swallowing is severely impaired, vomiting is persistent or severe mal-absorption prevents an adequate response.

Surgical therapy:
Surgery plays limited role in the management of xerophthalmia. It is of no use when there is complete corneal necrosis.

Keratoplasty: Keratoplasty for keratomalacia may be associated with poor visual outcome even in those where graft survives.
Amniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation may be done in cases with corneal perforation due to xerophthalmia, as an alternative to keratoplasty."
Yellow Fever,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/yellow-fever,"Yellow fever is a serious viral infection that is spread by a mosquito known as the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The causative agent is virus of the Flavivirus genus. Yellow fever mainly occurs in sub-Saharan Africa (countries to the south of the Sahara desert), South America and in parts of the Caribbean.
There are two forms of yellow fever:UrbanandJungle. Clinically and etiologically they are identical.
Urban yellow feveris an epidemic viral disease of humans transmitted from infected to susceptible persons by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which breed in domestic and peri domestic containers (e.g., water jars, barrels, drums, tires, or tin cans) and thus in close association with humans. In areas where Ae. aegypti has been eliminated or suppressed, urban yellow fever has disappeared. Urban yellow fever can be prevented by vaccinating human populations at risk for infection or by suppressing populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes so that they no longer perpetuate infection.
Jungle yellow fevercan most effectively be prevented by vaccination of human populations at risk for exposure.","Incubation period of yellow fever is 3-6 days. Symptoms occur in 2 stages:
The first stage is also known as the 'acute phase', include:

A high temperature (fever) of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above
Chills (shivers)
Headache
Nausea and vomiting
Muscle pain, including backache
Loss of appetite

Second stage is more severe and is referred to as the 'toxic phase'. The symptoms can include:

A recurrent fever
Abdominal pain
Vomiting
Jaundice– a yellow tinge to the skin and whites of the eyes caused by liver damage
Kidney failure
Bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach, leading to blood in your vomit and stools (faeces)","Yellow fever is caused by a type of virus known as a flavivirus. The infection is transmitted by the bite of certain mosquitoes. If one is travelling, developing risks of yellow fever will depend on:

Where you are travelling to and whether there is currently an outbreak of yellow fever in the area
Whether you have been vaccinated for yellow fever
Whether you are visiting jungle or forested areas","Yellow fever is usually diagnosed based on the symptoms and the results of a blood test.
In blood tests: The blood test may also show a reduction in the number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leucopenia). This can occur because the yellow fever virus affects bone marrow (the spongy material at the centre of some bones that produces blood cells).
Laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever is generally accomplished by testing of serum to detect virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies","There is no specific treatment for yellow fever. However, symptoms can be relieved by symptomatic treatment.

Fever, headache and back pain can be treated with the help of pain-killers like paracetamol. 
In addition, patient should be advised to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics"
Yaws,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/skin/yaws,"Yaws
Yaws is a chronic contagious non-venereal disease, belongs to a group of chronic bacterial infections (endemic treponematoses, nonvenereal spirochetal diseases) caused by treponemes. (Other diseases belonging to this group are bejel (endemic syphilis) and pinta). Yaws is the most common of all and occurs primarily in the warm, humid and tropical areas of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Indian peninsula and the equatorial islands of South-East Asia.
Yaws is caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Yaws is not a fatal disease, but causes disabilities and visible deformities of the face and extremities contributing to stigma and discrimination. It affects the skin, bone and cartilage; if left untreated it can lead to deformities of the nose and bones of the leg. However, the disease can be cured and prevented by a single dose of antibiotics.
In India cases were first reported among tea plantation labourers in Assam in1887. Later on cases occurred in Orissa, Chattishgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other areas.
In India the disease is mostly known by the name of the tribes affected most in any region. Thus for example, the disease is called ‘Madia Roga’ and ‘Gondi Roga’ in Bastar area of Chattishgarh and Sironcha area of Maharashtra respectively and ‘Koya rogam’ in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. Some synonyms of Yaws are based on clinical features like ‘Domaru Khahu’ in Assam which indicates fig like eruption. Chakawar is a term used for chronic ulcers in Central India and part of Uttar Pradesh.
The disease was reported from tribal inhabited districts in states of Chattishgarh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Cases of Yaws were also reported from Madhya Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Assam, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.
The disease has been eliminated from India in 2006 as no new yaws case has been reported after 2003 in the country. It has long been considered by World Health Organization (WHO) that Yaws can be eradicated because humans are the only reservoir.
Eradication of Yaws in India is possible because man is the only reservoir of infection; a single injection of long acting penicillin was effective; infection was localised to small pockets and; no case has been reported after 2003.","There are two basic stages of yaws: early (infectious) and late (non-infectious).
In early yaws, an initial papilloma (a circular, solid swelling on the skin, with no visible fluid) develops at the site of entry of the bacterium. This papilloma is full of organisms and may persist for 3–6 months followed by natural healing. Nocturnal bone pain and bone lesions may also occur in the early stage. These primary skin lesions (Early Yaws) usually occur in children and adolescents in endemic areas.
Late yaws appears after 5 years of the initial infection and is characterized by disfigurement of the nose and bones, and thickening and cracking of the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. These complications on the soles of the feet make it difficult for patients to walk. Late yaws are non-infectious but may make a person disabled.","Yaws is caused by Treponema pertenue which closely resembles to T.pallidium. It is a slender spirochete that is serologically indistinguishable from the spirochete T.pallidium which causes syphilis. The agents found in the epidermis of the lesions, lymph glands, spleen and bone marrow. The organism rapidly dies outside the tissues.
Reservoir of infection- Man is the only known reservoir of yaws. Clinical lesions relapse 2-3 times or more during the first 5 years of infections and serve as source for new infections. The most latent cases are found in clusters centered around an infectious case. There are frequent relapses in latent cases
Transmission-Yaws is transmitted through direct (person-to-person), non-sexual contact with the fluid from the lesion of an infected person to an uninfected persons through minor injuries. Most lesions occur on the limbs. The initial lesion of yaws is filled with the bacteria. The incubation period is 9–90 days (average 21 days).
About 75% of people affected are children under 15 years old (peak incidence occurs in children aged 6–10 years). Males and females are equally affected.
Overcrowding, poor hygiene and poor socioeconomic conditions favours the spread of the yaws","Yaws simulates the lesions of scabies, impetigo, skin tuberculosis, tinea versicolor, tropical ulcer, leprosy and psoriasis. It may also accompany these diseases. Penicillin treatment is very useful in differential diagnosis because of miraculous relief seen in yaws but not in other skin diseases.
Most latent and incubating cases are found in clusters around an infectious case and can usually be diagnosed by epidemiological tracing.
Serology-
Standard laboratory-based tests-
Serological tests are widely used to diagnose treponemal infections (e.g. syphilis and yaws). Serological tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis and its interpretation on adults in yaws endemic areas (disease constantly present in a particular region) need careful clinico-epidemiological assessment.
Commonly used tests are Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test which are inexpensive, rapid and simple to perform. It takes time for sero-positivity to appear after the onset of disease and hence, initial (mother) case may be sero-negative.
Rapid point-of-care tests (medical testing at or near the site of patient care)-Rapid tests allow the point-of-care diagnosis and treatment of patients. There are 2 types of rapid tests:
Rapid treponemal tests are widely used in the diagnosis of syphilis; however, these tests cannot distinguish between present active yaws and past infections. Therefore, its use alone could lead to overtreatment of patients and over-reporting of cases.
New rapid dual (non-treponemal and treponemal) point-of-care syphilis test allows simultaneous yet separate detection of both antibodies. It is now being used in yaws eradication efforts.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Genomic analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)can be used to definitely confirm yaws, and this test will be very useful in the last phase of the eradication programme. The PCR technique can also be used to determine azithromycin resistance from swabs taken from yaws lesions.","Two antibiotics are recommended for the treatment of Yaws by WHO. Persons having any features/ symptoms suggestive of Yaws in endemic areas should consult nearest Government Health facility for confirmation and treatment of Yaws. India has eliminated Yaws in September 2006, 3 years after the last case was detected. Now the country is aiming to achieve yaws eradication. 
The objectives of the Yaws Eradication Programme (YEP) were: (i) Elimination of yaws, defined as zero reporting of cases based on high-quality case searches validated by independent appraisals; (ii) Eradication of yaws, defined as the absence of new cases for a continuous period of 3 years, supported by the absence of evidence of transmission through sero-surveys among children aged 1-5 years."
Zika virus disease,https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/zika-virus-disease,"Zika virus disease is an emerging mosquito borne viral disease. It is transmitted bybite of an infected Aedesmosquito. Zika virus was first identified in Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys. In1952, it was identified in humans, in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania through serological tests. The virus was isolated from human samples in Nigeria in 1968. Outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.
In 2007, the South Pacific recorded its first outbreak of Zika virus in Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. In October 2013, French Polynesia reported its first outbreak.
In May 2015, the public health authorities of Brazil confirmed the transmission of Zika virus in the northeast of the country. Since October 2015, other countries and territories of the Americas have reported the presence of the virus.
Along with Zika virus infection, cluster of microcephaly (condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth) cases and other neurological disorders (Guillain-Barré Syndrome) (GBS) reported in Brazil and a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014.
World Health Organisation (WHO) strongly suspected a causal relationship between zika virus infection during pregnancy and microcephaly and recommended more investigation and research to understand any possible link. No scientific evidence to date confirms a link between Zika Virus and microcephaly or GBS.
On 1st February 2016, WHO announced that the cluster of neurological disorders and neonatal malformations reported in the Americas region constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
Since 2007, Zika viral transmission has been documented in 46 countries and territories including 34 countries which reported autochthonous transmission, or locally acquired infection, between 2015 and 2016, six countries with indication of viral circulation, five countries where the Zika virus outbreak has ended and one country with a locally acquired case but without vector borne transmission(12th February 2016)*.

Zika Outbreak: WHO's Global Emergency Response Plan","A majority of those infected with Zika virus disease either remain asymptomatic (up to 80%) or show symptoms similar to other arbovirus infections such as dengue, and include fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise, and headache.
These symptoms are usually mild and last for 2-7 days.
The incubation period (the time from exposure to symptoms) of Zika virus disease is not clear, but is likely to be a few days.
As compared to Dengue, cases of Zika virus infection has a mild to moderate clinical picture, the onset of fever is more acute and shorter in duration.
Increased cases of Guillain-Barré syndromea (GBS) in general public and microcephalyb in newborns were reported from French Polynesia and Brazil during Zika outbreaks in 2013-2014 and 2015 respectively. Medical experts suspected an association of micocephaly and GBS with Zika virus infection. But no scientific evidence confirms a link so far*.
(a. Guillain-Barré syndrome-It is a condition in which the body’s immune system attacks part of the nervous system. It can be caused by a number of viruses and can affect people of any age. The main symptoms include muscular weakness and tingling in the arms and legs. Severe complications can occur if the respiratory muscles are affected.)
(b. Microcephaly- It is a condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth.)","Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to dengue virus.
Transmission-
Vector-Zika Virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from theAedes genus, mainlyAedes aegypti in tropical regions and subtropical regions. This is the same mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever.
Other species of Ades mosquito Ae. albopictus, Ae. hensilli, Ae. polynesiensis were also found as vector in spread of Zika Virus.
Some evidence suggests Zika virus can also be transmitted to humans through blood transfusion, perinatal transmission and sexual transmission.
Some facts about Ades mosquito-

Ae. aegyptiis closely associated with human environments and can breed in indoor (flower vases, concrete water tanks in bathrooms), and artificial outdoor (vehicle tyres, water storage vessels, discarded containers) environments.
The eggs can survive up to 1 year without water. Once water is available (even small quantities of standing water), the eggs develop into larvae and then adult mosquitoes.
Aedesmosquitoes are active during daylight hours, and usually bite during the morning and late afternoon/evening hours.
FemaleAedesmosquito acquires the virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person.
FemaleAedesmosquito usually flies anaverage of 400 metres. But it may be transported accidently by humans from one place to another (e.g. in the back of the car, plants).","Zika virus infection should be suspected in patients reporting with acute onset of fever, maculo-papular rash and arthralgia, among those individuals who travelled to areas with ongoing transmission during the two weeks preceding the onset of illness.
Zika virus is diagnosed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus isolation from blood samples (for research purpose). Detection of Zika virus by these methods could be done in saliva or urine samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days after symptom onset, or from serum collected in the first 1 to 3 days after onset of disease.
Serological tests, (immunofluorescence assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) may show the presence of anti-Zika virus IgM and IgG antibodies. Diagnosis by serology is difficult as the virus can cross-react with other flaviviruses such as dengue, West Nile and yellow fever.
In India, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi and National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, have the capacity to provide laboratory diagnosis of Zika virus disease in acute febrile stage. These two institutions are the apex laboratories to support the outbreak investigation and for confirmation of laboratory diagnosis. Ten additional laboratories would be strengthened by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to perform the laboratory diagnosis.","There is no specific antiviral treatment for Zika virus. Symptomatic treatment is advised after excluding more severe conditions such as malaria, dengue, and bacterial infection with the consultation of medical personnel. It is important to differentiate Zika virus infection from dengue because of severe complications in some dengue cases. In addition, co-infection with Zika and dengue could occur.
Symptomatic treatment is given in the form of acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever. Antihistaminic drugs may be used to relieve itching due to maculopapular rash.
(The use of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not advised, since the cause of the clinical symptoms could be dengue or chikungunya diseases in which the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is contraindicated*). 
People sick with Zika virus should get rest, and advised to drink plenty of fluids.
Patient isolation-
The patient is recommended to stay under a bed net (treated or without insecticide), or stay in a place with intact window/door screens. These precautions would prevent patient being bitten by mosquitoes in first week of illness and further spread of infection to others.
In addition, physicians or health care workers who attend to Zika virus-infected patients should protect against mosquito bites by using insect repellent and wearing long sleeves and pants.
Newborns with congenital malformations must be monitored to determine any neuro-developmental outcomes.
There is currently no vaccine available."
